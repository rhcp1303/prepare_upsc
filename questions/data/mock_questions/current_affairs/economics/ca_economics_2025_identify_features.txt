4. World Bank reports consistently highlight India's PPP regulatory framework as a global best practice.


Which of the following statements are incorrect?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Private Investment Unit does handle policy, and the NMP aims at asset monetisation. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector projects. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the World Bank does assess India's PPP framework,  characterizing it as a "global best practice" is an oversimplification and requires further qualification.  Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.



**9. Consider the following statements related to India's Human Development Report (HDR) and related indices:**

1. The Human Development Index (HDI) is calculated and published annually by the World Bank.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures inequalities across several dimensions, including reproductive health.

(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The RBI has revised NPA norms, and co-lending is a partnership model. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the revised norms do treat provisioning for bad debts as an expense. Statement 4 is also incorrect; banks are prohibited from co-lending arrangements with NBFCs of their promoter group.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**12. Consider the following concerning wilful defaulters in the Indian banking system:**

1.  The RBI has issued directions on the treatment of wilful defaulters under various Acts.
2.  A wilful defaulter is defined as an individual or entity with an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh or more.
3. The RBI's directions primarily aim to encourage leniency toward wilful defaulters.
4.  The definition of a wilful defaulter includes only corporate entities, excluding individuals.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The RBI has issued directions, and the definition of ₹25 lakh and above is accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the directions aim to address the issue of wilful defaults, not encourage leniency. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the definition includes both individuals and entities. Therefore, only two statements are correct.

How many of the above statements about India's agricultural export policy are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text reports an 8% decline in agricultural exports, not 10%.  Minor numerical inaccuracies can significantly affect the accuracy of the answer.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While rice is a major export, constituting 21% of total exports, it is not the largest. Marine products (15%) also form a substantial share. This tests the candidate's understanding of relative proportions in data.

Statement 3 is correct. Vegetable oil forms 45% of agricultural imports, making it the largest import category.

Statement 4 is correct.  APEDA's role in promoting exports and handling GI registrations for Indian agricultural products abroad is accurately described.

Therefore, only two statements (3 and 4) are accurate. The inclusion of nearly correct but inaccurate figures and a comparative analysis in statements 1 and 2, respectively, makes this a challenging question that requires careful consideration of the provided data.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India:**

1.  UCBs are allowed to open new branches without prior RBI approval, up to a certain percentage of their existing branches.
2.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) is a regulatory body established under the Companies Act, 2013.
3.  The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs is effective from April 1, 2025, and replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
4.  All UCBs, regardless of tier, are subject to the RBI's PCA framework.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Some UCBs are granted the flexibility to expand their branch network without needing prior RBI approval, subject to a percentage limit on the increase.  This is designed to ease expansion for smaller UCBs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NUCFDC is an umbrella organization for UCBs, registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND),  but it's not a regulatory body established under the Companies Act, 2013.  Its role is more supportive and facilitative.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI introduced a revised PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, replacing the earlier SAF. This framework aims to enhance precision and flexibility in addressing the financial health of UCBs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The PCA framework excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The application of the PCA framework is tiered and not universal across all UCBs.


**2. Consider the following regarding the RBI's actions to manage liquidity in the banking system:**

1.  The RBI uses Open Market Operations (OMO) to buy government securities to increase liquidity.
2.  Reducing the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) injects liquidity into the system.
3.  Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions are conducted to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.
4.  Increasing the repo rate and reverse repo rate decreases market liquidity.


Which of the above statements accurately describe RBI's tools for liquidity management?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI's OMO involves buying government securities to inject liquidity into the market. This increases the money supply and lowers interest rates.

Statement 2 is correct. Lowering CRR and SLR frees up funds for banks to lend, thereby increasing liquidity in the system.  These are important tools for influencing the money supply.

Statement 3 is incorrect. VRR is used to *inject* short-term liquidity, not absorb excess liquidity.  The Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) is the mechanism used to absorb excess liquidity.

Statement 4 is correct. Increasing the repo rate and reverse repo rate makes borrowing more expensive for banks, reducing their lending capacity and thus decreasing market liquidity.  This is a contractionary monetary policy tool.


**3. Consider the following features related to the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India:**

1.  NBFCs are permitted to accept demand deposits like commercial banks.
2.  All NBFCs are subject to the same regulatory framework, regardless of their size or activities.
3.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures deposits held in NBFCs.
4.  The RBI employs a scale-based regulatory approach for NBFCs, categorizing them into different tiers based on size and risk.

Which of the above statements accurately reflects the regulatory landscape for NBFCs?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key distinction between banks and NBFCs is that NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits. This is a fundamental difference in their operations and regulatory treatment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI employs a scale-based regulatory framework (SBR) for NBFCs, differentiating regulatory requirements based on size and risk profile.  This is a crucial aspect of NBFC supervision.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  DICGC insurance primarily covers deposits in banks.  Deposits in NBFCs are not covered under the DICGC scheme, making them riskier for depositors.

Statement 4 is correct. The RBI uses SBR to classify NBFCs into tiers based on size, activities, and risk. This allows for tailored regulations based on the specific characteristics of each NBFC category.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the RBI's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS):**

1.  The RB-IOS was launched in 2021 as part of the Alternate Grievance Redressal (AGR) framework.
2.  The scheme covers all types of financial institutions, including microfinance institutions (MFIs).
3.  The RB-IOS handles complaints related to services provided by regulated entities of the RBI.
4.  The scheme provides a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer complaints.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the RB-IOS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RB-IOS is a part of the RBI's broader AGR framework, launched to improve customer grievance redressal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RB-IOS covers a wide range of regulated entities, its coverage is not all-encompassing and doesn't include all types of financial institutions, particularly not all MFIs.  The coverage is specified under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, RBI Act, 1934, and Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.

Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's primary function is to address customer complaints related to services offered by RBI-regulated entities.

Statement 4 is correct. A key feature of the RB-IOS is that it offers a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer grievances, making it accessible to a broader range of customers.


**5. Consider the following regarding Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India:**

1.  The RBI mandates PSL to ensure adequate credit flow to vulnerable sectors.
2.  PSL targets are identical for all types of banks in India.
3.  PSL includes sectors like agriculture, MSMEs, education, and housing.
4.  Scheduled commercial banks have a lower PSL target compared to Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).

Which of the above statements correctly characterize PSL in India?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI mandates PSL to channel credit towards priority sectors, ensuring that these sectors receive adequate funding for their development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PSL targets are differentiated based on the type of bank.  Scheduled commercial banks, RRBs, and other categories have varying PSL targets reflecting their different roles and reach.

Statement 3 is correct. PSL encompasses several crucial sectors including agriculture, MSMEs, education, and housing, promoting inclusive growth.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Scheduled commercial banks typically have a higher PSL target than RRBs, reflecting their larger size and greater capacity to lend to these sectors. RRBs, being focused on rural areas, often have a higher proportion of their lending allocated to priority sectors.


**6. Consider the following about  the  Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark:**

1. The ISI mark is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and indicates product quality and safety.
2.  The Central Government mandates the ISI mark for all products sold in India.
3.  The ISI mark scheme (Scheme I) allows for voluntary adoption by manufacturers.
4.  The ISI mark covers products like electrical appliances, cement, and automobile accessories.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the ISI mark?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ISI mark, now administered by the BIS, is a certification indicating that a product meets specified quality and safety standards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Central Government mandates the ISI mark for *certain* products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), not all products sold in India.  Many products are not subject to mandatory ISI marking.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Scheme I of the BIS allows for voluntary adoption, the government can make it mandatory for specific products through QCOs.  It is not purely voluntary.

Statement 4 is correct. The ISI mark covers a range of products, including those mentioned — electrical appliances, cement, and automobile accessories.  The list of mandated products is extensive and updated periodically.


**7. Consider the following regarding Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  MFIs primarily offer large-value loans to high-income households.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory authority for MFIs in India.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides funding exclusively to MFIs.
4.  MFIs typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.

Which of the above statements accurately describes MFIs and their regulatory environment?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MFIs focus on providing *small-value* loans to *low-income* households, a key element of their social mission.  This is a fundamental aspect of microfinance.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI plays a crucial role in regulating MFIs, particularly those operating as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC-MFIs).  It sets guidelines and oversees their operations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to various small and micro enterprises through various channels, including commercial banks and NBFCs, not exclusively to MFIs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. MFIs often charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks due to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income borrowers and the absence of collateral.  The higher interest rate is a point of frequent criticism of MFIs.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surplus:**

1.  The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of all RBI profits to the central government.
2.  The Malegam Committee's recommendations led to a decrease in surplus transfers from the RBI.
3.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, considers realized equity in determining surplus transfers.
4.  The Currency & Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA) includes only capital and reserves.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of RBI profits to the central government.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Malegam Committee (2013) actually recommended *increased* surplus transfers, not decreased.  Statement 3 is correct. The ECF, as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, uses realized equity (alongside economic capital) as a key factor in determining the amount of surplus transferred to the government.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The CGRA also includes unrealized gains or losses, in addition to capital and reserves.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) scheme:**

1.  WMAs are provided by the RBI to States/UTs to bridge temporary gaps in their revenue and expenditure.
2.  The Union Government does not have access to the WMA facility.
3.  Special WMAs (now SDF) carry a higher interest rate than normal WMAs.
4.  Overdraft (OD) facilities are an alternative financial accommodation instrument for States/UTs.

Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the WMA scheme?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: WMAs are indeed provided by the RBI to States/UTs to manage temporary cash flow mismatches.  Statement 2 is incorrect: The WMA facility is available to both State/UT governments and the Union Government.  Statement 3 is incorrect: Special WMAs (now SDF) have a *lower* interest rate compared to normal WMAs. Statement 4 is correct: Overdraft (OD) facilities, along with SDF, are alternative financial accommodation instruments available to States/UTs when other facilities are exhausted. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding Asset Monetization (AM) in India:**

1.  The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended AM in 2012.
2.  AM was announced in the Union Budget 2020-21.
3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years.
4.  AM primarily involves the outright sale of government assets.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Asset Monetization in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Vijay Kelkar Committee did recommend AM in 2012. Statement 2 is incorrect:  AM was announced in the Union Budget 2021-22, not 2020-21. Statement 3 is incorrect: The NMP targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five. Statement 4 is incorrect: AM primarily involves licensing or leasing of assets, not outright sales, to generate revenue for the government.  Only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements about Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS):**

1.  PACS are regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
2.  District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) are a significant source of funds for PACS.
3.  PACS primarily provide long-term credit loans to farmers.
4.  The government's 'centrally sponsored project for computerisation of PACS' aims to computerise all functional PACS.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of PACS?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are not regulated by the RBI. Statement 2 is correct: DCCBs are a major source of funding for PACS. Statement 3 is incorrect: PACS primarily provide *short-term* credit loans, not long-term. Statement 4 is incorrect: The government's project aims to computerise 63,000 functional PACS, not all. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio:**

1.  A higher CD ratio always indicates greater economic growth.
2.  The RBI aims to increase the CD ratio of Indian banks.
3.  A high CD ratio can lead to liquidity risk for banks.
4.  A high CD ratio is primarily driven by slower deposit growth.


Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the CD ratio?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: While a higher CD ratio can *potentially* stimulate growth, it's not a guaranteed indicator and carries risks. Statement 2 is incorrect: The RBI is concerned about *high* CD ratios and aims to reduce them to mitigate risks. Statement 3 is correct: High CD ratios can expose banks to liquidity risk if they are unable to meet their obligations. Statement 4 is correct: Slower deposit growth, coupled with higher credit growth, contributes significantly to a higher CD ratio. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are accurate.


**6. Consider the following initiatives related to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India:**

1.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates state-level PPP projects.
3.  Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant.
4.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is restricted in Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in the PPP sector.


Which of the above statements correctly describe initiatives within the Indian PPP framework?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The NMP is designed to attract investment through the monetization of government assets. Statement 2 is incorrect: The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects, not state-level ones. Statement 3 is correct: VGF provides up to 40% (not 50%) of project costs as a capital grant to enhance viability. Statement 4 is incorrect:  Up to 100% FDI is permitted (with some exceptions) in SPVs in the PPP sector on an automatic basis for most sectors. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: NUCFDC is a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Statement 2 is incorrect: The need for a UO was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan, not V.S. Das (Das led a later working group that recommended a model). Statement 3 is correct: NUCFDC aims to raise capital and provide fund management and consultancy services to UCBs. Statement 4 is correct: NUCFDC operates as an SRO for the UCB sector. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):**

Which of the above statements accurately describe aspects of NPAs and related frameworks?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: A loan is classified as an NPA if it's overdue for more than 90 days, not 180.  Statement 2 is incorrect: The FSDC is chaired by the Finance Minister, not the RBI Governor. Statement 3 is correct: The SARFAESI Act, 2002, empowers secured creditors to take possession of collateral in case of loan defaults, aiding in NPA recovery.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Priority Sector Lending?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The objective of PSL is to ensure credit flow to vulnerable sections and underdeveloped areas, not solely for profit maximization. Statement 2 is incorrect: The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework for districts with *low*, not high, credit flow. Statement 3 is correct: All bank loans to MSMEs do qualify for classification under PSL. Statement 4 is incorrect: PSL certificates are *tradable* instruments, allowing banks to meet their targets through purchase if they have a shortfall. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**10. Consider the following about the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR):**

1.  MIBOR is a benchmark interest rate for unsecured overnight borrowing in the interbank market.
2.  The RBI has proposed transitioning to a secured money market benchmark to replace MIBOR.
3.  MIBOR is calculated based solely on transactions between large commercial banks.
4.  MIBOR is primarily used for pricing long-term financial instruments.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of MIBOR?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; MIBOR is used for overnight borrowing, but the statement doesn't specify whether it's secured or unsecured. The RBI's recommendation for a shift to a secured benchmark implies that MIBOR itself is not necessarily secured. Statement 2 is correct: The RBI has indeed suggested transitioning to a secured money market benchmark. Statement 3 is partially incorrect: While it primarily involves transactions between banks, it's not limited to only large commercial banks.  Statement 4 is incorrect: MIBOR is primarily used for short-term, not long-term, financial instruments.  Therefore, statements 2 (correct) and 3 (partially correct, but best option given the others) are the most accurate.  The question's wording allows for some interpretation, making (b) the most defensible answer.

**8. Consider the following regarding the  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs):**

1. FVCIs are investors incorporated in India and registered under SEBI regulations.
2.  FVCIs can invest directly in unlisted Indian companies.
3.  Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) are regulated by SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996.
4.  SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2024, amended the existing SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000.

Which of the statements above are accurate concerning SEBI and FVCIs?

(a) 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; FVCIs are incorporated *outside* India. Statement 2 is correct; FVCIs invest in Indian companies, often unlisted. Statement 3 is correct; VCFs are governed by the 1996 regulations. Statement 4 is correct; the 2024 regulations amended the 2000 regulations. Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the relevant aspects of SEBI and FVCIs.


**9. Consider the following  elements related to India's asset monetization initiatives:**

1.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets the monetization of existing government assets.
2.  The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant.
3.  The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) supports the development of PPP projects.
4.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is restricted in the PPP sector under the automatic route.

How many of the above statements correctly describe India's asset monetization initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NMP focuses on monetizing existing assets. Statement 2 is incorrect; VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%. Statement 3 is correct; IIPDF aids in PPP project development. Statement 4 is incorrect; FDI is allowed up to 100% in most sectors under the automatic route for PPP SPVs.  Therefore, only three statements correctly describe the asset monetization initiatives.

Which of the statements above accurately describe India's agricultural policies and initiatives?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; KISAN employs space technology for yield estimation. Statement 2 is incorrect; ADeX's focus is on farmer identity, farm location, and crops sown, not input costs. Statement 3 is correct; ICCC uses AI and GIS technologies. Statement 4 is incorrect; MSP covers a specific set of 22 crops, not all agricultural crops.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty is inherently subjective, but I have aimed for challenging questions with plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding GST:**

1. GST is a direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services.
2. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279B of the Constitution.
3.  The GST Appellate Tribunal hears appeals against orders passed by the Appellate Authority under the CGST Act, 2017 and State GST Acts.
4.  Excise duty on petroleum products is subsumed under the GST regime.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because GST is an *indirect* tax. Statement 2 is incorrect; the GST Council is established under Article 279A, not 279B. Statement 4 is incorrect because excise duty on petroleum and liquor remains outside the GST ambit. The GST Appellate Tribunal's role as a second appellate authority for GST-related disputes is accurately described in statement 3.  The other statements contain factual inaccuracies or misinterpretations of the GST framework.  Understanding the distinction between direct and indirect taxes, the correct constitutional article, and the limitations of the GST's coverage are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Indian taxation.


**2. Consider the following regarding Inverted Duty Structure (IDS):**

1. IDS occurs when import duties on finished goods exceed those on input goods.
2. IDS leads to increased working capital needs for taxpayers due to blocked Input Tax Credit (ITC).
3.  The Ministry of Commerce and Industry exclusively addresses IDS concerns.
4.  IDS primarily impacts the export competitiveness of foreign industries.


Which of the above statements accurately describes aspects of IDS?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct.  IDS is characterized by higher import duties on *input* goods than on finished goods (the opposite of statement 1).  Statement 3 is incorrect as while the Ministry of Commerce and Industry may raise the issue to the Ministry of Finance, it is not solely responsible for addressing it. Statement 4 incorrectly focuses on foreign industries; IDS primarily affects *domestic* industries' ability to compete, both domestically and internationally.  The core issue of IDS—the blocking of ITC and resulting working capital problems—is accurately captured in statement 2, making it the only fully correct statement.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax and the 2024 Finance Bill amendments:**

1. The 2024 Finance Bill reintroduced indexation benefits for all immovable properties.
2. The grandfather clause protects properties acquired after July 23, 2024, from the abolishment of indexation benefits.
3.  The amendment affects only capital gains from immovable properties acquired after July 23, 2024.
4. The abolishment of indexation benefits increases the tax burden on long-term capital gains from immovable properties.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the amendments?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct.  The 2024 Finance Bill *did not* reintroduce indexation benefits (contradicting statement 1); instead, it continued their abolishment but included a grandfather clause.  This grandfather clause applies to properties acquired *before*, not after, July 23, 2024 (contradicting statement 2).  Statement 3 is partially correct in that the amendment's impact is primarily on properties acquired after the cutoff date, but it omits the grandfather clause's existence. Statement 4 accurately points out that removing indexation increases the effective tax rate on LTCG from immovable properties acquired after the specified date.  Therefore, only statement 4 correctly reflects the essence of the amendments.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT):**

1. The CBDT is responsible for administering indirect tax laws.
2. The CBDT functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
3. The CBDT's primary function is the administration of direct tax laws through the Income Tax Department.
4. The CBDT is responsible for the administration of customs duties.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the CBDT's responsibilities?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The CBDT indeed operates under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, and its core responsibility is the administration of direct taxes via the Income Tax Department.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBDT handles *direct*, not indirect, taxes. Indirect taxes are managed by other bodies like the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC). Statement 4 is also incorrect; customs duties fall under the purview of the CBIC, not the CBDT.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the CBDT's role in the Indian tax system.


**5. Consider the following regarding Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs):**

1. DTAAs aim to avoid double taxation of the same asset in multiple jurisdictions.
2. The Principal Purpose Test (PPT) was introduced to prevent the abuse of DTAAs for tax evasion.
3.  DTAAs primarily benefit domestic investors by reducing their tax burden.
4.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism for resolving disputes arising from DTAAs.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of DTAAs?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. DTAAs are designed to prevent double taxation, the PPT is a key mechanism to prevent treaty abuse, and MAP provides a dispute resolution process. Statement 3 is incorrect as DTAAs primarily benefit *foreign* investors by reducing their tax burden in both their home country and the country where they invest. The focus is on facilitating cross-border investment. Therefore, the combination of 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflects the functions and mechanisms associated with DTAAs.



**6. Consider the following statements about the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS):**

1. BIS is responsible for the administration of the Geographical Indications Act, 1999.
2.  BIS develops the ISI mark, a certification of product quality and safety.
3. The BIS Act, 2016, established BIS as the national standards body of India.
4. The Eco Mark is a BIS standard indicating products’ environmental friendliness.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. BIS is indeed responsible for the ISI mark, was established under the BIS Act 2016, and administers the Eco Mark. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Geographical Indications Act is administered by a different government body. The other three statements accurately describe BIS's key functions and legal basis.  The ability to distinguish between the roles of different standard-setting and regulatory bodies is crucial for understanding the Indian regulatory landscape.


**7.  Consider the following regarding  Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Expenditure is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates state-level PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.
4. The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report analyzes PPP regulatory landscapes globally.


Which of the above statements are correct regarding PPPs in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The NMP is a key initiative for PPP investment, and the World Bank report does indeed analyze global PPP frameworks. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Private Investment Unit is located within the Department of *Economic Affairs*, not Expenditure.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector*, not state-level, PPP projects.  Thus, only statements 3 and 4 accurately represent aspects of PPPs in India's context.


**8. Consider the following regarding Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs replaced the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) on April 1, 2024.
2.  All UCBs, except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID), are subject to the PCA framework.
3. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs.
4.  UCBs are allowed to open new branches without RBI approval, provided they do not exceed 10% of their existing branches.


Which of the above statements concerning UCBs are accurate?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The PCA framework excludes UCBs under AID, and the NUCFDC does function as an SRO. Statement 1 is incorrect; the effective date of the new PCA framework is April 1, 2025, not 2024. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while there is relaxed branch expansion for some UCBs, it's not entirely without RBI approval. The key details of the PCA framework and NUCFDC's role are correctly represented in statements 2 and 3.


**9. Consider the following statements on Household Savings in India:**

1. Household savings are categorized solely into financial savings and physical savings.
2. A decline in financial savings poses a risk to banking sector liquidity.
3. The household savings rate is expressed as the ratio of household savings to national income.
4. The household sector in India typically invests all its savings within the sector itself.

Which of the above statements regarding household savings are correct?


(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. A decrease in financial savings directly impacts banks' ability to maintain liquidity and manage credit risk.  Statement 1 is incorrect as household savings are more nuanced than just financial and physical; other categories exist. Statement 3 is incorrect; the household savings rate is expressed as a ratio to *GDP*, not national income.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the household sector typically generates *surplus* savings, lending the excess to other sectors.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a key aspect of household savings in India.


**10. Consider the following regarding Excise Duty in India:**

1. Excise duty is a direct tax levied on goods manufactured within India.
2.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has completely replaced excise duty on all goods.
3. Excise duty on alcohol is collected by the State Governments.
4. The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) is primarily responsible for collecting excise duty.

Which of the above statements regarding excise duty are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. State governments collect excise duty on alcohol, and the CBEC (now CBIC) plays a significant role in excise duty collection, even though GST has subsumed many aspects. Statement 1 is incorrect; excise duty is an *indirect* tax. Statement 2 is incorrect; GST hasn't entirely replaced excise duty, as it still applies to some products like petroleum and liquor.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 offer accurate information on excise duty.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis to avoid plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's tax treaties:**

1.  The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Mauritius was first signed in 1982 and subsequently amended in 2016, incorporating the Principal Purpose Test (PPT).
2.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism within tax treaties designed to resolve double taxation disputes, encompassing both juridical and economic aspects.
3.  The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative is a global effort involving 147 countries and jurisdictions, including India, aimed at curbing tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).  It includes a global minimum corporate tax.
4.  The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA aims to enhance compliance with BEPS minimum standards and prevent treaty abuse for tax evasion.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's approach to international taxation and tax treaties?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate representations of key aspects of India's tax treaties and international tax policies. The India-Mauritius DTAA, a significant treaty, has indeed undergone amendments, notably incorporating the PPT to address treaty shopping and tax avoidance.  The MAP is a crucial mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes arising from international transactions. The BEPS initiative is a globally recognized framework to which India is a signatory, working towards a fairer and more transparent international tax system.  Finally, the amendments to the DTAA are directly aimed at improving compliance with BEPS standards.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding the regulatory landscape of Cooperative Banks in India:**

1.  The RBI revised NPA Provision Norms for Cooperative Banks, mandating that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) under IRACP norms be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account.
2.  The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, primarily focused on restructuring and strengthening cooperative societies in India.
3.  Co-lending, an arrangement where banks and NBFCs partner to provide loans, is subject to RBI guidelines, including a minimum 20% credit risk on NBFCs.
4.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) acts as an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), providing liquidity support and facilitating regulatory compliance.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect recent regulatory changes and initiatives concerning cooperative banks in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe aspects of the regulatory environment for cooperative banks.  The RBI has indeed revised NPA norms, impacting how cooperative banks account for bad debts. The 97th Constitutional Amendment significantly impacted cooperative societies' structure and governance. Co-lending guidelines are a key part of the RBI's regulatory framework for banks and NBFCs. Finally, the NUCFDC plays a crucial role in supporting and regulating UCBs.  Each statement presents accurate information, making (d) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning India's digital public infrastructure (DPI):**

1.  India Stack, India's foundational DPI, comprises three interconnected layers: Identity, Payments, and Data Governance.
2.  The One Future Alliance, a G20 initiative, aims to provide capacity building and technical assistance for DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries.
3.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is intended to serve as a central hub for DPI-related knowledge and resources, launched at the 2023 G20 virtual leaders' summit.
4.  The Unified Payments Interface (UPI), launched in 2016, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), and is expanding internationally.

How many of the above statements accurately describe initiatives related to India's DPI and its global outreach?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct.  India Stack's three-layered architecture is well-established.  The One Future Alliance is a real G20 initiative focused on DPI expansion globally.  The GDPIR was announced as described, aiming to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration. UPI's success and international expansion are also well documented.  Therefore, all four points accurately reflect the status of India's DPI and its global initiatives.


**4. Consider the following regarding initiatives aimed at improving India's infrastructure:**

1.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, launched in 2021, integrates data from various ministries using a digital master planning tool.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment through the monetization of existing government assets.
4.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe elements of India's infrastructure development strategies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of India's infrastructure development.  The PM GatiShakti plan uses integrated data for improved planning and coordination.  The PPP Appraisal Committee is a key part of the PPP process.  The NMP is a significant initiative for attracting investment.  And the Private Investment Unit plays a crucial role in shaping PPP policy.  No statement contains inaccuracies or misleading information.


**5. Consider the following concerning the Coal Sector in India:**

1. India has a high import dependence on coking coal due to the lower gross calorific value (GCV) of domestically produced coal.
2. Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for a significant portion of India’s coal production and supply.
3.  The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, permitted the auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities.
4. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, introduced the Composite Prospecting Licence-cum-Mining Lease (PL-cum-ML) for coal.

How many of the above statements correctly identify challenges and initiatives related to the coal sector in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements accurately describe aspects of India's coal sector.  India's reliance on imported coking coal due to quality differences is a known challenge. CIL's dominance in the domestic market is also a fact.  The 2015 and 2021 Acts represent key legislative efforts to reform and improve the sector's efficiency and private sector participation.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the statements.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a value-added tax (VAT).
2.  It subsumed many types of excise duty.
3.  It is levied on the supply of goods and services.
4.  The GST Council sets tax rates and makes policy decisions.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Goods and Services Tax (GST)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe the GST.  The GST is indeed a value-added tax (VAT), meaning the tax is levied at each stage of production and distribution, with the final consumer bearing the cumulative tax.  The implementation of GST in India significantly altered the indirect tax structure, subsuming many pre-existing taxes like Central Excise Duty and Service Tax.  It is a comprehensive tax levied on the supply of most goods and services within the country. Finally, the GST Council, a constitutional body, plays a crucial role in determining tax rates, formulating policies, and overseeing the overall functioning of the GST system in India. Therefore, option (d) is the most appropriate choice.  Options (a), (b), and (c) omit at least one crucial aspect of the GST, making them incomplete and inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  It is collected by the State Government.
2.  It applies only to petroleum and liquor.
3.  It was earlier levied as Central Excise Duty.
4.  It is an indirect tax on goods manufactured in India.

How many of the above statements correctly describe excise duty in India's current tax system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately reflect the current status of excise duty in India. Statement 1 is partially correct; while excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic preparations is collected by state governments (called "State Excise" duty), excise duty on petroleum products remains a central levy.  Statement 2 is correct;  the GST regime subsumed most other forms of excise duty, leaving only petroleum and liquor products under the excise duty purview.  Statement 3 is partially correct, reflecting the historical context before the GST implementation. Statement 4 is a general description of excise duty, which was true before the GST, but now is only partially true due to the limited application of excise duty. Therefore, only statements 2 and  parts of 1 and 3 are correct, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  It involves higher import duties on input goods than on finished goods.
2.  It leads to Input Tax Credit (ITC) accumulation in GST ledgers.
3.  It makes domestic products more expensive.
4.  It is primarily caused by differences in GST rates between inputs and outputs.

Which of the above are consequences or characteristics of an Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements describe aspects of an Inverted Duty Structure (IDS).  By definition, an IDS exists when import duties (or, in the context of GST, the tax rates) on input goods are higher than on the finished goods. This leads to a situation where businesses have more Input Tax Credit (ITC) than the output tax they need to pay, resulting in blocked working capital.  This accumulation of ITC is a direct consequence of the IDS. The higher cost of inputs due to higher taxes naturally makes the final products more expensive, impacting the competitiveness of domestic industries in both the domestic and export markets. Therefore, option (d) encompasses all the relevant characteristics of an IDS.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  It was announced in Budget 2024-25.
2.  It affects the taxation of immovable properties.
3.  It involves the abolishment of indexation benefits.
4.  A grandfather clause protects properties acquired before a specific date.


Which of the above statements describe the amendment to the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provision on immovable properties?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect the amendment to the LTCG tax provision. The abolishment of indexation benefits for calculating LTCG on immovable properties was indeed announced in the Budget 2024-25. This directly impacts the taxation of immovable properties, making the calculation of the tax liability different from previous years.  The core change is the removal of indexation benefits, a significant alteration in the tax calculation.  Crucially, a grandfather clause was introduced to mitigate the impact on those who acquired properties before a specific cutoff date (July 23rd, 2024), allowing them to continue using the indexation benefit.  Therefore, option (b) is the only option that includes all these key features of the amendment.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  It aims to avoid double taxation on the same asset in different countries.
2.  It promotes cross-border investment.
3.  It involves a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for dispute resolution.
4.  It is an agreement between two or more territories.


How many of the above statements accurately describe a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe the features of a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA).  The primary purpose of a DTAA is to prevent double taxation of the same income or asset in two different countries where a taxpayer is resident or has a taxable presence.  By reducing the tax burden on cross-border investments, DTAAs encourage and facilitate international trade and investment.  Most DTAAs include a Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) mechanism to resolve disputes that may arise between countries regarding the interpretation or application of the agreement. Finally, a DTAA is a bilateral (or sometimes multilateral) agreement, signed between two or more countries or jurisdictions. Therefore, option (d) is the most accurate description of a DTAA.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  It is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  It supports long-term infrastructure financing.
3.  It is a non-profit organization.
4.  It is entirely owned by the Government of India.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements accurately describe NaBFID. NaBFID is indeed regulated and supervised by the RBI as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI).  Its primary objective is to support long-term non-recourse infrastructure financing in India, playing a crucial role in the development of the country's infrastructure.  Currently, the entire shareholding of NaBFID is held by the Government of India. However, NaBFID is not a non-profit organization; it is a specialized financial institution. Therefore, option (b) correctly identifies the accurate statements.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  It is worth $70 billion in 2022.
2.  It accounts for about 7% of India's total retail market.
3.  100% FDI under the automatic route is permitted in the marketplace model.
4.  FDI is not permitted in the inventory-based model.


Which of the above statements accurately describe India's e-commerce market?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of India's e-commerce market.  The market size is indeed significant, valued at $70 billion in 2022 and accounting for approximately 7% of the total retail market. The marketplace model of e-commerce allows for 100% FDI under the automatic route.  Conversely, FDI is restricted in the inventory-based model to protect the interests of India's unorganized retail sector. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer as it includes all the accurate statements.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a digital repository to prevent biopiracy.
2.  It is aligned with the Convention on Biodiversity.
3.  It guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge.
4.  It is a legally non-binding resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly.

How many of the above statements refer to initiatives or instruments related to the protection of traditional knowledge and genetic resources in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements describe initiatives or instruments designed to protect traditional knowledge (TK) and genetic resources (GRs) in India. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is a digital repository created to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents on traditional knowledge.  The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity, focusing on fair and equitable benefit sharing. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions. Statement 4, however, refers to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which is an international instrument but not a specific Indian initiative.  Therefore, option (c) is correct.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  It integrates data from various ministries.
2.  It uses ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.
3.  It is built on open-source technology.
4.  It is primarily focused on promoting private sector investment in infrastructure.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately describe the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP). The PMGS NMP integrates data from various ministries and departments, providing a comprehensive view of ongoing and planned infrastructure projects. It leverages ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps for spatial planning and project visualization.  It is built on open-source technology, making it accessible and adaptable. However, while PMGS NMP aims to improve infrastructure development, its primary focus is not solely on promoting private sector investment; it aims to integrate various modes of transport and infrastructure for efficient logistics and development through a holistic approach.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  It rebates customs duty on imported materials.
2.  It helps exporters offset costs during the export process.
3.  It is disbursed electronically to exporters' bank accounts.
4.  It is administered by the Department of Economic Affairs.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the Duty Drawback scheme in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately describe the Duty Drawback scheme. The scheme does indeed rebate customs duty on imported or excisable materials used in the manufacture of export goods, helping exporters to offset some of the costs incurred in the export process.  The CBIC (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs) now disburses duty drawback amounts electronically to exporters' bank accounts.  However, the Department of Economic Affairs is not directly involved in the administration of the Duty Drawback scheme; it is the CBIC under the Ministry of Finance that handles it. Therefore, option (a) is the correct choice.


**11. Consider the following:**

1.  It is imposed on industries with significantly above-average profits.
2.  It was recently reduced on domestically produced crude oil.
3.  It is a type of direct tax.
4.  It is primarily aimed at generating revenue for infrastructure development.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the Windfall Tax in India?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately describe the windfall tax. A windfall tax is indeed imposed on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favourable market conditions (e.g., high global oil prices).  The windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil has recently been reduced by the government.  However, the windfall tax is an indirect tax, not a direct tax. While the revenue generated might contribute to general government expenditure, including potentially infrastructure development, it is not its primary aim. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (a) the appropriate answer.


**12. Consider the following:**

1.  It aims to increase e-commerce penetration.
2.  It is a platform-centric model.
3.  It uses open specifications and protocols.
4.  It is a non-profit organization.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately describe ONDC.  ONDC's primary aim is to democratize digital commerce and increase e-commerce penetration by enabling the participation of a wide range of sellers.  It employs open specifications and protocols, making it different from platform-centric models like Amazon or Uber.  It is structured as a Section 8 company, making it a non-profit organization. However, ONDC is explicitly a network-centric model, not a platform-centric model.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct, making (a) the correct option.


**13. Consider the following:**

1.  It is expressed as a ratio of household savings to GDP.
2.  A share of household financial savings goes towards government borrowings.
3.  It includes both financial and physical savings.
4.  A decline in the rate indicates increased investment in the private sector.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the household savings rate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements accurately describe the household savings rate.  The household savings rate is indeed expressed as the ratio of household savings to GDP.  A portion of household financial savings is usually directed towards government borrowings through the purchase of government securities.  The overall household savings encompass both financial savings (like deposits and insurance) and physical savings (like gold and real estate). However, a decline in the household savings rate does not automatically indicate increased investment in the private sector; it could be due to various factors, including changes in consumption patterns and investment opportunities.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct, making (a) the correct option.


**14. Consider the following:**

1.  It aims to position India as a global leader in technical textiles.
2.  It includes the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles.
3.  It mandates the usage of technical textiles by all industries.
4.  It involves the development of new HSN codes for technical textiles.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the National Technical Textiles Mission?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Three statements correctly describe the National Technical Textiles Mission.  The mission does aim to establish India as a global leader in the technical textiles sector.  It incorporates the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic production.  The mission also involves the development of new Harmonized System (HSN) codes specifically for technical textiles products to improve classification and trade statistics. However, the mission does not mandate the usage of technical textiles across all industries; the mandate is for specific central ministries/departments.  Therefore, option (a) is the most accurate description.


**15. Consider the following:**

1.  It measures the combined performance of eight core industries.
2.  Petroleum Refinery products have the highest weight in the index.
3.  It comprises 40.27% of the weight of items included in the IIP.
4.  It is released by the National Statistical Office.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately describe the ICI. The ICI indeed measures the combined performance of eight core industries.  Petroleum Refinery products do hold the highest weight within the ICI.  The eight core industries constitute approximately 40.27% of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). However, the ICI is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the National Statistical Office. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.



**1. Consider the following features related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India:**

1.  It is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services.
2.  It subsumed many types of excise duty, except for petroleum and liquor.
3.  The GST Council, a constitutional body, sets tax rates and makes policy decisions related to GST.
4.  The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act introduced GST in 2017.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the GST in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the GST in India.  Statement 1 correctly defines GST as a comprehensive indirect tax on the supply of goods and services. Statement 2 accurately notes that GST subsumed many previous excise duties, with the notable exceptions of petroleum products and alcohol. Statement 3 correctly identifies the GST Council's role in setting tax rates and policy. Finally, Statement 4 correctly states that the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act was instrumental in implementing GST in 2017.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the GST Appellate Tribunal:**

1. It is a second appellate authority established under the Central GST (CGST) Act, 2017.
2.  It consists of a Principal Bench in New Delhi and various State Benches.
3. The President of the GSTAT is appointed by the Government of India, independent of the Chief Justice of India.
4.  It hears appeals against orders passed by the Appellate Authority under CGST Act, 2017 and State GST Acts.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the GST Appellate Tribunal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the GST Appellate Tribunal.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the President of the GSTAT is appointed after consultation with the Chief Justice of India or their nominee.  The other three statements accurately reflect the Tribunal's role as a second appellate authority, its bench structure, and its jurisdiction over appeals arising from CGST and State GST Acts.


**3. Consider the following entities related to India's indirect tax system:**

1.  Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)
2.  GST Council
3.  GST Appellate Tribunal
4.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)

How many of the above are directly involved in the administration or adjudication of indirect taxes in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The CBEC (now largely subsumed under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs), the GST Council, and the GST Appellate Tribunal are all directly involved in India's indirect tax system.  The CBEC was historically responsible for excise duty collection. The GST Council sets policy and rates, and the GSTAT adjudicates disputes.  NUCFDC, while involved in the financial sector, is not directly involved in the administration or adjudication of indirect taxes.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe aspects of PPPs in India. The Private Investment Unit's role, the Appraisal Committee's function, and the core aim of PPPs to attract private investment are all correct.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the NMP is directly related to PPPs as it seeks to monetize government assets to attract private investment, thereby facilitating infrastructure development through PPP models.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs):**

1.  APAs are agreements between a taxpayer and a tax authority to determine transfer pricing methods.
2.  They aim to provide certainty to taxpayers regarding transfer pricing for a maximum of five future years.
3.  The Arm's Length Principle is irrelevant to APA determination.
4.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is involved in signing APAs in India.

How many of the above statements accurately describe APAs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. APAs are indeed agreements determining transfer pricing, providing certainty for a maximum of five years, and the CBDT is actively involved in the Indian APA regime. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Arm's Length Principle is fundamental to APA determination, as it ensures that transactions between related parties are priced as if they were between unrelated parties.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) regulatory actions:**

1.  The RBI has issued a Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs).
2.  The RBI regulates the banking functions of UCBs under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
3.  The RBI directly manages the Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) of UCBs.
4.  The RBI's Omnibus Framework recognizes Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect RBI's regulatory actions concerning UCBs and other entities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  The RBI has implemented a PCA framework for UCBs, regulates their banking functions, and has established an Omnibus Framework for SROs.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the RBI has addressed the issue of DEFs in UCBs, it does not directly manage them.  The RBI's role is primarily supervisory and regulatory.


**8. Consider the following concerning India's financial inclusion initiatives:**

1.  NABARD's All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) provides data on rural financial inclusion.
2.  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
3.  PACS are the grassroots-level arms of the short-term cooperative credit structure.
4.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) plays a significant role in rural financial inclusion.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's financial inclusion landscape?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

3.  Geological Survey of India has identified significant reserves of gold and diamonds in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
4. The rules mandate the use of the United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC) and Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) Template for Exploration Stages.

Which of the above statements are completely accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While offshore mining primarily focuses on deep seabed resources beyond 200 meters, it doesn't exclusively target polymetallic nodules.  India's offshore resources include a variety of minerals like heavy mineral placers, phosphorite, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, besides polymetallic nodules.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 rules clearly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals listed in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, from their purview.

Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading in its presentation. While Geological Survey of India has indeed delineated offshore mineral resources, the statement's assertion of significant gold and diamond reserves requires clarification. The report highlights other minerals more prominently. The presence of gold and diamonds is not the primary focus of the reported resources.

Statement 4 is correct. The rules explicitly incorporate modified versions of the UNFC and CRIRSCO Template for standardizing exploration and reporting procedures, ensuring international best practices are followed in assessing and developing offshore mineral resources.  This is crucial for attracting foreign investment and ensuring sustainable development.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are completely accurate.

2. The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme emphasizes a product-specific approach, tailoring strategies to individual agricultural products for export markets.
3. The Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme exclusively covers international freight costs for agricultural products.
4. APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) is primarily responsible for domestic agricultural marketing and price stabilization.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the scope of the respective initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While TIES (Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme) does support border haats, its scope extends to other export-linked infrastructure projects like land custom stations, cold chains, and trade promotion centers. It's not limited solely to border haats.

Statement 2 is correct. The MAI (Market Access Initiative) Scheme is specifically designed to address market-specific needs and develop tailored export strategies for different agricultural products in various target countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The TMA (Transport and Marketing Assistance) Scheme covers both international and domestic components of freight and marketing costs for agricultural products.  It's not limited to international freight alone.

Statement 4 is incorrect. APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) primarily focuses on promoting agricultural exports, managing GI registration for Indian products abroad, and overseeing the accreditation of Certification Bodies for organic exports.  Its role is not primarily in domestic agricultural marketing and price stabilization.

Consequently, only statements 2 are entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements about India's steel sector:**

1. India's steel production is heavily reliant on imported coking coal from Australia to meet its total demand.
2. India's per capita finished steel consumption significantly exceeds the global average.

2. A person is identified as 'MPI poor' if deprived of one-third or more of the weighted indicators.
3.  The NMPI (National MPI) in India uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS).
4. The NMPI includes indicators related to maternal health and bank accounts.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MPI focuses on deprivations across education, health, and living standards, providing a comprehensive view of multidimensional poverty.  While employment is a significant factor in overall well-being, it is not directly measured by the MPI.

Statement 2 is correct. The threshold for classifying an individual as 'MPI poor' is based on a weighted average of deprivations across multiple indicators, with the one-third benchmark being a key criterion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMPI in India utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  The NFHS provides relevant data on health and other social indicators.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Indian NMPI expands on the global MPI by incorporating additional indicators specifically related to maternal health and access to bank accounts, reflecting the country's context.


Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, making (c) the correct option.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, concluded the Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and established the World Trade Organization (WTO) as its successor.  The WTO expanded the scope of trade agreements beyond tariffs to include services, intellectual property, and other areas.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Marrakesh Agreement addressed a broader range of trade issues than just tariff reductions.  It significantly expanded the scope of trade rules to encompass areas such as agriculture, services, and intellectual property rights. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Agreement on Agriculture was a crucial part of the Marrakesh Agreement, demonstrating a significant focus on agricultural trade.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture:**

1. It was negotiated during the Tokyo Round and ratified in Marrakesh.
2. It exclusively focuses on export subsidies, neglecting market access and domestic support.
3. "Tariffication" refers to converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.
4. The "Peace Clause" provides a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  The Agreement on Agriculture, negotiated during the Uruguay Round (not the Tokyo Round), deals with market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.  "Tariffication" is the process of converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, a key component of the Agreement. Statement 1 is incorrect as it was negotiated during the Uruguay Round. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Agreement on Agriculture covers market access and domestic support, along with export subsidies. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the "Peace Clause" is an interim, not permanent, solution to the PSH issue.


**3. Consider the following concerning the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):**

1. It aims to promote harmful subsidies that deplete fish stocks.
2. It immediately came into force upon adoption at the 12th Ministerial Conference.
3. Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) provisions were included for developing countries.
4. India is a signatory to this agreement.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb, not promote, harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of fish stocks.  The agreement did include Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) provisions to accommodate the specific needs and circumstances of developing and least-developed countries. However, the agreement requires ratification by two-thirds of WTO members before it comes into force, and as of December 2024, it hadn't reached that threshold.  India, as mentioned in the text, is not part of the agreement. Therefore, only statements 3 is correct.


**4. Consider these aspects of the TRIPS Agreement:**

1. It was developed during the Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations.
2. It sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.
3. It is an optional agreement that WTO members can choose to join.
4. It primarily focuses on protecting geographical indications (GIs) for agricultural products.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement was developed during the Uruguay Round, not the Tokyo Round. It establishes minimum standards for IPR protection, making it a mandatory part of WTO membership, not optional. While it does address GIs, its scope is much broader than just agricultural products, covering patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect; Duty Drawback aims to reduce, not increase, the cost of exports.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics and infrastructure, designed to be challenging and fact-based.  Remember, the goal is to test deep understanding and recall, not simple comprehension.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's infrastructure development initiatives:**

1.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways.
2.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) project, managed by DFCCIL, seeks to increase the share of rail freight traffic to 45% by 2030.
3.  The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) aims to improve the efficiency of road freight transport.
4.  The Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) is designed to enhance multimodal logistics efficiency.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the goals and features of these initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately describe aspects of India's major infrastructure development plans. Bharatmala Pariyojana's target of 65,000 km of National Highway construction is well-documented.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors aim to significantly boost rail freight's share, and the Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) directly addresses road freight efficiency.  Finally, the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) is a key initiative aimed at improving multimodal logistics, encompassing various modes of transport.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements.


**2. Consider the following statements related to India's participation in international payment systems:**

1.  Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative involving India and Russia to enhance cross-border payments.
2.  The Unified Payments Interface (UPI), launched in 2016, is managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
3.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is involved in Project Nexus, an initiative aimed at interlinking domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS).
4.  NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) is collaborating with several ASEAN countries to expand the reach of UPI.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect because Project Nexus is a *multilateral*, not bilateral, initiative involving several countries, not just India and Russia.  Statement 2 is incorrect; UPI is developed and managed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the RBI. Statement 3 is correct: The BIS Innovation Hub is indeed the conceptualizer of Project Nexus, and the BIS includes the RBI amongst its member central banks. Statement 4 is also correct: NIPL is actively working to internationalize UPI, and its partnership with Trinidad and Tobago shows its involvement in expanding UPI beyond India.  The combination of correct and incorrect statements makes this question challenging.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's foreign trade and investment policies:**

1.  The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS).
2.  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the nodal department for formulating FDI policy.
3.  Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) are permitted to invest only in companies listed on major stock exchanges.
4.  The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is a private institution focusing on international business.

Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; RoDTEP did indeed replace MEIS. Statement 2 is also correct; DPIIT is responsible for FDI policy.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. FVCIs invest in venture capital funds *or* venture capital undertakings, which are *not* necessarily listed on major stock exchanges.  Statement 4 is incorrect; IIFT is a public institution (autonomous, but under the Ministry of Commerce) and a premier centre for foreign trade education and research.  The combination of true and false statements, particularly with plausible-sounding false statements, makes this question demanding.


**4. Consider the following about India's port sector and related initiatives:**

1. The Vadhavan Port, once operational, will be India's largest container port.
2. The Mormugao Port Authority is the first port in India to implement the Green Ship Incentives (Harit Shrey) scheme under the Environmental Ship Index (ESI).
3. The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023 ranked Yangshan Port (China) as the top-performing container port globally.
4.  Dry ports, also known as inland ports, reduce the pressure on coastal ports by providing an inland gateway to international trade.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are all correct. Vadhavan Port is planned to be one of India's largest deep-water ports and a major container terminal. Mormugao Port has indeed pioneered the Harit Shrey scheme within the ESI framework.  Dry ports are designed to alleviate pressure on coastal ports by providing inland connectivity for international trade.  Statement 3 is also correct, reflecting the CPPI 2023 rankings. All statements are factually accurate, making this a question testing detailed knowledge of India's port infrastructure.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's digital public infrastructure (DPI) initiatives:**

1.  India Stack's identity layer primarily relies on the Aadhaar biometric identification system.
2.  The One Future Alliance is a G20 initiative aimed at promoting DPI adoption in high-income countries.
3.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was launched to establish a dedicated institution for DPI development.
4.  The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is collaborating with India to promote DPI implementation globally.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's DPI initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Aadhaar forms the core of India Stack's identity layer. The GDPIR is indeed designed as a focused institution for DPI. The EU-India TTC partnership is focused on accelerating DPI development and deployment. Statement 2 is incorrect; the One Future Alliance is specifically aimed at supporting *low* and *middle*-income countries, not high-income nations.  The inclusion of a subtly incorrect statement increases the difficulty of this question.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning India's tax policies and international agreements:**

1.  The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS aims to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate of 20%.
2.  India signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS in 2017.
3.  The Duty Drawback scheme, under the Customs Act, 1962, rebates customs duties on imported materials used in export goods.
4.  Windfall taxes are levied on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favorable market conditions.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are all accurate.  India's participation in the BEPS convention, the function of the Duty Drawback scheme, and the definition of windfall taxes are all correctly stated.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the global minimum corporate tax rate under the BEPS framework is 15%, not 20%. The inclusion of this slightly inaccurate figure makes the question more challenging, necessitating precise knowledge.


**7. Consider the following regarding  India's railway safety initiatives:**

1.  In the last five years, approximately 75% of railway accidents in India involved derailments.
2.  The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) is a ten-year fund dedicated to enhancing railway safety infrastructure.

4.  KAVACH is an indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the facts concerning railway safety in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The high percentage of derailments in recent railway accidents, the safety advantage of LHB coaches, and the indigenous nature of the KAVACH system are all accurately reflected. Statement 2 is incorrect; RRSK is a *five*-year, not ten-year, fund.  The slight inaccuracy in the duration of the RRSK makes this a more difficult question.



**8. Consider the following regarding Public Financial Institutions (PFIs) in India:**

1.  Institutions with at least 51% of their paid-up share capital held by the central or state government can be designated as PFIs.
2.  The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) was established under the Companies Act, 2013.
3.  NaBFID's primary objective is to provide short-term, recourse-based financing for infrastructure projects.
4.  The Central Government notified NaBFID as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 correctly defines the criteria for an institution to be designated as a PFI. Statement 4 is also correct; the government's notification of NaBFID's PFI status was indeed under the Companies Act, 2013. Statement 2 is incorrect; NaBFID was established under its own Act (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021), not the Companies Act, 2013. Statement 3 is also incorrect; NaBFID focuses on *long-term*, *non-recourse* financing, not short-term, recourse-based financing. The combination of correct and incorrect statements, requiring careful differentiation based on specific details, makes this question challenging.


**9. Consider the following about the World Trade Organization (WTO) and related agreements:**

1. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, established the WTO, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2.  The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) reached a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.
3. The "de minimis" limits under the PSH policy refer to the maximum permissible level of agricultural subsidies.
4.  Developed countries generally advocate for higher "de minimis" limits for agricultural subsidies.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement is the foundational document establishing the WTO. The "de minimis" limits define the threshold for permissible agricultural subsidies under the PSH policy. Statement 2 is incorrect; MC13 did *not* reach a permanent solution to the PSH issue.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; developed countries generally argue for *lower*, not higher, de minimis limits to prevent trade distortion.  The presence of both correct and incorrect statements, with subtle differences in meaning, makes this a demanding question.


**10. Consider the following aspects of India’s logistics sector:**

1. The government has planned 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) with a projected investment of $6.2 billion.
2. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, integrating ISRO satellite imagery.
3. The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) with Russia will allow the militaries of both countries to share logistics and support facilities.
4.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state sector PPP projects.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The planned MMLPs and their investment outlay, the use of BISAG-N's tool in PM GatiShakti, and the purpose of the RELOS agreement are all accurately described.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee primarily evaluates *central* sector projects, not both central and state sector projects. The inclusion of a specific detail (the level of government projects evaluated) that differentiates a correct from an incorrect answer makes this a challenging question.


**1. Consider the following statements related to the TRIPS Agreement:**

1.  It incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.
2.  It covers copyrights, trademarks, geographical indications, and patents, but excludes industrial designs.
3.  Dispute settlement under TRIPS obligations is handled through the WTO's dispute settlement procedures.
4.  It explicitly prohibits compulsory licensing under any circumstances.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the TRIPS Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) is a significant WTO agreement that harmonizes intellectual property rules across member nations. Statement 1 is correct; TRIPS does draw upon and incorporate provisions from WIPO's established conventions, aiming for a common standard of IP protection. Statement 3 is also correct; the WTO's well-defined dispute settlement mechanism is the avenue for resolving disagreements concerning TRIPS obligations.  Statement 2 is incorrect because industrial designs are explicitly included within the scope of TRIPS.  Statement 4 is incorrect; TRIPS allows for compulsory licensing, a crucial provision that permits countries to produce patented products or processes without the patent holder's consent under specific circumstances, often invoked to address public health concerns or national emergencies. This flexibility is particularly relevant for developing nations. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India:**

1.  From independence until economic liberalization, GFCF remained consistently below 10% of GDP.
2.  GFCF reached its peak as a percentage of GDP around 2007-08.
3.  Private investment, a component of GFCF, has shown uninterrupted growth since 2011-12.
4.  GFCF includes changes in stock of raw materials and net acquisition of valuables.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the trends and composition of GFCF in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; GFCF in India did reach its highest point as a percentage of GDP around 2007-08. Statement 4 is also correct; GFCF's calculation encompasses changes in the stock of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods, and net acquisition of valuables. However, statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF hovered around 10% of GDP for a considerable period, it fluctuated slightly above and below that figure.  Statement 3 is incorrect; private investment as a part of GFCF experienced a decline starting in 2011-12, before showing signs of recovery later. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following aspects of India's Microfinance sector:**

1.  SEWA Bank, established in 1974, was India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI).
2.  Microfinance loans, as defined by the RBI, are collateral-free loans exclusively to individuals with annual incomes exceeding ₹3,00,000.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans only to corporate entities.
4.  The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's microfinance sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; SEWA Bank holds the distinction of being India's pioneering MFI. Statement 4 is also correct; the Malegam Committee played a crucial role in formulating the regulatory landscape for NBFC-MFIs in India.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the RBI's definition of microfinance loans includes collateral-free loans to low-income households with annual incomes *up to* ₹3,00,000. Statement 3 is incorrect; PMMY specifically targets non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the characteristics of India's microfinance sector.


**4. Consider the following about the RBI's Monetary Policy:**

1.  The RBI's monetary policy primarily aims to achieve sustainable economic growth and maintain price stability.
2.  Monetary policy transmission refers to the direct impact of policy rate changes on the exchange rate.
3.  The current monetary policy framework in India employs flexible inflation targeting.
4.  The RBI Act, 1934, does not provide the statutory basis for the RBI's monetary policy.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the RBI's monetary policy and its framework?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the dual mandate of the RBI's monetary policy is to ensure sustainable economic growth while maintaining price stability.  Statement 3 is also correct; India currently adopts a flexible inflation targeting framework. Statement 2 is incorrect; monetary policy transmission is a broader process encompassing the impact of policy rate changes on various economic variables, including but not limited to the exchange rate. It influences inflation, credit availability, investment, and overall economic activity. Statement 4 is incorrect; the RBI Act, 1934 (as amended), provides the statutory basis for the RBI's monetary policy functions. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.



**5. Consider the following concerning the RBI's Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index):**

1.  The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial exclusion.
2.  The FI-Index incorporates data from banking, investment, insurance, and postal sectors.
3.  The FI-Index is published bi-annually.
4.  The FI-Index includes parameters related to Access, Usage, and Quality of financial services.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the RBI's FI-Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the FI-Index indeed integrates data from various sectors including banking, investments, insurance, and postal services, reflecting a comprehensive view of financial inclusion. Statement 4 is also correct; the index considers parameters related to access, usage, and quality of financial services. Statement 1 is incorrect; a score of 100 on the FI-Index represents complete financial inclusion, not exclusion.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the FI-Index is published annually, not bi-annually.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.



**6. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS):**

1.  RB-IOS was launched in 2021 as part of RBI's Alternate Grievance Redress (AGR) framework.
2.  RB-IOS covers all commercial banks but excludes Regional Rural Banks.
3.  The objective of RB-IOS is to provide a cost-free redressal mechanism for customer complaints.
4.  RB-IOS is formed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the RBI Act, 1934.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the RB-IOS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; RB-IOS is a component of RBI's AGR framework. Statement 3 is also correct; it aims to provide a cost-effective and accessible redressal system for customer grievances. Statement 4 is also correct;  the legal basis for RB-IOS includes provisions under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the RBI Act, 1934.  Statement 2 is incorrect; RB-IOS encompasses Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) along with commercial banks within its coverage. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the RB-IOS.


**7. Consider the following statements related to RBI's surplus and its transfer to the government:**

1.  RBI's surplus arises from the excess of its expenditure over its income.
2.  Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of RBI's profits to the central government.
3.  The Malegam Committee (2013) recommended a decrease in surplus transfers to the government.
4.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, considers realized equity and economic capital in determining surplus transfer.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the RBI's surplus transfer mechanism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; Section 47 of the RBI Act mandates the transfer of profits to the central government. Statement 4 is also correct; the ECF, a framework developed by the Bimal Jalan Committee, takes into account realized equity and economic capital when deciding on surplus transfers. Statement 1 is incorrect; RBI's surplus is the excess of *income* over *expenditure*, not the other way around. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Malegam Committee's recommendations led to an *increase*, not a decrease, in surplus transfers.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the RBI's surplus transfer mechanism.



**8. Consider the following regarding Ways and Means Advances (WMA) in India:**

1.  WMAs are provided by the RBI to states/UTs to meet temporary mismatches in their cash flows.
2.  The facility is only available to state governments and not to the Union Government.
3.  Special WMA (now SDF) has a higher interest rate than Normal WMA.
4.  Apart from WMA, the Overdraft (OD) facility is another financial accommodation instrument for states/UTs.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the WMA scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; WMAs are a crucial tool for managing short-term cash flow imbalances for states/UTs. Statement 4 is also correct; states/UTs can utilize overdraft facilities as an additional financial accommodation instrument. Statement 2 is incorrect; the WMA facility is available to both state governments and the Union Government.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Special WMA (now SDF) carries a *lower* interest rate compared to the Normal WMA. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately describe the WMA scheme.



**9. Consider the following about the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF):**

1.  The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 5% per annum.
2.  The AIF's eligible activities include the creation of infrastructure for viable farming assets.
3.  The AIF credit guarantee coverage is exclusively provided by CGTMSE.
4.  The AIF includes integrated primary and secondary processing projects in its list of eligible activities.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the AIF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the AIF supports infrastructure development for viable farming assets. Statement 4 is also correct; integrated processing projects are included among the eligible activities. Statement 1 is incorrect; the interest subvention under AIF is 3%, not 5%.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while CGTMSE provides credit guarantee coverage, NAB Sanrakshan has also been included to extend the coverage to FPOs. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately describe the AIF.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's Agritech initiatives and related reports?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the KISAN project aims to enhance yield estimation accuracy. Statement 4 is also correct; the WEF report categorizes agritech into four broad areas, including intelligent crop planning, smart farming, farmgate-to-fork, and data as an enabler. Statement 1 is incorrect; FASAL focuses on forecasting agricultural output, while KISAN is about crop insurance. Statement 3 is incorrect; the AI4AI initiative aims to *scale* agritech services, not limit them.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately describe India's Agritech initiatives and related reports.




**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII)
2.  The Gender Development Index (GDI)
3.  The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)
4.  The Human Development Index (HDI)

How many of the above indices are used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to measure human development,  and include a gender-based component or comparison?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNDP utilizes several indices to assess human development, with some specifically focusing on gender disparities. The HDI is a broad measure of human development, but the GII, GDI, and IHDI all incorporate gender-related data. The GII measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation. The GDI compares the HDI achievements of women and men, revealing gender gaps in human development. The IHDI adjusts the HDI to account for inequalities within a country, implicitly considering gender disparities as a factor influencing overall inequality.  Therefore, three of the listed indices (GII, GDI, and IHDI) directly incorporate gender-based analysis or comparisons.  While the HDI itself doesn't explicitly focus on gender, gender inequality affects overall HDI scores, making it indirectly related.  Option (d) is incorrect because the HDI's focus is broader than gender-specific analysis, although gender inequality influences its value. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of indices with a gender-related component.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report incorporates data on education, health, and living standards.
2.  The MPI was launched in 2010 and is jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI.
3.  India's National MPI (NMPI) includes indicators on maternal health and bank accounts, in addition to the global MPI indicators.
4.  The World Bank's report on "Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet" discusses the concept of a "polycrisis" affecting global poverty reduction.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of multidimensional poverty measurement and related concepts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of multidimensional poverty measurement and related concepts. Statement 1 correctly identifies the key components of the MPI. Statement 2 accurately describes the MPI's launch date and the organizations involved in its publication.  Statement 3 is correct; the NMPI expands upon the global MPI by adding specific Indian context indicators.  Statement 4 is also correct; the World Bank report indeed discusses the concept of a "polycrisis" and its impact on global poverty reduction efforts.  Therefore, all four statements are factually accurate and relevant to the topic.  Choosing any option other than (d) would be incorrect, as it would imply that some of these established facts are inaccurate.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to increase seaweed production.
2.  Seaweed farming is part of aquaculture and contributes significantly to India's GDP.
3.  India has established an expert committee chaired by Dr. V.K. Saraswat to review seaweed farming policy.
4.  Offshore seaweed cultivation has begun in the Andaman region.

How many of the above statements accurately describe initiatives related to seaweed farming in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements accurately reflect initiatives related to seaweed farming in India. Statement 1 is correct; the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has a target for seaweed production.  Statement 3 is also accurate; the expert committee under Dr. V.K. Saraswat exists.  Statement 4 correctly notes the commencement of offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region. However, Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While seaweed farming is part of aquaculture, aquaculture's contribution to India's GDP is stated as 1.5%, not a significant portion. The question tests knowledge of specific details and programs related to seaweed farming, not general economic contribution. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate, making (c) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) would be incorrect as they would either overestimate or underestimate the number of accurate statements.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  India is the world's largest silk producer.
2.  Karnataka is the leading silk-producing state in India.
3.  India produces all four varieties of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.
4.  The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its platinum jubilee.


How many of the above statements about India's silk production are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements are accurate. Statement 2 is correct; Karnataka is the leading producer. Statement 3 is also correct; India produces all four silk varieties mentioned. Statement 4 is accurate; the Central Silk Board did celebrate its platinum jubilee. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; India is the *second* largest silk producer globally, not the largest.  The question tests specific facts about India's silk industry, emphasizing the need for precise recall.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, as it identifies the three accurate statements. Options (a), (b), and (d) would be incorrect because they misrepresent the factual accuracy of the statements provided.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Agri Stack initiative aims to create digital identities for farmers.
2.  The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) uses data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS.
3.  The Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) is used for soil profile mapping.
4.  The Agri Stack initiative has a target of creating digital identities for all farmers within one year.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features of the Agri Stack initiative in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately describe features of the Agri Stack initiative. Statement 1 is correct; creating digital farmer identities is a core objective. Statement 2 is also correct; the DSS utilizes data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; DGCES is used for yield estimation, not soil profile mapping. Statement 4 is incorrect; the target for creating digital farmer identities is three years, not one.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Agri Stack's components and timelines.  Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the number of correct statements.  Other options misrepresent the factual accuracy of the statements.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme has a total outlay of Rs. 1702 crore.

Therefore, three of the listed items are directly related to the growth and development of India's textile industry. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the number of relevant initiatives and indices.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding inheritance tax:**

1. It is levied on the total value of a deceased person's assets.
2.  It aims to reduce wealth inequality and promote intergenerational equity.

4.  Potential implications include tax evasion and discouragement of savings.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Inheritance tax, unlike estate tax, is levied on the inheritance received by the beneficiaries, not the entire estate of the deceased.  Estate tax, on the other hand, taxes the total value of the deceased's estate.  Statement 2 is correct; reducing wealth inequality and promoting intergenerational equity are key objectives of inheritance taxes.  Statement 3 is incorrect; India currently does not have an inheritance tax.  While estate duty existed previously, it was abolished. Statement 4 is correct; potential negative consequences of inheritance tax include tax evasion and a potential disincentive for savings and investment. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the history of inheritance and related taxes in India:**

1. Estate duty was introduced in 1953 and abolished in 1985 due to its high tax rate.
2. Gift tax was introduced in 2004 and is currently in effect.
3. Wealth tax was abolished in 1998 and has not been reintroduced.

Which of the above statements accurately reflects the tax history of India?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the introduction and subsequent abolition of estate duty in India due to its unpopularity stemming from its high tax rate (reaching up to 85%). Statement 2 is also correct, as gift tax was reintroduced in 2004, though it has specific exemptions.  Statement 3 is incorrect; wealth tax was abolished in 2015, not 1998. Statement 4 is incorrect as there is no inheritance tax in India currently.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following statements related to wealth and income inequality in India:**

1.  The World Inequality Lab study shows that the top 1% controls over 40% of total wealth.
2.  Inequality in India has consistently increased since independence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the findings of the World Inequality Lab study on wealth distribution in India. Statement 2 is largely correct; while inequality declined post-independence, it began rising in the 1980s and accelerated in the 2000s. Statement 3 is incorrect; India's CRI Index ranking is lower than that of Nepal and Sri Lanka, indicating higher inequality. Statement 4 is incorrect; the bottom 50% holds a considerably small portion (6.4%) of total wealth, highlighting significant inequality.  Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

4.  APAs are only applicable to bilateral agreements, not unilateral ones.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding APAs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the CBDT did indeed sign a record number of APAs in FY 2023-24. Statement 2 is incorrect; APAs can involve both domestic and international transactions to determine transfer pricing for multinational corporations. Statement 3 is correct; a primary function of APAs is to mitigate transfer pricing disputes and provide certainty regarding tax liabilities. Statement 4 is incorrect; APAs include both unilateral and bilateral agreements.  Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are correct.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and agricultural aspects.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural exports in 2023-24:**

1.  Rice constituted the largest share of total agricultural exports.
2.  Vegetable oil was the most significant agricultural import.
3.  India's share of global agricultural exports exceeded its share of global agricultural imports.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While rice was a significant export, constituting 21% of the total, the text indicates that other products might have individually had a larger share, even though the text doesn't specify which one. The text itself doesn't provide enough information to conclusively determine the largest exported agricultural product.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that vegetable oil comprised 45% of India's agricultural imports, making it the largest import category.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that India's share of world agricultural exports in 2022 was 2.4%, while its share of imports was 1.9%.  Therefore, the export share was slightly higher than the import share, but the statement is still false because the question specifically asks for 2023-24 data and the text only provides the 2022 data.  The text states that both exports and imports declined in 2023-24, but without specific percentages, we cannot definitively compare their shares.


**2. Consider the following initiatives aimed at promoting agricultural exports in India:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

TIES (Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme) directly addresses infrastructure development related to exports, such as cold chains and border haats.  MAI (Market Access Initiative) Scheme explicitly focuses on improving market access through product-specific and country-specific strategies.  MSP (Minimum Support Price) is a domestic price support mechanism for farmers and does not directly relate to export promotion.  Therefore, only TIES and MAI schemes are directly concerned with improving export-related infrastructure and market access.


**3. Consider the following statements about India's pulses production and import:**

1.  Pulses are a less water-intensive crop compared to many other crops.

3.  The primary objective of Vadhavan Port is to enhance India's capacity for handling dry bulk cargo.
4.  Vadhavan Port is designed to be India's largest deep-water port, specializing in container handling.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the features and planned function of the Vadhavan Port project?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the Vadhavan Port project.  Vadhavan Port will indeed become India's 13th major port upon completion, expanding the country's port infrastructure. Its location near Dahanu in Maharashtra is a crucial strategic element for its operations.  The port is planned to be one of India's largest deep-water ports, with a particular focus on container handling, which will significantly boost India's container shipping capacity.

4.  RELOS is primarily focused on enhancing civilian trade and commerce between India and Russia.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features and objectives of RELOS and similar agreements India has with other countries?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe key features of the RELOS agreement.  The agreement grants access to logistics and support facilities, including the replenishment of essential supplies, for both militaries during peacetime and wartime operations.  This is a crucial aspect of enhancing operational capabilities and interoperability.

1.  DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
2.  DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
3.  USOF was funded through a levy on licensees of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
4.  DBN primarily focuses on funding telecom infrastructure in urban areas.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the establishment, funding, and objectives of the Digital Bharat Nidhi?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the context and funding mechanisms of DBN. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, is indeed the legal basis for the establishment of DBN.  DBN directly replaced the USOF, signifying a shift in the approach to funding telecom initiatives.  The USOF's funding mechanism involved a levy imposed on DoT licensees, a crucial aspect of its financial structure.  However, statement 4 is incorrect.  DBN's primary focus is on expanding telecom services and infrastructure in underserved rural and remote areas, aiming to bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable access to communication technologies.  The fund is designed to support affordable connectivity in areas lacking sufficient telecom infrastructure, not urban areas which generally have better coverage.  Therefore, only three statements correctly describe DBN's establishment, funding, and objectives.

1.  The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) is an autonomous agency under the Department of Space (DoS).
2.  The Indian Space Association (ISpA) is a government-owned company responsible for commercial space activities.
3.  New Space India Limited (NSIL) is a Schedule 'A' Category Company under DoS, handling ISRO's commercial activities.
4.  A venture capital fund of ₹1,000 crore has been announced to support space tech startups and SMEs.

How many of the above statements accurately describe key organizations and initiatives promoting private sector participation in India's space sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect key aspects of India's space economy promotion initiatives. IN-SPACe is correctly identified as an autonomous agency under DoS, playing a crucial role in facilitating private sector participation. NSIL is accurately described as a Schedule 'A' company under DoS, responsible for handling ISRO's commercial activities. The announcement of a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund to support space tech startups and SMEs is also accurate, reflecting a commitment to fostering private sector growth in the space industry.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. ISpA is not a government-owned company; it's an apex non-profit industry body established to represent and support the interests of private players in the Indian space sector.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the relevant organizations and initiatives.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the PLFS.  The PLFS was indeed launched in 2017 to provide crucial data on employment and unemployment. Its methodology relies on a nationwide sample survey to collect data representative of the Indian labour market.  The PLFS data is extensively used by policymakers to guide the formulation and implementation of employment-related policies and programs.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The PLFS covers both the formal and informal sectors of the Indian economy, providing a comprehensive picture of the labour market dynamics across different sectors.  The survey aims to capture the employment situation across the entire spectrum of the Indian economy, not just the formal sector. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the PLFS.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant gold consumer, China holds the top position globally in terms of gold consumption.  India consistently ranks among the top consumers, but it is not the largest.

Statement 2 is correct.  According to available data, Bihar holds the largest gold reserves within India.  This is based on geological surveys and estimates of gold deposits in the state.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although Karnataka has gold reserves, they are not the second largest in India.  Rajasthan generally holds this position, according to available data, following Bihar.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While Switzerland is a major player in the global gold market, and a significant exporter, the provided data does not suggest it is a primary exporter *to* India.  Other countries, particularly those closer geographically, are more likely to be major gold exporters to India.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.



**3. Consider the following about the IFSC Authority:**

1. The IFSC Authority is a regulatory body established under the IFSC Act, 2019.
2. Its jurisdiction extends to all financial institutions in India.
3.  It regulates financial products, services, and institutions within Indian IFSCs (International Financial Services Centres).
4. The IFSC Authority is directly under the control of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).


Which of the statements correctly describe the IFSC Authority and its functions?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IFSC Authority is indeed a statutory body established under the IFSC Act, 2019.  This act created the framework for the regulation of financial activities within the IFSCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IFSC Authority's jurisdiction is limited to the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, not all financial institutions across the country.  Other regulatory bodies, such as the RBI, oversee financial institutions outside of these designated IFSCs.

Statement 3 is correct.  The core function of the IFSC Authority is to regulate and develop financial products, services, and institutions operating within the IFSCs.  This includes oversight of banking, insurance, and other financial activities within these specific zones.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in India's overall financial system, the IFSC Authority operates as an independent regulatory body.  It is not directly under the RBI's control, although there may be coordination and cooperation between the two. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe the IFSC Authority.



**4. Consider the following about Nidhi Companies:**

1. Nidhi Companies are regulated under the Companies Act, 2013.
2. Their primary objective is to provide financial assistance to the general public.

Which of the above statements accurately describe Nidhi Companies and their characteristics?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nidhi Companies are indeed declared and regulated under the Companies Act, 2013, with specific regulations outlined in the Nidhi Rules, 2014.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary objective of Nidhi Companies is to cultivate thrift and savings among *their members*, not the general public.  They operate on a mutual benefit basis, primarily serving the financial needs of their own members.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Nidhi Companies are restricted to accepting deposits from and lending only to their members. This mutual benefit structure is a core element of their operational framework.  They cannot engage in financial transactions with non-members.

Statement 4 is correct.  A minimum of two hundred members is a key criterion that must be met for a company to be registered as a Nidhi Company.  This requirement helps ensure a sufficient member base to support the mutual benefit structure. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Unified Payments Interface (UPI):**

1.  UPI was launched in 2016 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) developed the UPI system.
3.  UPI facilitates instant real-time payments.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the UPI and its features?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a crucial role in India's financial system and supports the UPI, it did not directly launch the system.  The UPI was developed and launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

Statement 2 is correct. The NPCI, an entity established by the RBI and Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), is the developer and operator of the UPI system.

Statement 3 is correct.  UPI is designed for instant real-time payments, facilitating fast and efficient transactions between bank accounts.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While UPI initially focused on domestic transactions within India, there is a growing push for international expansion.

(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty was adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), not the WTO.  WIPO is the specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for intellectual property rights.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary aim of the treaty is to improve the efficiency and transparency of the patent system, particularly concerning genetic resources and traditional knowledge.  It seeks to prevent the wrongful granting of patents.

Statement 3 is correct.  India, along with numerous other countries, has adopted the treaty, signifying its commitment to protecting intellectual property rights in relation to genetic resources and traditional knowledge.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the treaty is adopted by consensus, it is not automatically binding on all WIPO member states.

(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS agreement was negotiated under the World Trade Organization (WTO), not the WHO.  It forms a crucial part of the WTO's framework for international trade.

Statement 2 is correct.  A central function of TRIPS is to establish minimum standards of intellectual property protection that member countries must uphold.  This ensures a certain level of consistency and predictability in intellectual property rights across the global trading system.

1.  Financial savings include investments in gold and silver.
2.  A decline in financial savings impacts banking sector liquidity.
3.  The household sector typically invests more than it saves.
4.  Physical savings are defined as currency and deposits.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect:  Physical savings, not financial savings, include gold and silver.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the distinction between financial and physical savings.

Statement 2 is correct: The text directly links a decline in financial savings to challenges for banking sector liquidity and credit risk management.

Statement 3 is incorrect:  The text states that the household sector typically generates *surplus* savings, lending the excess to other sectors; it doesn't invest more than it saves.

Statement 4 is incorrect: Physical savings, as defined in the text, include physical assets, not currency and deposits (which are financial savings).


**6. Consider the following statements about the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Compensation Cess:**

1.  It was established under the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2018.
2.  It is levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods.

2.  Some UCBs can open new branches up to a certain percentage of their existing branches without prior RBI approval.
3. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the UCB sector and accepts public funds.
4. The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by a committee chaired by Shri V.S. Das.

How many of the above statements are accurate depictions of the regulatory environment for UCBs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI's expanded purview over UCBs includes aspects of management, governance, and winding-up procedures.  Statement 2 is also accurate;  the ease of expansion for certain UCBs allows for branch openings up to a specified limit without prior RBI approval. Statement 3 correctly identifies NUCFDC's role as an SRO and its acceptance of public funds, aligning with its Type II NBFC-ND classification.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While a working group led by Shri V.S. Das did recommend a model, the initial highlighting of the need for a UCB umbrella organization was done by the RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following features of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The PCA framework aims to address the financial health of UCBs with greater precision and flexibility, replacing the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).

(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the PCA framework is designed for greater precision and flexibility and replaces the SAF. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the framework excludes UCBs under AID, its effective date is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024. Statement 3 accurately identifies capital, asset quality, and profitability as key monitoring areas. Statement 4 correctly describes the exit criteria from PCA. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following aspects of Microfinance (Microcredit) in India:**

1.  Microfinance loans, as defined by the RBI, include all collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The annual income limit for microfinance loans as defined by the RBI is up to ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it. Statement 2 is correct; MFIs generally charge higher interest rates compared to commercial banks. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; while PMMY does provide loans to small/micro enterprises, the original loan limit was up to ₹10 lakh,  but the 2024 budget increased this limit for the Tarun Plus category. Statement 4 is therefore also incorrect. Only statements 2 is entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS):**

3. The scheme covers all commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and Scheduled Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks with deposits exceeding ₹50 crore.
4.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), except Housing Finance Companies, with assets under ₹100 crore are included.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the RBI's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

Statement 2 accurately reflects the scheme's objective. Statement 3 correctly identifies the coverage of various banking institutions exceeding the specified deposit size. Statement 4 is also correct regarding the inclusion of NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets above ₹100 crore. Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the RB-IOS.

1. SFBs must have a minimum net worth of ₹500 crore and a satisfactory performance track record of at least 3 years.
2.  They must be scheduled banks with net profits in the last financial year and Gross Non-Performing Assets (G-NPA) less than 2%.
3.  Their shares must be listed on a recognized stock exchange, and promoter requirements necessitate no changes to existing promoters or shareholding dilution plans.
4.  SFBs with a diversified loan portfolio will be given preference during the transition process.

Which of the above accurately reflects the RBI's eligibility criteria for SFBs transitioning to Universal Banks?


(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum net worth required is ₹1000 crore, not ₹500 crore, and the satisfactory performance track record should be for a minimum of 5 years. Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  While profitability is a requirement, the G-NPA limit is 3%, not 2%, and net profits must be for the last two financial years. Statement 3 accurately states the share listing requirement and the restrictions on promoter changes. Statement 4 correctly highlights the preference given to SFBs with diversified loan portfolios.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the RBI's criteria.


**6. Consider the following about Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):**

1.  NPAs represent loans where borrowers have defaulted on their contractual obligations, leading to credit risk for the lender.
2.  The RBI's biannual Financial Stability Report (FSR) highlights achievements in reducing NPAs.
3.  Liquidity risk arises when banks are unable to meet their payment obligations, potentially exacerbated by high NPA levels.
4.  The revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be charged to the Profit and Loss Account.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of NPAs and their implications?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of NPAs. Statement 1 correctly defines NPAs as loans with defaulted borrowers, resulting in credit risk. Statement 2 accurately points to the FSR's role in highlighting NPA-related achievements. Statement 3 correctly identifies liquidity risk as a potential consequence of high NPA levels. Statement 4 correctly states the new NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks, mandating that BDDR provisions be charged to the Profit and Loss Account.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India:**

1.  NBFCs are allowed to accept demand deposits like commercial banks.
2.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures deposits in NBFCs up to ₹5 lakh.
3.  The National Housing Bank regulates Housing Finance Companies, while SEBI regulates Merchant Bankers and Venture Capital Funds.
4.  Scale-based regulation (SBR) for NBFCs segregates them into tiers based on size, activity, and riskiness, applying differential regulations.

How many of the statements above accurately describe the regulatory landscape for NBFCs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NBFCs, unlike banks, cannot accept demand deposits. Statement 2 is also incorrect; DICGC insurance does not cover NBFC deposits. Statement 3 accurately reflects the regulatory roles of NHB and SEBI. Statement 4 correctly describes the SBR framework for NBFCs.  Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4) are accurate.


**8. Consider the following initiatives related to microfinance in India:**

1. The Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) and Sa-Dhan were recognized as Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) in 2012 by the RBI.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MFIN and Sa-Dhan were recognized as SROs in 2014, not 2012. Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme and the 2022 harmonized regulations. Statement 4 is also correct as the 2024 budget enhanced the limit to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) for those who had successfully repaid previous Tarun loans.  Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.



**9. Consider the following concerning the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) was launched in 2022.
2.  The PMGS NMP utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, employing GIS technology and integrating ISRO satellite imagery.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the PMGS NMP was launched in 2021, not 2022. Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the plan's technological foundation and integration of various ministry projects. Statement 4 is incorrect; the PMGS NMP is built on open-source technology and hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the ISI mark and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the ISI mark is developed by BIS to assure product quality and safety. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Central Government makes the ISI mark mandatory for *certain* products, not all products sold in India. Statement 3 is correct, reflecting the BIS's establishment and aims. Statement 4 is also correct; BIS manages Hallmark and Eco Mark certifications.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the new PCA framework's design. The framework intends to provide a more precise and adaptable approach to managing the financial health of UCBs, replacing the SAF from April 1, 2025. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are indeed the central parameters for monitoring UCB performance under this framework.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the framework specifically excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  Statement 5 is also incorrect; the exit criteria require no breaches for four consecutive quarters, not two. Therefore, only four statements (1,2,4, and the corrected version of 5) accurately describe the framework.


**2. Consider the following features related to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1.  It is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).

How many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics and functions of NUCFDC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 5 are accurate descriptions of NUCFDC's role and functions.  It does act as an SRO for UCBs and assists them in meeting BRA, 1949 compliance. Statement 4 is partially correct, as the need was first highlighted by Viswanathan's group, but the model was recommended by Das's group. This makes it partially incorrect for the purpose of this question.  Statement 1 is incorrect because NUCFDC is a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Statement 3 is also incorrect, as its capital-raising target is ₹300 crores, not ₹500 crores.  Therefore, only three statements (2, 4-partially correct, and 5) are correct.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to the Indian microfinance sector:**

1.  The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank is the second Microfinance Institution (MFI) established in India.

(b) 2, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5
(d) Only 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SEWA Bank was India's *first* MFI. Statement 2 is incorrect; the income limit for microfinance loans is *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it. Statement 3 is also incorrect as the original limit was ₹10 lakh; the budget increased it. Statement 4 is correct; the Malegam Committee did indeed recommend a regulatory framework. Statement 5 is correct reflecting the 2024 budget announcement.  Therefore, only statements 4 and 5 are entirely correct.


**4. Consider the following aspects of the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP):**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the WBG-GP was initiated in 2024, not 2023. Statement 2 is incorrect; the aim is to *boost* guarantee issuance, not reduce it. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; the platform consolidates at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), not the IFC. Statement 4 is correct; World Bank guarantees are indeed focused on mitigating risks in infrastructure projects. Statement 5 is also correct; these are the types of coverages offered.  Therefore, only two statements (4 and 5) are entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the initiatives under the "Pandemic Fund Project" by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying:**

4.  Major interventions include upgrading animal health laboratories and vaccine manufacturing facilities.
5.  The project focuses solely on strengthening early warning systems for pandemic preparedness.


How many of the above statements are accurate concerning the Pandemic Fund Project?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the project's funding is $25 million, not $15 million.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the project targets low- and middle-income countries, not high-income ones. Statement 3 is correct; the ADB, World Bank, and FAO are indeed the implementing entities. Statement 4 is correct; laboratory and vaccine facility upgrades are key components.

Statement 4 is incorrect; the 2016 IPR policy has a broader scope than just patent enforcement.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the TKDL aims to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents but is not directly involved in the patent filing process itself.  The question tests both factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct aspects of intellectual property protection.  The inclusion of misleading statements about the scope of the 2016 policy and the TKDL's role increases the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's efforts to promote Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) globally:**

1.  The One Future Alliance is a G20 initiative focused on providing financial and technical support for DPI implementation in developing countries.
2.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is designed to store and share digital identity data across nations.
3.  The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is primarily concerned with promoting DPI development in Africa.
4.  The Social Impact Fund (SIF) is an initiative to accelerate DPI implementation across global South nations.
5.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is an initiative focused on building capacity and providing technical assistance for DPI implementation.


Which of the above statements are accurate descriptions of India's initiatives to promote DPI globally?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct; the One Future Alliance and the SIF are indeed focused on supporting DPI adoption in developing countries. Statement 5 is also correct; GDPIR aims to build capacity and provide technical assistance. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; GDPIR is not designed for sharing digital identity data across nations but for a more general focus on DPI.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the EU TTC has a broader scope than just focusing on Africa.  The question tests knowledge of specific initiatives and their objectives.  The inclusion of statements that are partially true or false, and the subtle differences between the roles of GDPIR and the SIF, make this a challenging question.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council:**

1. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279B of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Union Finance Minister serves as the Chairperson of the GST Council.
3. The GST Council's decisions are binding on all states.
4. The GST Council has the power to amend the GST Act.
5. The GST Council comprises representatives from both the central and state governments.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the structure and functions of the GST Council?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct.  The Union Finance Minister chairs the Council, its decisions are binding on states (though they require subsequent legislation), it has the power to amend the GST Act (subject to parliamentary approval), and it comprises both central and state government representatives. Statement 1 is incorrect; the relevant constitutional article is 279A, not 279B.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the GST Council's constitutional basis and operational framework.  The inclusion of a subtle error regarding the constitutional article number, alongside other factual statements, makes for a challenging question.


**7. Consider the following statements about the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1.  It is solely focused on improving road infrastructure across India.
2.  The plan utilizes data from ISRO satellites and Survey of India basemaps.
3.  It is built on a proprietary, closed-source technological platform.
4.  It integrates the projects of various ministries, including Bharatmala and Sagarmala.
5.  It is managed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.


How many of the above statements accurately describe features of the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The plan does leverage ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps. Statement 1 is incorrect; PM GatiShakti has a multi-modal approach encompassing various infrastructure sectors, not just roads. Statement 3 is incorrect; it's built on open-source technology. Statement 4 is correct; it does integrate various ministries' projects. However, the statement is oversimplified. Statement 5 is incorrect; it is not solely managed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.  This question tests knowledge of the PM GatiShakti plan's technological underpinnings, scope, and governance.  The inclusion of misleading information about the plan's scope and management structure enhances the difficulty level.


**8.  Consider the following regarding the National Technical Textiles Mission:**

1. The mission aims to make India the world's largest producer of technical textiles.
2. The mission includes initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles.
3. The mission mandates the use of technical textiles in all sectors of the Indian economy.
4. The mission involves the development of quality control regulations for various types of technical textiles.
5.  The mission is primarily focused on promoting the export of technical textiles.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the goals and strategies of the National Technical Textiles Mission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The PLI scheme is part of the mission's strategy, and the development of quality control regulations is a key component. Statement 1 is partially correct; the mission aims for global leadership, but not necessarily the largest producer. Statement 3 is incorrect; the mandatory usage is for some Central ministries/departments, not all sectors. Statement 5 is partially correct, but the mission also focuses on domestic needs and self-reliance.  This question tests comprehension of the National Technical Textiles Mission's multifaceted approach.  The nuanced nature of the goals and strategies, and the use of partially correct statements, contributes to the question's difficulty.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the  Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS):**

1. RELOS is a bilateral agreement that allows participating countries' militaries to access each other's bases and ports for logistical support.
2.  RELOS agreements are limited to only countries with which India has major defense collaborations.
3.  RELOS agreements facilitate the replenishment of only fuel and rations during wartime.
4.  India has RELOS agreements with all the members of the G7.
5.  RELOS agreements can be utilized during both wartime and peacetime missions.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the features and scope of the RELOS agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 5 are correct. RELOS indeed allows access to logistics and support facilities at each other's bases and ports and can be used in both wartime and peacetime. Statement 2 is incorrect; it's not limited to countries with major defense collaborations. Statement 3 is incorrect; it covers a wider range of supplies. Statement 4 is incorrect; India doesn't have RELOS agreements with all G7 members.  This question tests knowledge of a specific international agreement and its implications.  The inclusion of statements that are partially true or false, and the use of geographically-based distractors, enhances the difficulty level.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Unified Payments Interface (UPI):**

1. UPI was launched in 2017 and is operated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  UPI facilitates instant real-time fund transfers between bank accounts.
3.  UPI is exclusively available for use within India.
4.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is responsible for the operation of UPI.
5.  UPI transactions are not subject to any transaction fees.


How many of the above statements are factually correct about the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. UPI does facilitate instant transfers, NPCI operates it, and  UPI transactions are generally free for users. Statement 1 is incorrect; UPI launched in 2016, and it's not operated directly by the RBI, but by NPCI. Statement 3 is incorrect; UPI is expanding internationally.  This question tests knowledge of a key financial technology and its operational details. The inclusion of incorrect details regarding the launch year and the operating entity makes the question challenging.  The seemingly simple statement about transaction fees also acts as a distractor.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural sector:**

1.  The agriculture and allied sector contributed 18.2% to the Gross Value Added (GVA) at current prices in 2022-23.
2.  The output of the crop sub-sector declined from 62.4% to 54.3% between 2011-12 and 2022-23.
3.  India's agricultural activities are 47% mechanized, lagging behind countries like China (60%) and Brazil (75%).
4.  R&D expenditure in the agricultural sector constitutes 0.4% of agricultural GDP.
5.  Approximately 51% of the net sown area in India is rain-fed agriculture.

Which of the above statements correctly reflect the challenges and realities of India's agricultural sector?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** All five statements accurately represent aspects of India's agricultural sector.  Statement 1 reflects the sector's contribution to the national GVA. Statement 2 highlights the shift in the contribution of crop production relative to other allied sectors. Statement 3 points to the lower mechanization rate compared to global benchmarks, illustrating a key technological gap. Statement 4 indicates the limited investment in agricultural research and development. Finally, Statement 5 underscores the vulnerability of a significant portion of Indian agriculture to rainfall variability.  Therefore, all statements are correct and reflect challenges in the sector.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correct statements.



**2. Consider the following features of  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS):**

1.  They function at the grassroots level of the short-term cooperative credit structure.
2.  They are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by State Registrars of Cooperative Societies.
3.  They are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
4.  District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS.
5. A village can have multiple PACS.

Which of the above statements accurately describe PACS?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. PACS are indeed the foundational units of the short-term cooperative credit system in rural India (1). Their registration and administration fall under the purview of state cooperative societies acts (2). DCCBs are vital in channeling funds to PACS (4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect as PACS are not directly regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; a village typically has only one PACS.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, making (a) the correct option.



**3. Consider the following regarding the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1.  MSP is the minimum price at which the government purchases crops from farmers.
2.  MSP is aimed at preventing distress sales by farmers.
3.  The MSP covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops.
4. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, and the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
5. Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole nodal agency for procuring all MSP crops.

How many of the above statements about MSP are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. MSP acts as a safety net for farmers, preventing distress sales at lower prices (1, 2). The scheme covers a range of crops as mentioned (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect; the final decision on MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not solely the Ministry of Agriculture. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while FCI is a major procuring agency, it's not the sole agency for all MSP crops; other agencies also participate in procurement. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) are entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  The RBI's total expenditure is approximately one-seventh of its total net interest income.
2.  Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of RBI profits to the central government.
3.  The Malegam Committee (2013) recommended increased surplus transfers from the RBI to the government.
4.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, determines surplus transfer based solely on realized equity.
5. The RBI's Ways and Means Advances (WMA) scheme provides financial assistance to States/UTs to bridge temporary cash flow mismatches.


How many of the above statements concerning the RBI are accurate?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The RBI generates a significant surplus due to the disparity between its income and expenditure (1).  The RBI Act mandates profit transfers to the government (2).  The Malegam Committee's recommendations influenced increased surplus transfers (3). The WMA scheme is a key RBI facility for state governments (5). However, statement 4 is incorrect; the ECF considers both realized equity and economic capital (CGRA) in determining surplus transfers, not just realized equity. Therefore, four out of the five statements are accurate.



**5. Consider the following concerning Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank, established in 1974, was India's first MFI.
2.  Microfinance loans are defined as collateral-free loans to low-income households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
3.  MFIs typically charge higher interest rates compared to commercial banks.
4.  The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs operating in India.
5.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's microfinance sector?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. SEWA Bank holds the distinction of being India's pioneering MFI (1).  MFIs generally charge higher interest rates (3), and the RBI regulates them (4). PMMY offers loans as described (5). However, statement 2 is incorrect; the annual income limit for microfinance loans is *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are entirely accurate.



**6. Consider the following regarding the Indian financial inclusion index:**

1. The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100.
2.  The FI-Index incorporates data from banking, investments, insurance, postal services, and the pension sector.
3.  An FI-Index score of 0 indicates complete financial inclusion, while 100 indicates complete exclusion.
4. The FI-Index is published annually in July.
5. The FI-Index includes three parameters: Access, Usage, and Quality, with Usage having the highest weightage.

How many of the statements above are correct about the Indian FI-Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The FI-Index uses a 0-100 scale (1), includes data from multiple sectors (2), is published annually in July (4), and comprises Access, Usage, and Quality (5).  Statement 3 is incorrect; 0 represents complete *exclusion*, and 100 represents complete *inclusion*.  Therefore, four out of five statements are accurate.



**7. Consider the following statements concerning Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India:**

1.  Priority Sector Lending aims to ensure credit access for vulnerable sections and underdeveloped areas.
2.  PSL was formalized in 1972.
3.  The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework for districts with high credit flow.
4.  All bank loans to MSMEs qualify for classification under PSL.
5.  PSL Certificates (PSLCs) are non-tradable instruments used to meet PSL targets.

How many of the statements above accurately describe aspects of PSL?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. PSL's objective is to reach underserved sectors (1), it was formalized in 1972 (2), and MSME loans are included in PSL (4). However, statement 3 is incorrect; the revised norms incentivize districts with *low* credit flow, not high. Statement 5 is also incorrect; PSLCs are indeed tradable instruments. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India:**

1.  The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework applies to all UCBs, regardless of tier or size.
2.  The PCA framework aims to enhance the precision and flexibility of addressing UCB financial health.
3.  Capital, asset quality, and profitability are key monitoring areas under the PCA framework.
4.  UCBs can exit the PCA framework if they maintain compliance for four consecutive quarters.
5.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) acts as a regulatory body for UCBs.


How many of the above statements about UCBs and the PCA framework are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The PCA framework prioritizes precision and flexibility (2), focuses on capital, asset quality, and profitability (3), and allows exit after four consecutive quarters of compliance (4). However, statement 1 is incorrect; the PCA framework has exceptions, like UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). Statement 5 is also incorrect; NUCFDC is an umbrella organization, not a regulatory body. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the Indian Jute sector:**

1.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) was established in 1971 as a price support agency.
2.  The JCI implements the Jute I-CARE project, focusing on mechanization and improved retting techniques.
3.  The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging.
4.  Jute production in India has consistently increased year-on-year since the enactment of the 1987 Act.
5.  The JCI is primarily responsible for regulating the quality and export of jute products.

How many of the statements above correctly describe aspects of India's jute sector?


(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The JCI's establishment and its role (1), the I-CARE project's focus (2), and the 1987 Act's mandate (3) are accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect; jute production trends aren't consistently upward since the Act's implementation. Statement 5 is also incorrect; JCI's role isn't primarily focused on quality regulation and exports.  Other organizations also play those roles.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following concerning the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS):**

1.  NAFIS offers a comprehensive overview of rural livelihoods and financial inclusion.
2.  NAFIS was launched in 2016-17.
3.  The NAFIS data is used to calculate the NAFINDEX, a measure of financial inclusion.
4.  NAFIS primarily focuses on the banking sector's reach in rural areas.
5.  The second NAFIS survey provided insights into rural development since 2016-17.

How many of the above statements accurately describe NAFIS?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correct. NAFIS provides a broad overview of rural financial inclusion (1), was launched in 2016-17 (2),  its data informs NAFINDEX (3), and the second survey provided insights since 2016-17 (5). However, statement 4 is incorrect; NAFIS’s scope extends beyond just banking, encompassing various financial services.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, led to the formation of the WTO in 1995, replacing GATT.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)
2.  The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
3.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)
4.  The Bretton Woods Conference

How many of the above are directly involved in facilitating financial assistance or development funding for nations or regions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The EIF (Enhanced Integrated Framework) is a multilateral partnership assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to use trade for growth and poverty reduction.  The DBN (Digital Bharat Nidhi) funds telecom schemes in underserved areas of India. The Bretton Woods Conference led to the creation of the IMF and World Bank, key institutions providing financial assistance globally.  Therefore, the EIF, DBN, and the outcomes of the Bretton Woods Conference are all directly involved in providing financial aid or development funding. The USOF (Universal Service Obligation Fund), while a funding mechanism, was specifically for Indian telecom infrastructure and has been replaced by the DBN. Thus, only three are directly involved in broader financial assistance.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The National CoE for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR)
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)

4.  The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP)

How many of the above entities are primarily involved in regulating or promoting aspects of the financial sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) regulates the securities market in India. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) is the central bank, overseeing monetary policy and banking regulation. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform facilitates guarantees for infrastructure projects, influencing the financial landscape. The NCoE for AVGC-XR, while important for economic growth, focuses on a specific technological sector and isn't primarily a financial regulator. Therefore, three of the listed entities are directly involved in regulating or promoting aspects of the financial sector.


**3. Consider the following statements related to international financial mechanisms:**

1.  The IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) provides concessional loans with market-based interest rates.
2.  The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform aims to reduce annual guarantee issuance.
3.  Project Nexus aims to facilitate instant cross-border retail payments.
4.  The General Resources Account (GRA) of the IMF offers concessional financing to low-income countries.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the function or goal of the mentioned international financial mechanism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 accurately describes Project Nexus's goal.  The PRGT (Statement 1) offers concessional loans at *zero* interest rates, not market-based rates. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform aims to *increase*, not reduce, guarantee issuance (Statement 2).  The GRA (Statement 4) provides financing on non-concessional terms (market-based interest rates), not concessional terms for low-income countries.  Therefore, only two statements correctly describe the mentioned international financial mechanisms.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The  Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS
2.  The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS
3.  Duty Drawback
4.  Windfall Tax

How many of the above are mechanisms related to international tax policies or revenue generation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Multilateral Convention and the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS are both international initiatives designed to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).  Duty Drawback is a mechanism to rebate customs duties on imported materials used in export goods, indirectly impacting government revenue. Windfall tax is levied on industries with unusually high profits, directly impacting government revenue.  Therefore, three of the listed items are directly related to international tax policies or revenue generation.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)
2.  The B-Ready Index
3.  Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings
4.  National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP)

How many of the above are directly related to measuring or promoting aspects of a nation's business environment or industrial development?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

GFCF (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) is a key indicator of investment and economic growth, reflecting the business environment.  The B-Ready Index assesses the business and investment climate. The EoDB rankings (though discontinued), previously served a similar purpose. The NICDP actively promotes industrial development through the creation of industrial corridors.  All four items are directly related to measuring or promoting aspects of a nation's business environment or industrial development.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs)
2.  The National Land Monetization Corporation
3.  The National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (NICDC)
4.  The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID)

How many of the above are Indian entities primarily focused on infrastructure development or finance related to it?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Land Monetization Corporation focuses on monetizing surplus land for infrastructure projects. The NICDC implements projects under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme. NaBFID provides long-term financing for infrastructure.  While IIMs contribute to human capital development, which indirectly supports infrastructure development, their primary function is education and management training.  Therefore, three of the listed entities are primarily focused on infrastructure development or finance related to it.


**7. Consider the following concerning the Indian insurance sector:**

1.  Insurance penetration
2.  Insurance density
3.  Designated Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs)

Insurance penetration and density are key metrics measuring the growth of the insurance sector. D-SIIs represent a regulatory aspect aimed at stability and oversight within the sector. IRDAI's 'Insurance for All' initiative is a direct policy aimed at expanding insurance coverage.  Therefore, all four items are directly related to the growth, regulation, or expansion of the Indian insurance sector.


**8. Consider the following related to e-commerce in India:**

1.  Inventory-based e-commerce model
2.  Marketplace-based e-commerce model
3.  Open Network for Digital Commerce

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The inventory-based and marketplace-based models represent the structural aspects of e-commerce. The Open Network for Digital Commerce is a promotional initiative. The Draft e-Commerce Policy aims to regulate and improve the e-commerce environment. Therefore, all four items are directly related to the structure, regulation, or promotion of the e-commerce sector in India.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement
2.  The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement
3.  The International Intellectual Property (IP) Index
4.  The Global Innovation Index (GII)

How many of the above are related to intellectual property rights, innovation, or their measurement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS Agreement is an international treaty governing intellectual property rights. The Doha Declaration clarifies aspects of the TRIPS Agreement related to public health. The International IP Index and the Global Innovation Index both measure aspects of intellectual property and innovation, respectively.  Therefore, all four items are related to intellectual property rights, innovation, or their measurement.


**10. Consider the following statements about the International Monetary Fund (IMF):**

1.  The IMF lends for specific projects like development banks.
2.  The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) assists countries with serious payment imbalances.
3.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) provides short-term financing to high-income countries.
4.  The "Gold Tranche" refers to a credit system granted by the IMF to its members.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect aspects of the IMF's functions or lending instruments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly describes the EFF's purpose. Statement 4 correctly describes the "Gold Tranche."  Statement 1 is incorrect; the IMF doesn't lend for specific projects like development banks. Statement 3 is incorrect; the RST provides longer-term financing, and it targets low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, not high-income countries.  Therefore, three statements correctly reflect aspects of the IMF's functions or lending instruments.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a strong understanding of the details presented.

**1. Consider the following features related to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF):**

1.  A multilateral partnership exclusively focused on aiding Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
2.  Utilizes trade as a primary tool for fostering growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction in LDCs.
3.  Supported by a significant number of partner countries and prominent international organizations.
4.  Managed by a specialized UN agency responsible for project services.
5.  Includes financial support from Finland for projects benefiting LDCs.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the EIF?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five statements accurately reflect aspects of the Enhanced Integrated Framework.  The EIF's singular focus on LDCs and its use of trade as a development engine are core tenets. Its structure involves a large partnership of countries and international organizations like the World Bank and WTO, and it is explicitly managed by the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS). The news item explicitly mentions Finland's support for EIF-funded projects in LDCs.  Therefore, all statements are correct. There are no misleading or incorrect facts presented as distractors, making this a challenging question that requires complete knowledge of the EIF's features.


**2. Consider the following statements concerning the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN):**

1.  It succeeded the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) established under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885.
2.  It is funded through a levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees.
3.  Its primary objective is to finance telecom projects in underserved areas at affordable rates.
4.  It's administered under the purview of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) as per the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
5.  The DBN is a non-lapsable fund, meaning unspent funds carry over to subsequent years.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of the DBN?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are directly supported by the text. The DBN replaced the USOF, aims to improve telecom access in underserved areas, and is managed by the DoT under the new Telecommunications Act. Statement 2 is partially true; while the USOF was funded by a levy, the text doesn't explicitly state if the DBN uses the same mechanism.  Statement 5 is false; the text doesn't indicate whether the DBN is a non-lapsable fund unlike the USOF. Therefore, only four statements are definitively correct, making this question difficult due to the partially true and false statements.


**3. Consider the following regarding the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR):**

1. It was established in response to budget announcements from 2022-23.

3. It aims to foster growth within the Indian AVGC-XR sector.
4. It operates under the provisional name of the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).
5.  It is directly funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).


How many of the above correctly describe the AVGC-XR NCoE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all correct based on the provided text.  The NCoE's establishment followed budget proposals, its legal structure, its sector focus, and its provisional name are all accurately stated. However, statement 5 is incorrect; the text makes no mention of funding through the USOF.  The question tests knowledge of the NCoE's characteristics and includes a plausible distractor related to funding, making it a challenging question.


**4. Consider the following about the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1. It's registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  It functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for urban cooperative banks (UCBs).
3.  It provides liquidity and capital support to UCBs, aiming to raise significant capital.
4. It was established in response to recommendations from an RBI working group in 2010.
5. It offers consultancy services and technological support to UCBs.

How many of the statements above accurately describe the NUCFDC?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 accurately describe the NUCFDC's role and functions.  The text clearly states its NBFC-ND status, its SRO function, its capital-raising goals and support for UCBs, and its provision of consultancy and technological assistance. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the RBI working group's recommendation was made earlier, in 2006 (with a model suggested in 2009).  The inclusion of this slightly inaccurate statement increases the difficulty level.



**5. Consider the following aspects of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):**

1. It aims to improve the financial health of UCBs with increased precision and flexibility.
2.  It replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF), effective from April 1, 2025.
3. It applies to all UCBs except those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
4. Key monitoring areas include capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.
5.  UCBs exit PCA upon showing improvement in only one of the key monitoring areas for four consecutive quarters.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the new PCA framework?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the key features of the new PCA framework. The framework's objectives, implementation date, applicability, and key monitoring areas are correctly described. However, statement 5 is incorrect;  exit from PCA requires consistent improvement across all key areas for four consecutive quarters, not just one. The inclusion of this false statement adds to the question's difficulty.


**6. Consider the following statements related to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank is considered India's first MFI.
2.  MFIs primarily provide small-value collateral-free loans to low-income individuals.
3.  RBI regulations classify loans up to ₹3,00,000 to low-income households as microfinance loans.
4.  MFIs typically charge higher interest rates than commercial banks.
5.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively funds MFIs.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the microfinance sector in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. SEWA Bank's pioneering role, the target clientele of MFIs, the RBI's loan classification, and the higher interest rates charged are all correct.  However, statement 5 is false; PMMY funds various entities, including commercial banks and NBFCs, not just MFIs.  The incorrect statement increases the difficulty.


**7. Consider the following regarding the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP):**

1.  It aims to significantly increase the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance.
2.  It consolidates guarantee products and expertise from various World Bank institutions.
3.  It focuses exclusively on providing guarantees for projects in developing countries.
4. It offers credit guarantees, trade finance guarantees, and political risk insurance.
5. It was established in 2024.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the WBG-GP?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are accurate. The platform's goal, its consolidation of resources, its range of guarantee types, and its launch year are all correctly stated.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the World Bank focuses heavily on developing countries, the guarantee platform isn't limited to them exclusively.  The inclusion of this partially true statement increases the complexity.


**8. Consider the following about Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India:**

1.  They are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds.
2.  They allow investors to participate in infrastructure projects.
3.  Sponsors are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
4.  InvITs primarily earn income through dividends from their investments.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of InvITs?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly characterize InvITs. Their structure, investment focus, and borrower status under SARFAESI are accurately described. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while dividends are a source of income, InvITs can earn through tolls, rents, and interest as well. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the amendments allow subordinate units only for privately placed InvITs.  The presence of two incorrect statements makes this a challenging question.


**9.  Consider the following concerning Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:**

1.  Seven CRAs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also regulates certain aspects of CRAs.
3.  All registered CRAs are accredited by RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
4.  SEBI regulations mandate disclosure of rating criteria and conflict-of-interest guidelines.
5.  The IRDA and PFRDA also have regulatory oversight over some aspects of CRAs.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulatory landscape of CRAs in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The number of SEBI-registered CRAs, the RBI's role, the mandatory disclosures under SEBI regulations, and the involvement of IRDA and PFRDA are all accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect; not all registered CRAs are accredited by the RBI.  This makes the question more difficult.



**10. Consider the following regarding  India’s gold market:**

1. India is the world's second-largest gold consumer.
2.  Switzerland, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates are leading gold exporters.
3.  Bihar possesses the largest gold reserves in India.
4. The World Gold Council (WGC) provides analysis and research on the gold market.
5. China is a leading gold importer.


How many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of India's gold market or the global gold trade?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. India's consumer status, the leading exporters, the WGC's role, and China's import position are all accurately represented. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while Bihar has significant reserves, the text indicates that the largest reserves are located in Bihar (44%), followed by Rajasthan (25%) and Karnataka (21%). The presence of this partially correct statement enhances the question's difficulty.


These questions comprehensively cover the target content, demanding detailed factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related information.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes them challenging and suitable for a UPSC-level examination.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. The HDR is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  The Human Development Index (HDI) is a core component of the HDR.
3. The HDR primarily focuses on economic growth indicators.
4. The HDR was first published in 1990.
5. Mahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani economist, played a significant role in the development of the HDI.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  Statement 2 is correct; the HDI is indeed a central component of the HDR. Statement 3 is incorrect. While economic factors are considered, the HDR examines a broader range of factors affecting human development, including health, education, and environmental sustainability. Statement 4 is correct; the HDR's first publication was in 1990. Statement 5 is also correct; Mahbub ul Haq was instrumental in developing the HDI. Therefore, only statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct.


**2. Consider the following indices used by the UNDP to measure human development:**

1. Gender Inequality Index (GII)
2. Gender Development Index (GDI)
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)
4. Planetary Pressures-adjusted Human Development Index
5. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)

How many of the above indices specifically measure aspects of gender inequality or disparity?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GII, GDI, and Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI are all indices focusing on different aspects of human development.  The GII directly measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market. The GDI measures disparities in HDI achievements between men and women.  The Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI considers environmental sustainability alongside traditional HDI factors, indirectly impacting gender equality due to its effects on resource access.  The MPI measures multidimensional poverty, which can disproportionately affect women, but it is not exclusively a gender-focused index.  Therefore, only two indices (GII and GDI) explicitly measure gender inequality or disparity.


**3. Consider the following statements related to India's agricultural sector:**

1. KISAN uses artificial intelligence for crop yield estimation.

(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics, which can include AI components, but it's not its sole focus. Statement 2 is incorrect; ADeX focuses on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data. Statement 3 is correct; ICCC uses remote sensing and other technologies. Statement 4 is incorrect; the MSP is recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices and finalized by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. Statement 5 is correct; the 2018 policy had that ambitious target, although it was not met.  Therefore, only three statements are factually accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's agricultural exports:**

How many of these statements accurately reflect the state of India's agricultural exports and related policies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while rice is a significant export, marine products often exceed it in value. Statement 2 is correct; vegetable oil is a major import for India. Statement 3 is incorrect; India's share is less than 5%. Statement 4 is incorrect; TIES supports various infrastructure projects related to exports, not just ports. Statement 5 is correct; MAI focuses on specific products and markets.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately describe NBFCs and related regulatory aspects?

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits. Statement 2 is incorrect; they are not part of the payment system. Statement 3 is incorrect; DICGC does not cover NBFC deposits. Statement 4 is incorrect; State Governments regulate Chit Funds. Statement 5 is correct; the Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates Nidhi Companies. Therefore, only one statement is accurate.

Statement 1 is correct; this is a stated goal of India's logistics sector development. Statement 2 is incorrect; the LPI considers multiple parameters, not only infrastructure. Statement 3 is incorrect; NLP 2022 addresses both soft and hard infrastructure. Statement 4 is correct; MMLPs are a key component of NLP 2022. Statement 5 is incorrect; India's 2023 ranking was above the 50th position.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**7.  Consider the following statements about the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI):**

1. IRDAI regulates both public and private sector banks.
2.  Insurance penetration in India has consistently remained below 2% for the past two decades.
3.  IRDAI aims for "Insurance for All" by 2047.
4.  IRDAI designates Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs).
5.  Insurance density in India is significantly lower than the global average.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the role and impact of IRDAI in the Indian insurance sector?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; IRDAI regulates insurance companies, not banks. Statement 2 is incorrect; insurance penetration has increased significantly. Statement 3 is correct; this is a stated goal. Statement 4 is correct; IRDAI identifies D-SIIs. Statement 5 is likely correct; India's insurance density is relatively low compared to many developed nations, although precise global averages vary. Therefore, four statements are largely accurate.  While statement 5 requires further verification depending on the specific global average used, based on general knowledge it is more accurate than inaccurate.



**8. Consider the following regarding the World Bank's Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index:**

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics and adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)
2.  Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)
3.  India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF)
4.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in the PPP sector

How many of the above are government initiatives aimed at boosting infrastructure development in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four options represent distinct but interconnected government initiatives designed to stimulate infrastructure development.  The NMP aims to unlock value from existing government assets, attracting private investment. The VGF provides financial support to enhance project viability, mitigating risks for private investors. The IIPDF provides funding support to project sponsors, facilitating the development of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).  The FDI policy in the PPP sector further encourages private participation by allowing significant foreign investment. Therefore, all four are crucial components of India's infrastructure development strategy.  There is no single initiative that stands out as the sole driver of infrastructure development; rather, they work synergistically.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding asset monetization in India:**

1.  The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended asset monetization in 2012.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).
3.  Asset monetization primarily involves the outright sale of government assets to private entities.
4.  The top five sectors targeted under the NMP account for approximately 83% of the aggregate pipeline.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation in 2012 laid the groundwork for the later adoption of asset monetization as a key policy.  Statement 2 is also correct: The NMP explicitly aims for ₹6.0 lakh crore in monetization over the specified period. Statement 3 is incorrect: Asset monetization does *not* primarily involve outright sales; it focuses on long-term leases or licenses, allowing the government to retain some control while generating revenue. Statement 4 is correct:  The text explicitly states that the top five sectors (Roads, Railways, Power, Oil & Gas pipelines, and Telecom) account for approximately 83% of the NMP pipeline.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The SpaceTech Innovation Network does facilitate public-private partnerships. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) does indeed have a space challenge for students. The Ministry of Finance does oversee FDI rules in the space sector under FEMA, 1999. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While 100% FDI is allowed in many areas, it's not universally true across all space sector activities; the route (automatic or government) varies depending on the specific activity.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following in relation to the Voluntary Vehicle Modernization Program (VVMP):**

1. The VVMP aims to create a circular economy in the automotive sector.
2.  The program involves offering discounts against a Scrappage Certificate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The VVMP explicitly aims to create a circular economy by promoting recycling and reducing raw material consumption. Statement 2 is also correct: The program incentivizes vehicle scrapping by offering discounts in exchange for a Scrappage Certificate.  Statement 3 is incorrect: The program was announced earlier, in 2021. Statement 4 is incorrect: The VVMP targets both commercial and passenger vehicles.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the VVMP.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Food Corporation of India (FCI):**

1.  The FCI is a public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution.
2.  The FCI was established in 1964 to address grain shortages.
3.  States can purchase rice from FCI under OMSS (Open Market Sale Scheme) Domestic without e-auction participation from August 1, 2024.
4.  The Anna Darpan System is designed to modernize the FCI's supply chain management.

Which of the above statements are accurate concerning the FCI?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The FCI is indeed under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution.  The  OMSS Domestic scheme allows states to procure rice without e-auctions from August 1, 2024, as stated. The Anna Darpan System is designed to modernize the FCI's supply chain. However, Statement 2 is slightly inaccurate; while the FCI aimed to address grain shortages, it was established in 1965, not 1964, under the Food Corporation Act of 1964. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are completely accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding investment in startups:**

1.  Venture capitalists typically invest in startups at earlier, riskier stages.
2.  Angel investors invest pooled institutional funds in startups with proven market traction.

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Venture capitalists typically focus on later-stage investments with proven traction, while angel investors usually invest at earlier, riskier stages (making statement 2 incorrect). The MAARG portal does provide mentorship and support, and the FFS Scheme is a Startup India initiative. Therefore, the correct answer is (a).



**8. Consider the following regarding the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

3.  India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty in the 2024 MPI report.
4.  The MPI measures poverty solely based on income levels.

Which of the above statements are correct about the MPI?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The 2024 MPI report did indicate approximately 1.1 billion people in acute multidimensional poverty, and India did have the largest number of people in extreme poverty. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the MPI is released jointly by the UNDP and OPHI, not the World Bank. Statement 4 is incorrect; the MPI uses a multidimensional approach, considering factors beyond just income.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. A substantial portion of oilseed cultivation is indeed rainfed. Groundnut production is concentrated in certain states. PM-AASHA does aim to ensure MSP for oilseed farmers. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm aims to *expand*, not reduce, oil palm cultivation.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding millet production in India:**

1. India accounts for a significant portion of global millet production.
2.  Millet production has steadily increased in recent years.
3.  Labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer contribute to a yield gap in millet production.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. India does account for a significant portion of global millet production. Labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer are indeed factors contributing to a yield gap. However, Statement 2 is incorrect; millet production has stagnated, not increased.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; millets have a relatively *short* shelf life, posing storage challenges.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the situation.


**11. Consider the following regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. The HDR is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2.  The Human Development Index (HDI) is the core of the HDR.

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The HDR is released annually by UNDP. The HDI is indeed its core component. The IHDI does measure inequality in human development achievements.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the GII measures gender inequalities in *three* dimensions (reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market). Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**12. Consider the following regarding India's fisheries sector:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) aims to improve fish production and productivity.
2.  The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) focuses solely on marine fisheries.
3.  Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) are an environmentally unfriendly aquaculture technique.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. PMMSY does aim to improve fish production and productivity. The Rangeen Machhli app does provide information on ornamental fish. However, Statement 2 is incorrect; FIDF covers both marine and inland fisheries. Statement 3 is incorrect; RAS is an environmentally *friendly* technique. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.


**13. Consider the following regarding taxation:**

1.  A windfall tax is imposed on industries experiencing unusually high profits.
2.  The objective of a windfall tax is to redistribute excess profits for social good.
3.  Governments justify windfall taxes by arguing that profits are solely due to the taxed entity's efforts.
4.  Angel tax was abolished in Budget 2024-25 for all classes of investors.

Which of the above statements accurately describe windfall tax and angel tax?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Windfall taxes are indeed imposed on industries with exceptionally high profits, and their purpose is to redistribute those profits for the broader social good. Angel tax was abolished for all investor classes in Budget 2024-25. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; governments justify windfall taxes by arguing that the profits are partly due to external factors, not solely the entity's efforts. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**14. Consider the following regarding Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI):**

1.  DPI should be secure and interoperable.
2.  Connectivity infrastructure is considered a part of DPI.
3.  India Stack is an example of India's foundational DPI.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. DPI should be secure and interoperable. India Stack is a prime example of India's foundational DPI. However, Statement 2 is incorrect; connectivity infrastructure is *complementary* to DPI, not a part of it. Statement 4 is incorrect; simply digitizing existing processes does not constitute DPI. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulatory body for MFIs.
2.  All collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000 are classified as microfinance loans.
3.  MFIs typically charge higher interest rates compared to commercial banks.
4.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides loans to MFIs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs in India, setting guidelines and overseeing their operations. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The definition of a microfinance loan by the RBI specifies an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  Statement 3 is correct. MFIs often cater to a higher-risk clientele with limited access to formal banking, necessitating higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk. Statement 4 is incorrect. While PMMY provides loans to small and micro enterprises, it doesn't exclusively lend to MFIs; commercial banks and other Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are also involved in loan disbursement under PMMY. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following features related to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY):**

1.  It provides loans up to ₹20 lakh under the ‘Tarun Plus’ category.
2.  Loans under PMMY are categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun.
3.  PMMY exclusively provides loans to corporate entities.
4.  The 2024 Union Budget reduced the loan limit for the Tarun category.

Which of the above statements regarding PMMY are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget increased the loan limit under PMMY to ₹20 lakh for the ‘Tarun Plus’ category, specifically for those who had previously availed and successfully repaid loans under the Tarun category. Statement 2 is correct.  The PMMY categorizes loans into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun based on the loan amount and the stage of business development. Statement 3 is incorrect. PMMY specifically targets non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. Statement 4 is incorrect; the budget *increased* the loan limit, not reduced it.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):**

1.  NaBFID is a Public Financial Institution (PFI) notified under the Companies Act, 2013.

3.  NaBFID's primary objective is to provide short-term, high-risk infrastructure financing.
4.  To be classified as a PFI, an institution must have at least 75% of its paid-up share capital held by the central or state government.

How many of the above statements accurately describe NaBFID?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Central Government officially designated NaBFID as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013. Statement 2 is correct. NaBFID's establishment is legally defined by the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021. Statement 3 is incorrect. NaBFID focuses on *long-term*, non-recourse infrastructure financing, aiming for stability and sustainable development, not short-term high-risk ventures. Statement 4 is incorrect. The threshold for PFI classification requires at least 51%, not 75%, of paid-up share capital held by the central or state government.  Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the  Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):**

1.  RRSK was launched in 2017-18 with a fund allocation of ₹1 lakh crore for a 5-year period.

3.  The funds from RRSK are managed solely by private sector companies.
4.  RRSK aims to improve critical railway safety infrastructure.

Which of these statements correctly describe the RRSK?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. RRSK was indeed launched in 2017-18 with a ₹1 lakh crore allocation over five years. Statement 2 is incorrect. RRSK's primary focus is on enhancing safety infrastructure, not passenger amenities. Statement 3 is incorrect. While private sector participation might be involved in project implementation, the RRSK fund is managed by the Indian Railways. Statement 4 is correct. The core objective of RRSK is the upgrading of critical railway safety infrastructure to minimize accidents. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the RRSK's features.


**5. Consider the following about the  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN):**

1.  It was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023.
2.  DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
3.  DBN funds are primarily used for high-speed internet infrastructure in urban areas.
4.  USOF generated funds through a levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.

Which statements accurately describe DBN and its predecessor?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, formally established the DBN. Statement 2 is correct. DBN replaced USOF as the primary funding mechanism for telecom schemes. Statement 3 is incorrect. DBN focuses on funding telecom schemes in underserved, remote, and rural areas, not primarily urban areas. Statement 4 is correct. USOF collected funds via a levy (5%) on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of DoT licensees.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions.


**6. Consider the following concerning the  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1.  The 2024 MPI report was jointly published by UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).
2.  The MPI measures poverty solely based on financial income levels.
3.  The MPI report indicates that approximately 1.1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty.
4.  India had the highest number of people living in extreme poverty according to the 2024 MPI report.

Which statements correctly reflect the key findings and aspects of the Global MPI?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 MPI report was a collaborative effort between UNDP and OPHI. Statement 2 is incorrect. The MPI considers multiple dimensions of poverty, including education, health, and living standards, not just financial income. Statement 3 is correct. The report estimated that around 1.1 billion individuals globally experience acute multidimensional poverty. Statement 4 is correct.  India reported the largest number of people in extreme poverty according to the 2024 MPI report. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately represent the MPI's findings.


**7. Consider the following about the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s concerns regarding banks:**

1.  The RBI expressed concern over the high Credit-Deposit (CD) ratio of banks.
2.  A high CD ratio indicates that a large proportion of a bank's resources are allocated to loans.
3.  The RBI recommended that banks should increase their CD ratio to stimulate economic growth.
4.  The CD ratio peaked at 78.8% in December 2023, the highest since 2005.


Which statements accurately reflect RBI's concerns and observations on bank CD ratios?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI has indeed voiced concerns about the elevated CD ratios of several banks. Statement 2 is correct. A high CD ratio signifies a substantial portion of bank funds being channeled into loans. Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI's concern stems from the *risk* associated with a high CD ratio; while it can stimulate growth, it also increases the chance of liquidity problems.  Statement 4 is correct. The December 2023 CD ratio reached 78.8%, a peak not seen since 2005.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the RBI's position.

4.  DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.

Which of the above statements accurately describe India's logistics infrastructure projects?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The government's plan includes the development of 35 MMLPs to improve logistics efficiency. Statement 2 is correct.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a large-scale highway development project. Statement 3 is incorrect. DFCs aim to *increase*, not reduce, the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport. Statement 4 is correct. DFCCIL was indeed incorporated in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act, 1956 (though the act was later amended). Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe the logistics initiatives.


**9. Consider the following concerning the  Jute Corporation of India (JCI):**

1.  JCI was established in 1971 as a price support agency for jute.

3.  The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandates the use of plastic packaging materials.
4.  JCI's primary function is to regulate the export of jute products.


Which of the above statements accurately describe JCI and its activities?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. JCI was established in 1971 to provide price support to jute farmers. Statement 2 is correct. The Jute I-CARE project is a key initiative of JCI aimed at improving jute cultivation and processing. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, actually mandates the *compulsory use of jute* packaging material, not plastic. Statement 4 is incorrect. JCI's primary role is not export regulation; it focuses on domestic price support and promotion of jute.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe JCI's functions.


**10. Consider the following about the  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS):**

1.  NAFIS was launched in 2016-17.
2.  NAFIS primarily focuses on urban financial inclusion.

Which of the above statements correctly characterize the NAFIS survey?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAFIS was indeed launched in 2016-17. Statement 2 is incorrect. NAFIS specifically targets rural areas, assessing rural livelihoods and financial inclusion. Statement 3 is correct. NAFIS offers a broad assessment of various aspects of rural financial inclusion. Statement 4 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Seaweed farming falls under aquaculture, and the text explicitly states aquaculture's contribution to India's GDP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The target year mentioned in the text is 2025, not 2030.  This is a crucial detail that differentiates the correct answer from the distractors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions offshore cultivation in the Andaman region, not Gujarat.  This subtle geographical difference is a key distractor.

Statement 4 is correct. The establishment of a GIS-based portal for mapping seaweed cultivation sites is accurately reflected in the provided text.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct, making (b) the correct option.  The incorrect statements use factual information but alter key details to create plausible yet wrong choices.


**2. Consider the following concerning India's silk production:**

1. India is the world's largest silk producer, accounting for over 50% of global production.
2. Karnataka contributes the highest share to India's total silk production, exceeding 40%.
3. India produces all four major varieties of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.
4.  Andhra Pradesh is the second-largest contributor to India's silk production after Karnataka.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India is the *second* largest silk producer, not the largest, with a 42% share of global production. This is a significant numerical difference designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka is a major producer, the text indicates its contribution is around 32%, not exceeding 40%. The slight difference in percentages is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that India produces all four varieties of silk mentioned.

Statement 4 is correct. Andhra Pradesh is identified as the second-largest contributor after Karnataka.

Thus, only statements 3 and 4 are correct, making (b) the right answer. The incorrect options cleverly manipulate precise figures and rankings to test detailed knowledge.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY):**

1. PMMSY aims to enhance fish production and productivity through infrastructure development and value chain strengthening.
2.  The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) is a separate scheme unrelated to PMMSY.
3. PMMSY includes the development of Integrated Aquaparks using advanced technologies like RAS and Biofloc.
4. The "Rangeen Machhli" app is a multilingual resource created under PMMSY, providing information on ornamental fish.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) All three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PMMSY's broad objectives, as described in the text, directly address enhancing fish production and strengthening value chains.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  FIDF is mentioned in the context of PMMSY, indicating it's a related initiative or component, not a separate, unrelated scheme.  This is a key point of confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly links Integrated Aquaparks and the use of RAS and Biofloc technologies to PMMSY.

Statement 4 is correct. The "Rangeen Machhli" app is clearly mentioned as a component of PMMSY.

Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct, resulting in (c) being the right answer. The incorrect statement subtly twists the relationship between PMMSY and FIDF to create a challenging distractor.


**4. Consider the following statements about initiatives related to India's agricultural sector:**

1. The KISAN initiative uses space technology and geoinformatics to improve crop yield estimation.
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a platform primarily focused on providing market information to farmers.
3. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) employs AI and remote sensing for decision-making in agriculture.
4.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme covers only Kharif crops.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions KISAN's use of space technology and geoinformatics for yield estimation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While ADeX deals with farmer data, its primary focus is not market information; it also includes farmer identity and geotagged farm locations. This subtle difference in focus is a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The description of ICCC aligns with the use of AI, remote sensing, and GIS for agricultural decision-making.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that MSP covers both Kharif and Rabi crops, along with some commercial crops.  This is a significant factual error designed to be a challenging distractor.

Therefore, statements 1, 3, are correct, making (c) the correct option. The incorrect statements cleverly misrepresent the precise function or scope of the initiatives.


**5. Consider the following about India's Agricultural Export Policy and related schemes:**

1. India's agricultural exports experienced a significant increase in 2023-24, exceeding the target set by the 2018 policy.
2. Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports.
3. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) focuses on upgrading existing infrastructure rather than creating new infrastructure.
4. The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme adopts a product-specific and country-specific approach.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that agricultural exports registered an *8% decline* in 2023-24, falling short of the target. This is a crucial detail for identifying the correct answer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice is a major export, the text indicates that it constitutes 21% of total exports, implying other products have a larger share.  This numerical discrepancy is a key distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  TIES is described as assisting in both setting up *and* upgrading infrastructure, not just upgrading. This subtle difference in wording is a test of careful reading.

Statement 4 is correct. The description of MAI accurately reflects its product-focus and country-focus approach.

Therefore, only statement 4 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. The incorrect statements contain elements of truth but cleverly misrepresent key facts and figures to increase the difficulty.


**6. Consider the following about the  Jute Corporation of India (JCI) and related initiatives:**

1. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) was established in 1970 primarily to regulate jute production.

(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect initiatives related to infrastructure development and investment in India.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a key government initiative to unlock value from existing assets and attract private investment. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) directly supports infrastructure projects by reducing financial risk for private investors. The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) provides crucial funding support to project sponsors, facilitating Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).  The allowance of up to 100% FDI in SPVs within the PPP sector demonstrates a commitment to attracting foreign investment. Finally, the Vijay Kelkar committee's recommendation in 2012 laid the groundwork for many of these subsequent initiatives.  Therefore, option (b) is the most appropriate answer, encompassing all relevant aspects.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more accurate statements.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the ISI mark and its related aspects?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe the ISI mark and its associated elements. The ISI mark is indeed mandatory for certain products within India, ensuring a minimum standard of quality and safety.  The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and implementing the ISI mark scheme. The mark itself serves as a guarantee of quality and safety to consumers. The Central Government utilizes Quality Control Orders (QCOs) to mandate the ISI mark for specific products.  Finally, the Hallmark, also managed by BIS, provides a parallel guarantee of purity for precious metals.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all five statements are factually accurate and relevant to the ISI mark system.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Agricultural exports in India declined in 2023-24.
2.  Rice constitutes a significant portion of India's agricultural exports.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's agricultural export sector?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 correctly describe aspects of India's agricultural export sector.  Agricultural exports did decline in 2023-24, as noted in the provided text. Rice is a major export commodity for India. Vegetable oil constitutes a significant portion of India's agricultural imports, indicating a trade imbalance in this specific area. Finally, APEDA plays a crucial role in promoting agricultural exports and managing GI registrations. Statement 4 is incorrect; India's share of global agricultural exports is relatively small (2.4% in 2022 according to the WTO), not substantial. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer, accurately reflecting the factual information related to India's agricultural exports.

2.  The MSP covers all major agricultural crops produced in India.
3.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs.
4.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is a major procuring agency for wheat and paddy.
5.  The government's target for agricultural exports has been consistently met.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the MSP system.  The MSP indeed acts as a safety net for farmers, ensuring a minimum price for their produce. The CACP is responsible for recommending MSPs, considering various production costs. The FCI is a key procuring agency for major crops like wheat and paddy. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the MSP covers a significant number of crops, it doesn't cover *all* major crops.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; the government's agricultural export targets have not been consistently met, as evidenced by the decline in 2023-24. Therefore, option (d) is correct, accurately identifying four true statements regarding India's MSP system.

5.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's infrastructure development strategy?


(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately represent key aspects of India's infrastructure development strategy. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is designed to integrate data from different ministries to improve coordination and efficiency. The initiative is indeed driven by seven engines of infrastructure (Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure). The World Bank regularly publishes reports benchmarking infrastructure development across global economies. PPPs are a cornerstone of India's infrastructure development approach, attracting private investment and expertise. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a vital role in evaluating central sector PPP projects. Therefore, option (c) is correct, as all five statements are true and relevant to India's infrastructure development framework.

2.  NBFCs are part of the payment and settlement system.
3.  Deposit insurance from DICGC is available to depositors of NBFCs.
4.  Scale-based regulation (SBR) categorizes NBFCs based on size and risk.
5.  P2P lending platforms act as intermediaries for individual lenders and borrowers.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and related regulations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 5 accurately describe NBFCs and their regulatory environment. NBFCs are indeed prohibited from accepting demand deposits, differentiating them from banks.  Scale-based regulation (SBR) is used to categorize NBFCs based on their size and risk profile. P2P lending platforms act as intermediaries, facilitating direct lending between individuals. Statement 2 is incorrect; NBFCs are *not* typically part of the payment and settlement system. Statement 3 is also incorrect; deposit insurance from DICGC does not extend to NBFCs.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as four of the five statements accurately reflect aspects of NBFCs and their regulations.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Financial Stability Report (FSR) is published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The FSR assesses the health of the Indian financial system.
3.  The SARFAESI Act allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral.
4.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) addresses corporate insolvency resolution.
5.  The National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited resolves stressed assets below ₹500 crore.

How many of the above statements accurately describe measures taken to manage Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe measures related to NPA management. The FSR, published by the RBI, provides an assessment of the financial system's stability, including NPA levels. The SARFAESI Act and the IBC are crucial legal frameworks for addressing NPAs and resolving stressed assets.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited targets stressed assets *above* ₹500 crore, not below.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, accurately identifying four true statements related to NPA management in India.

5.  Social entrepreneurship is a key theme in the Global Innovation Index 2024.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of intellectual property, innovation, and cultural heritage?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect aspects of intellectual property, innovation, and cultural heritage. The Geographical Indications Act does protect traditional knowledge and associated geographical indications. UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage is a significant factor in preserving cultural assets. The GII and the International IP Index are both important indicators of innovation and intellectual property protection. Social entrepreneurship is indeed a key theme explored in the Global Innovation Index 2024. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as all five statements are factually accurate and relevant to the broader themes of intellectual property, innovation, and cultural heritage.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the characteristics of a Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS):**

1. It operates solely for the mutual benefit of its members.
2. It must have a minimum of two hundred members.
3. It is required to maintain Net Owned Funds of at least ten lakh rupees.
4. It accepts deposits from and provides loans to non-members as well.

**How many of the above statements accurately describe a PACS?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** PACS are cooperative credit institutions that operate at the village level.  Statement 1 is correct; their primary function is to serve the financial needs of their members for mutual benefit. Statement 2 is also correct, specifying a minimum membership requirement to ensure a viable cooperative structure. Statement 3 accurately reflects the minimum capital requirement to ensure financial stability. However, statement 4 is incorrect. PACS primarily serve their members; extending services to non-members is not a core function.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe a PACS. The incorrect option (4) is a common misconception, as many financial institutions operate with a broader customer base, but PACS are specifically member-focused.


**2. Consider the following regarding the ISI Mark:**

1. It is a quality control certification developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).
2. The Central Government mandates the ISI mark for all products sold in India.
3.  The ISI mark guarantees product quality and safety for an unlimited period.
4.  Hallmarking and Eco Mark are additional standards developed and managed by BIS.

**How many of the above statements correctly describe the ISI Mark and its associated aspects?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; the ISI mark is indeed a quality and safety certification provided by the BIS. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Central Government mandates the ISI mark for *certain* products, not all.  The selection of products is based on their impact on public safety and quality. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the ISI mark indicates quality and safety at the time of certification, product quality can change over time. Therefore, it doesn't offer unlimited guarantee. Statement 4 is accurate; both Hallmark (for precious metals) and Eco Mark (for environmentally friendly products) are other BIS standards.  Thus, only three statements are accurate. The inclusion of statement 2 as a distractor is crucial, as it presents a common misunderstanding about the scope of the ISI mark mandate.


**3. Consider the following regarding "Green Shoots" in the context of India's economy:**

1.  They represent signs of economic recovery after a downturn.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) identified rural economies as the source of green shoots in the FMCG sector.
3.  Green shoots are indicators of consistent, long-term economic growth irrespective of short-term fluctuations.
4.  The FMCG sector includes products with a high turnover and short consumption cycles, such as detergents and toiletries.


**How many of the above statements correctly explain the concept of "Green Shoots" and their relevance to India's economy?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 correctly defines green shoots as early signs of economic recovery following a period of decline. Statement 2 accurately reflects the RBI's observation regarding the rural economy's role in the FMCG sector's recovery.  Statement 3 is incorrect; green shoots are specifically early indicators of recovery, not a guarantee of sustained long-term growth. Short-term factors can still influence the overall economic outlook. Statement 4 correctly describes the FMCG sector, providing examples of high-turnover, short-consumption cycle products. Therefore, three statements accurately describe the concept and its relevance. The inclusion of statement 3 serves as a critical distractor, as it plays on the idea of sustained growth, contrasting with the inherent uncertainty associated with green shoots.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's oilseed production:**

1. A significant portion (nearly 72%) of oilseed cultivation depends on rain-fed agriculture.
2. The production of specific oilseeds is concentrated in a few states, with Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka accounting for a majority of groundnut production.
3. The "Yellow Revolution" focused on boosting the production of all edible oils, including those derived from palm oil.
4.  The National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) primarily focuses on improving the distribution of oilseeds, excluding research and development.


**How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's oilseed production and related initiatives?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 correctly highlights the dependence of oilseed cultivation on rainfall, posing a challenge to consistent production.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the geographical concentration of oilseed production, particularly groundnut.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Yellow Revolution aimed to boost edible oil production, it primarily focused on mustard and sesame seeds, not palm oil. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NFSM-OS&OP encompasses seed breeding, production inputs, and technology transfer, not just distribution.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the given aspects. The inclusion of statements 3 and 4 as distractors is crucial, as they represent common misconceptions or incomplete understandings of the initiatives related to oilseed production in India.


**5. Consider the following factors contributing to stagnant millet production in India:**

1.  Yield gaps caused by labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer use.
2.  A shift in consumer preferences towards fine cereals, due to government support for those crops.
3.  The relatively short shelf life of millets, posing significant storage challenges.
4.  High production costs for millets compared to other cereals, making them less profitable for farmers.

**How many of the above factors contribute to the stagnation of millet production in India?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 correctly identifies labor shortages and fertilizer deficiencies as significant contributors to lower millet yields. Statement 2 is also correct; the shift in consumer preference, influenced by government support for fine cereals through MSP schemes, has negatively affected millet demand. Statement 3 accurately points out the storage challenges posed by the shorter shelf life of millets.  However, statement 4 is not a primary factor; while production costs are a consideration, the other factors listed have a more significant impact on the overall stagnation of millet production.  Therefore, only three of the statements are accurate contributors. The inclusion of statement 4 serves as a plausible distractor, as it touches upon a relevant aspect of agricultural economics without being a primary driver of the observed stagnation.


**6. Consider the following initiatives aimed at improving India's agricultural sector:**

1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) for yield estimation improvement.
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) providing farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data.
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) using AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making.
4.  The establishment of a nationwide network of agricultural cooperatives to ensure direct access to markets for farmers.


**How many of the above initiatives are focused on leveraging technology for improved agricultural practices and data management in India?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** KISAN, ADeX, and ICCC are all technology-driven initiatives aimed at improving various aspects of agriculture. KISAN uses space technology for better yield estimation. ADeX is a data exchange platform providing crucial information about farmers and their crops. ICCC utilizes advanced technologies for informed decision-making.  However, statement 4, while desirable for improving farmers' market access, is not a technology-focused initiative. It represents a different approach to enhancing agricultural efficiency.  Therefore, only three of the initiatives specifically leverage technology.  The inclusion of statement 4 as a distractor is essential, as it represents a related but distinct approach to agricultural improvement, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between technology-focused and non-technology-focused initiatives.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b) Only two


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Housing Bank (NHB) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and acts as the apex institution for the regulation and supervision of housing finance companies in India.  Its primary role is to promote and develop the housing finance sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Chit Fund Companies are regulated by the respective State Governments, not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.  The regulatory framework varies from state to state.

Statement 3 is correct. SEBI's regulatory powers extend to merchant bankers, who play a crucial role in the primary and secondary markets of securities.  Their activities are closely monitored to ensure fair practices and investor protection.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Nidhi Companies are regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, not the RBI.  They are a specific type of non-banking financial institution operating under the Companies Act.  The RBI's regulatory focus is primarily on banks and other financial institutions with deposit-taking capabilities.


**2. Consider the following features related to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1.  It replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  It applies to all UCBs regardless of tier classification.
3.  Capital adequacy is a key monitoring area under the PCA framework.
4.  Exit from PCA requires consistent breaches in risk thresholds across four consecutive quarters.


Which of the above statements are NOT correct?

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PCA framework is designed to supersede the SAF, introducing a more precise and flexible approach to addressing UCB financial health.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PCA framework specifically excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID) from its application, meaning not all UCBs are subject to the PCA framework.

Statement 3 is correct. Capital adequacy, along with asset quality and profitability, forms the core of the monitoring parameters under the PCA framework for UCBs.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Exit from PCA and the withdrawal of restrictions occur when *no* breaches in risk thresholds are observed across four consecutive quarterly financial statements.  Consistent breaches would trigger continued PCA measures, not an exit.


**3. Consider the following regarding Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  The RBI is the primary regulatory body for MFIs.
2.  The Malegam Committee recommended a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.
3.  All collateral-free loans to low-income households are considered microfinance loans.

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a central role in regulating and supervising microfinance institutions (MFIs) in India, ensuring their financial stability and adherence to responsible lending practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The Malegam Committee report, commissioned by the RBI, provided crucial recommendations for a regulatory framework governing NBFC-MFIs, aiming to strike a balance between promoting financial inclusion and mitigating risks associated with microfinance operations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The RBI's definition clearly states that collateral-free loans to low-income households (meeting specific income criteria) are considered microfinance loans. This is a key aspect of microfinance targeting the financially underserved.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  MFIs often charge higher interest rates compared to commercial banks due to factors such as higher operational costs, the relatively higher risk associated with lending to low-income borrowers, and the absence of robust collateral.


**4. Consider the following entities and their regulatory oversight:**

1.  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS): Regulated by the RBI.
2.  District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs): Refinanced by NABARD.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding NPAs and their management in India?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c) Only three


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 90-day overdue period is a standard criterion for classifying a loan as an NPA, reflecting a significant default in repayment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FSR is published *biannually*, not annually, by the RBI, providing a periodic assessment of the financial stability of the Indian economy.

Statement 3 is correct. The IBC, 2016, provides a legal framework for resolving stressed assets and insolvency situations, including those arising from NPAs, promoting efficient debt resolution mechanisms.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral upon default *without* necessarily initiating insolvency proceedings.  It offers a quicker route to asset recovery for lenders.

Statement 1 is correct.  DICGC provides deposit insurance coverage up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh per depositor per bank.

Statement 2 is correct. The DICGC was established under the DICGC Act, 1961, to provide a safety net for bank depositors.

Statement 3 is correct. The coverage of DICGC extends to various types of banks operating in India, including commercial banks, local area banks, and regional rural banks, even including branches of foreign banks.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  DICGC's insurance coverage is specifically for banks and not for NBFCs.  Deposits in NBFCs do not have the same level of deposit insurance protection.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Scale-Based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs:**

1.  SBR segregates NBFCs into four tiers based on their size and risk profile.
2.  Each tier of NBFC under SBR faces identical regulatory requirements.
3.  The RBI uses SBR to enhance the supervision of NBFCs.
4.  SBR is primarily based on the geographical location of NBFCs.

**Correct Answer:** (c) Only three


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  SBR categorizes NBFCs into four layers based on their size, activities, and perceived risk, tailoring regulatory scrutiny accordingly.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A core principle of SBR is *differentiated* regulation, meaning each tier of NBFC faces different regulatory requirements based on its risk profile and size.

Statement 3 is correct.  The RBI uses SBR as a tool to improve its supervisory capabilities over NBFCs, enhancing its ability to manage risks effectively.

Statement 4 is incorrect. SBR is not based on the geographical location of NBFCs; it is based on their size, activities, and risk profile, irrespective of location.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Agreement on Agriculture under the WTO:**

1.  It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round and implemented following the Marrakesh Agreement.
2.  Market Access provisions primarily focus on tariff reduction and eliminating non-tariff barriers like quotas.
3.  Domestic Support provisions address subsidies that distort trade, categorized into various "boxes" based on subsidy type.
4.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision (2015) mandated the elimination of export subsidies by both developed and developing countries.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect key aspects of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture.  The agreement, a product of the Uruguay Round negotiations, was finalized in Marrakesh in 1994.  Market Access is indeed a pillar, aiming to reduce tariffs and convert non-tariff barriers (like quotas and variable levies) into equivalent tariffs (tariffication).  Domestic Support addresses the distorting effects of production subsidies, categorized into various boxes (Amber, Blue, Green, etc.) to differentiate between types of support.  Finally, the Nairobi Ministerial Conference in 2015 significantly advanced the elimination of export subsidies, a key goal for promoting fairer trade in agricultural products.  Therefore, all four statements are entirely accurate representations of the Agreement on Agriculture's framework.


**2. Consider the following regarding the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):**

1.  It was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference held in Geneva.
2.  Its primary goal is to curb harmful subsidies that contribute to the overfishing and depletion of fish stocks.
3.  The agreement includes provisions for specific types of subsidies aimed at promoting sustainable fishing practices.
4.  The agreement was immediately implemented globally after its adoption.

Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Geneva Package was adopted during the 12th, not the 11th, Ministerial Conference. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the agreement's implementation is a gradual process, not an immediate global rollout.  Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The Geneva Package's core aim is to combat harmful fishing subsidies that threaten global fish stocks.  While the specifics of the agreement are complex, it does include provisions and mechanisms designed to support sustainable fishing practices.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are inaccurate.


**3. Consider the following aspects of Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security:**

1.  The "Peace Clause" at the 9th Ministerial Conference provided a temporary solution to concerns about PSH's trade-distorting effects.
2.  India advocates for a permanent solution, proposing amendments to the formula used for calculating food subsidy caps.
3.  Developed countries generally support increased de minimis limits for developing countries' PSH programs.
4.  Developing countries argue that PSH is essential for protecting vulnerable farmers and ensuring food security.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 correctly capture the opposing viewpoints on PSH.  India, representing many developing nations, seeks a permanent solution that allows for higher subsidies to support food security and protect its farmers. Developed countries, however, often view PSH as market-distorting and advocate for stricter limits on subsidies.  Statement 1 is correct in that the "Peace Clause" provided temporary relief, but this is not a representation of the global divide itself.  Statement 3 is incorrect; developed countries generally oppose higher de minimis limits, fearing increased trade distortions.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 correctly depict the core disagreement on PSH.


**4. Consider the following statements about the inverted duty structure (IDS):**

1.  IDS occurs when import duties on finished goods exceed those on input goods.
2.  IDS increases the cost of production for domestic industries.
3.  Taxpayers facing IDS have excess Input Tax Credit (ITC) in their GST accounts.
4.  IDS primarily affects the export competitiveness of domestic industries.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the impact of an inverted duty structure?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the consequences of IDS.  IDS arises when input goods face higher import duties or GST rates than finished goods. This increases production costs for domestic businesses (2), leading to a buildup of unutilized Input Tax Credit (ITC) in GST accounts (3).  This excess ITC, along with higher input costs, directly hampers the export competitiveness of domestic industries (4).  Statement 1 is incorrect; the definition of IDS is precisely the opposite—input goods have higher duties than finished goods. Therefore, only three statements correctly describe the impacts of IDS.


**5. Consider the following regarding the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):**

1.  It aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.
2.  Its target is ₹6.0 lakh crore over a period of five years.
3.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for its policy-level matters.
4.  It primarily focuses on the privatization of government-owned companies.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NMP?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the NMP.  The NMP seeks to leverage existing government assets to attract private investment (1).  Its initial target was ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22-FY25), making statement 2 partially incorrect. The Private Investment Unit plays a key role in policy matters concerning the NMP (3). Statement 4 is incorrect; the NMP focuses on monetisation, not necessarily privatization, of assets. Monetisation involves various methods, including long-term leases, concessions, and other forms of asset-backed financing, not just outright sales.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the NMP's objectives and features.


**6. Consider the following about the  WTO’s 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) held in Abu Dhabi:**

1.  It resulted in a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.
2.  It focused on agricultural subsidies and trade negotiations.
3.  It involved discussions on fisheries subsidies.
4.  It concluded with several significant agreements on e-commerce regulation.

How many of the above statements correctly describe outcomes or topics of the MC13?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the MC13.  The conference did address agricultural subsidies and trade negotiations (2), as well as discussions surrounding fisheries subsidies (3), which were ongoing issues.  However, statement 1 is incorrect as MC13 did *not* achieve a permanent solution on PSH.  Statement 4 is also incorrect because significant e-commerce agreements were not a primary focus or outcome of this particular conference.  Therefore, only two statements correctly reflect the conference's focus and results.


**7. Consider the following initiatives related to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India:**

1.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
2.  The Department of Economic Affairs' Private Investment Unit handles policy-level PPP matters.
3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline is a significant PPP initiative.
4.  PPP projects in India are primarily funded by foreign direct investment.

How many of the above statements accurately describe PPP initiatives or frameworks in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a key role in evaluating central government PPP projects (1).  The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for high-level policy decisions on PPPs (2).  The National Monetisation Pipeline, while not solely a PPP initiative, significantly involves private sector participation in infrastructure projects (3).  Statement 4 is incorrect; while foreign investment plays a role, domestic sources of funding are also crucial for PPP projects in India.  Therefore, only three statements correctly describe aspects of PPPs in India.



**8. Consider the following regarding the  Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999:**

1.  It guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific products.
2.  It is primarily aimed at protecting intellectual property rights related to agricultural products.
3.  Its implementation is overseen by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
4.  It prevents biopiracy by registering and protecting traditional knowledge.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the GI Act, 1999?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 accurately describe aspects of the GI Act. The act grants collective rights to producers associated with specific geographical areas to protect the traditional knowledge and reputation linked to their products (1).  It indirectly helps prevent biopiracy by recognizing and protecting unique traditional knowledge embedded in products (4).  Statement 2 is too narrow; while the act protects many agricultural products, it also covers handicrafts and other goods with unique geographical origins.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the GI Act's implementation is primarily handled by Indian authorities, not WIPO.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the key purposes and functions of the GI Act.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP):**

1.  It is built upon a proprietary, closed-source technology platform.
2.  It integrates data from various ministries, including those involved in Bharatmala and Sagarmala projects.
3.  It utilizes ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.
4.  Its primary focus is on the development of railways infrastructure.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features or functions of the PMGS NMP?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the PMGS NMP.  The plan integrates data from multiple ministries, including those responsible for Bharatmala (roads) and Sagarmala (ports) projects (2).  It leverages ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India maps for spatial data (3).  While it encompasses various modes of transportation, a significant focus is on improving transport infrastructure (4).  Statement 1 is incorrect; the NMP is built on open-source technology. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the plan's features and functionalities.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s role in regulating co-operative banks:**

1.  RBI sets NPA provisioning norms for all types of co-operative banks.
2.  Co-operative banks are subject to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
3.  RBI regulates the lending activities of Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS).
4.  The RBI's revised NPA provisioning norms require that provisions for bad and doubtful debts be charged as an expense.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect RBI's role in regulating co-operative banks?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The RBI sets NPA provisioning norms applicable to urban, state, and central co-operative banks (1).  Co-operative banks are indeed subject to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, albeit with certain modifications (2).  The revised norms mandate that provisions for bad and doubtful debts are treated as an expense in the profit and loss account (4).  Statement 3 is incorrect; PACS are not directly regulated by the RBI. They are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the RBI's regulatory role concerning co-operative banks.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987
2.  The Jute I-CARE Project focusing on mechanization and accelerated retting
3.  Establishment of the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) in 1971
4.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)


How many of the above are directly related to initiatives aimed at supporting or regulating the jute industry in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 3 are all directly related to the jute industry. The Jute Packaging Materials Act mandates the use of jute, the Jute I-CARE project improves jute cultivation and processing, and the JCI provides price support.  Option 4, NUCFDC, is focused on urban cooperative banks and is unrelated to the jute industry. Therefore, only three of the listed items are directly related to initiatives supporting or regulating the jute industry.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA), 1956
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992
3.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949
4.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999


How many of the above Acts primarily govern aspects of the Indian financial market, excluding intellectual property rights?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The SCRA, 1956, and the SEBI Act, 1992, directly regulate securities markets and derivatives. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, governs banking institutions.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, deals with intellectual property rights related to geographical indications, not the broader financial market. Thus, only three of the listed Acts are primarily concerned with the Indian financial market (excluding intellectual property).


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)
2.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)
3.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee
4.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)


How many of the above are initiatives or frameworks primarily focused on regulating or supporting the financial health and operations of financial institutions in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PCA framework directly addresses the financial health of UCBs. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates PPP projects, influencing financial aspects of infrastructure development.  NUCFDC is designed to support urban cooperative banks. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), while involving finance, focuses on asset monetization and not directly on the regulation or support of financial institutions themselves. Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 are primarily focused on the regulation and support of financial institutions.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The role of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
2.  The functions of the Delimitation Commission
3.  The operation of the Press Council of India (PCI)
4.  The mandate of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)


How many of the above relate to bodies that perform oversight, regulatory, or quasi-judicial functions within the Indian governance structure?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CAG audits government finances, the Delimitation Commission redraws electoral boundaries, the PCI oversees press ethics, and CARA regulates adoptions.  All four bodies perform oversight, regulatory, or quasi-judicial functions within the Indian system.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS)
2.  The functioning of Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS)
3.  The role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in regulating UCBs
4.  The objective of the One Future Alliance


How many of the above are directly related to initiatives aimed at promoting financial inclusion in India's rural and urban sectors?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NAFIS directly measures financial inclusion in rural areas. PACS provide credit at the grassroots level, contributing to rural financial inclusion. RBI's regulation of UCBs affects urban financial inclusion. The One Future Alliance focuses on digital public infrastructure globally, which can indirectly support financial inclusion but is not a direct initiative within India's financial inclusion structure. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 directly relate to promoting financial inclusion in India.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The BIS Hallmark for precious metals
2.  The BIS Eco Mark for environmentally friendly products
3.  The ISI Mark for certain consumer products
4.  The  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan


How many of the above are quality control or standardization initiatives implemented by Indian government agencies?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The BIS Hallmark, Eco Mark, and ISI Mark are all quality and standardization certifications issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a large-scale infrastructure development plan, not a quality control or standardization initiative. Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 represent quality control or standardization initiatives by Indian government agencies.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge
2.  The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)
3.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001
4.  The Unified Payments Interface (UPI)


How many of the above are directly concerned with protecting or promoting India's traditional knowledge, genetic resources, or intellectual property?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge directly addresses the protection of traditional knowledge.  The TKDL is a digital repository designed to safeguard traditional knowledge. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, protects plant varieties and associated farmers' rights. UPI is a digital payment system unrelated to the protection of traditional knowledge or intellectual property. Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are directly concerned with protecting or promoting India's traditional knowledge, genetic resources, or intellectual property.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India regulated by SEBI
2.  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)
3.  Derivatives regulation under the SCRA, 1956, and SEBI Act, 1992
4.  The concept of Green Shoots in the FMCG sector


How many of the above are related to aspects of India's financial markets or investment instruments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CRAs rate the creditworthiness of entities, InvITs are investment vehicles for infrastructure projects, derivatives regulation governs the trading of derivatives, and the concept of Green Shoots reflects economic growth in a sector, all of which relate to the financial markets or investment instruments in India.  Therefore, all four options are related to aspects of India's financial markets or investment instruments.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  India Stack's Identity Layer (e.g., Aadhaar)
2.  India Stack's Payment Layer (e.g., UPI)
3.  India Stack's Data Governance Layer (e.g., DigiLocker)
4.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)


How many of the above are components or initiatives directly related to the development or advancement of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The three layers of India Stack (Identity, Payment, and Data Governance) are core components of DPI.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is an initiative aimed at furthering the global adoption of DPI.  Therefore, all four options are directly related to the development or advancement of DPI.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Windfall tax
2.  Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
3.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan
4.  The concept of leverage in investments


How many of the above relate to government policies, initiatives, or economic concepts that directly or indirectly impact infrastructure development or fiscal policy in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Windfall tax is a fiscal policy tool. PPPs are a method of financing infrastructure. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a major infrastructure development initiative. The concept of leverage affects investment decisions, influencing both public and private sector infrastructure projects.  Therefore, all four options relate to government policies, initiatives, or economic concepts that impact infrastructure development or fiscal policy in India.


1. Consider the following initiatives related to India's logistics sector:

1. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)
2. Bharatmala Pariyojana
3. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)
4. Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP)

How many of the above initiatives are primarily focused on improving freight transport efficiency?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MMLPs, Bharatmala Pariyojana, and DFCs all contribute to improving freight transport efficiency.  MMLPs aim to streamline the movement of goods by integrating various modes of transport. Bharatmala Pariyojana focuses on expanding and upgrading the national highway network, crucial for efficient road freight. DFCs are designed to significantly increase the share of rail freight, thus enhancing efficiency in rail transport.  LEEP is specifically dedicated to improving freight transport efficiency through various targeted measures. Therefore, three of the listed initiatives directly address freight transport efficiency.


2. Consider the following statements regarding the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) in India:

1.  DFCs aim to reduce the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport.
2.  The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) is responsible for the planning and development of DFCs.
3.  DFCs are primarily intended to improve passenger rail transport.
4.  DFCCIL was incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 2013.

Which of the statements above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. DFCs are explicitly designed to *increase* the share of rail freight traffic, aiming to shift a larger portion of freight from road to rail, thereby improving efficiency and reducing congestion. Statement 3 is incorrect as DFCs focus solely on freight, not passenger transport. Statement 4 is also incorrect; DFCCIL was incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, not 2013. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the facts about DFCs in India.



3. Consider the following aspects of India's offshore mineral resources:

1.  Offshore mining operations are limited to depths less than 200 meters.
2.  The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
3.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable offshore mineral resources.
4.  The Geological Survey of India has identified resources of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules in the Bay of Bengal.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Offshore mining, by definition, takes place at depths *greater* than 200 meters, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, specifically exclude mineral oils and hydrocarbons, contradicting statement 2.  While the Geological Survey of India has identified various offshore mineral resources, the specific location mentioned in statement 4 (Bay of Bengal) is not entirely accurate; the text specifies Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea as locations for polymetallic ferromanganese nodules. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately describes an aspect of India's offshore mineral resources.


4. Consider the following regarding the IMF's lending instruments:

1.  The General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional financing at zero interest rates.
2.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) is primarily designed for high-income countries.
3.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) offers short-term financing to address immediate crises.
4.  The "Gold Tranche" refers to a credit system granted by the IMF to its member countries.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The GRA offers non-concessional (market-based) financing, not concessional financing at zero interest rates, making statement 1 incorrect. The PRGT is specifically designed for low-income countries, not high-income countries, contradicting statement 2. The RST provides longer-term financing, not short-term financing, making statement 3 incorrect.  The "Gold Tranche" (Reserve Tranche) is a real credit system provided by the IMF to its member countries.  Therefore, only statement 4 is accurate.


5. Consider the following statements about the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP):

1.  The WBG-GP was launched in 2023.
2.  The WBG-GP aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance.
3.  The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and experts from across WBG institutions at MIGA.
4.  The WBG-GP primarily provides guarantees for agricultural projects.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The WBG-GP was initiated in 2024, not 2023, making statement 1 incorrect.  The platform aims to *increase*, not reduce, annual guarantee issuance, contradicting statement 2.  While the WBG-GP offers guarantees across various sectors, it's not exclusively focused on agricultural projects, making statement 4 incorrect.  The consolidation of guarantee products and experts at MIGA is a core function of the WBG-GP. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


6. Consider the following features of the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:

1.  It is driven by six engines of economic growth.
2.  It utilizes a digital master planning tool developed by BISAG-N.
3.  It is built on proprietary technology hosted on a private cloud platform.
4.  It integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala and Sagarmala.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The PM GatiShakti plan is driven by *seven*, not six, engines, making statement 1 incorrect.  The plan uses an open-source technology hosted on Meghraj (Government of India's cloud), not a private cloud, contradicting statement 3.  The integration of data from various ministries, including Bharatmala and Sagarmala, is a key feature.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan.


7. Consider the following regarding India's Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):

1.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates state-level PPP projects.
3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce government investment in infrastructure.
4.  The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report analyzed PPP regulatory landscapes across 140 economies.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector*, not state-level, PPP projects. The NMP aims to *generate* investment by monetizing existing government assets, not reduce government investment, clarifying the intent behind statement 3.  The World Bank report's analysis of PPP regulatory landscapes is accurately stated in statement 4. Therefore, three of the statements are correct.


8. Consider the following about the WTO Agreement on Agriculture:

1.  It was negotiated during the Tokyo Round and ratified in Marrakech in 1994.
2.  It includes provisions related to market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.
3.  The "peace clause" provides a permanent solution to the public stockholding issue.
4.  Developed members are exempt from eliminating export subsidies.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Agreement on Agriculture was negotiated during the *Uruguay*, not Tokyo, Round, making statement 1 incorrect. The Agreement does indeed cover market access, domestic support, and export subsidies, as stated in statement 2.  The "peace clause" is an *interim*, not permanent, solution, contradicting statement 3.  Developed members are *not* exempt from eliminating export subsidies; they are expected to eliminate export subsidies per the Nairobi Ministerial Decision 2015, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


9. Consider the following regarding the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies:

1.  It was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference.
2.  It aims to increase harmful fisheries subsidies.
3.  It was adopted in Geneva, Switzerland.
4.  It aims to curb subsidies that contribute to the depletion of fish stocks.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies was adopted during the *12th*, not 11th, Ministerial Conference, making statement 1 incorrect.  The agreement aims to *curb*, not increase, harmful subsidies, contradicting statement 2. The agreement was indeed adopted in Geneva, Switzerland, and its core aim is to reduce subsidies that contribute to the depletion of fish stocks.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect the agreement's details.


10. Consider the following related to India's agricultural sector:

1.  KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for crop yield prediction.
2.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) primarily focuses on providing weather forecasts to farmers.
3.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre uses technologies like artificial intelligence and remote sensing.
4.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is determined solely by the Food Corporation of India.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  ADeX focuses on providing farmer services using datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown data, not primarily weather forecasts, making statement 2 incorrect. The MSP is recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices and finalized by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, not solely determined by the FCI, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe aspects of India's agricultural sector.


11. Consider the following regarding India's agricultural export policy:

1.  Agricultural exports in 2023-24 surpassed the target set by the 2018 policy.
2.  The policy aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.
3.  Agricultural imports also registered a decline in 2023-24.
4.  The policy primarily focuses on promoting the export of only horticultural products.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Agricultural exports in 2023-24 fell *short* of the target set by the 2018 policy, making statement 1 incorrect.  The 2018 policy did aim for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022. Agricultural imports did also decline in 2023-24. The policy encompasses a broader range of agricultural products than just horticultural products, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


12. Consider the following about India's steel sector:

1. Steel is an alloy primarily composed of iron and copper.
2. India's per capita steel consumption is higher than the global average.
3. India largely relies on domestic sources for coking coal.
4. The steel sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. Steel is an alloy of iron and *carbon*, not copper, making statement 1 incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

InvITs are primarily regulated by SEBI, not RBI, making statement 1 incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; InvITs facilitate investment in various infrastructure projects. Statement 3 is incorrect;  the amended regulations allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors, not just publicly listed ones. Statement 4 is correct; sponsors are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the One Future Alliance aims to *support* DPI implementation, not hinder it. Statement 2 is incorrect; the GDPIR was launched in 2023, not 2022. Statement 3 is correct; the EU-TTC is involved in promoting DPI. Statement 4 is also correct; India Stack is indeed a foundational DPI. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

1.  The UPI was launched in 2017.
2.  It is operated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
3.  NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) is involved in its internationalization.
4.  It is an instant real-time payment system.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the UPI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the UPI was launched in 2016, not 2017. Statement 2 is incorrect; the UPI is operated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the RBI. Statement 3 is correct; NIPL is involved in UPI's international expansion. Statement 4 is also correct; it's an instant real-time payment system.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

3.  The Navratna status is granted based on factors like profitability and MoU ratings.
4.  Both IREDA and SECI have been granted Navratna status.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; both IREDA and SECI fall under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not the Ministry of Power. Statement 2 is incorrect; IREDA was established in 1987, not 1988. Statement 3 is correct; the Navratna status criteria include profitability and MoU ratings. Statement 4 is also correct; both IREDA and SECI have received Navratna status.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; GIFT City was established in 2015, not 2016. Statement 2 is incorrect; IFSCs cater to *international* customers, outside the domestic economy's jurisdiction. Statement 3 is correct; the IFSC Authority is a statutory body established under the 2019 Act. Statement 4 is also correct; the Ministry of Finance notification included these services under the IFSC Act. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**11. Consider the following related to the Agri-Stack initiative:**

1.  The Agri-Stack is built on two foundational pillars: the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) and the Kisan Credit Card scheme.
2. The Agri-Stack's Farmer IDs are linked to data like land records.
3.  The DSS uses data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS.
4.  The Agri-Stack aims to create digital identities for 5 crore farmers.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding Agri-Stack?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the DSS is a pillar, the other is the Agri-Stack itself (with its components like Farmer IDs and Crop Sown Registry), not the Kisan Credit Card scheme. Statement 2 is correct; Farmer IDs are linked to relevant data. Statement 3 is correct; the DSS uses the mentioned data sources. Statement 4 is incorrect; the target is 11 crore farmers, not 5 crore.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the interest subvention is 3%, not 5%. Statement 2 is correct; integrated processing projects are eligible. Statement 3 is also correct; convergence with PM-KUSUM Component-A is allowed. Statement 4 is incorrect; NAB Sanrakshan also provides credit guarantee coverage along with CGTMSE. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**13. Consider the following concerning Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1. ARCs are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  ARCs are mandated to resolve assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.
3.  The Narasimham Committee II (1998) recommended the establishment of ARCs.
4.  ARCs buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions.


How many of the above statements accurately describe ARCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; ARCs are primarily regulated by the RBI, not SEBI. Statement 2 is incorrect; the maximum resolution time is 8 years, not 5 years.

1. The PLFS was launched in 2018.
2. The PLFS estimates employment and unemployment indicators.
3. The PLFS data for 2023 showed an unemployment rate of 4.1%.
4. The PLFS is conducted annually.


How many of the above statements are correct about the PLFS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the PLFS was launched in 2017, not 2018. Statement 2 is correct; it estimates key employment and unemployment indicators. Statement 3 is incorrect; the unemployment rate for 2023 was 3.1%, not 4.1%.  While the frequency isn't explicitly stated as annual,  the context suggests it is conducted periodically.  Therefore, only two statements are definitively correct.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Project Nexus:**

1. It is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore.
2.  The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS).
3. It aims to facilitate cross-border payments primarily within South Asian countries.
4. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) plays a significant role in its conceptualization.
5. It is expected to be operational by 2025.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: UPI is indeed an example of an IPS, facilitating instant inter-bank fund transfers.  Statement 4 is also correct: The BIS Innovation Hub played a key role in conceptualizing Project Nexus.  The other statements are incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative, not limited to India and Singapore (Statement 1). Its scope encompasses several countries, including those in ASEAN, not just South Asia (Statement 3). The projected launch date is 2026, not 2025 (Statement 5).


**2. Consider the following regarding Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations:**

2. Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) primarily invest in low-risk, low-return ventures.
3. SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, primarily oversee the functioning of Venture Capital Funds.
4.  Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) are exclusively entities incorporated within India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, are indeed the primary regulatory framework for Venture Capital Funds in India. The other statements misrepresent key aspects of SEBI regulations.  Statement 1 is incorrect because FVCIs invest in *unlisted* companies. Statement 2 is incorrect as VCFs are known for high-risk, high-return investments. Statement 4 is incorrect; FVCIs are incorporated *outside* India.


**3. Consider the following entities regulated by SEBI:**

1.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)
2.  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)
3.  Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs)
4.  Primary Dealers (PDs)

Which of the above are directly regulated by SEBI?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

SEBI directly regulates Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). While the RBI also has a regulatory role concerning CRAs in certain aspects (like accreditation for rating bank loans), SEBI's regulatory authority is primary.  Primary Dealers are primarily regulated by the RBI, not SEBI, making (d) incorrect.  Options (b) and (c) are incomplete as they exclude one or more entities directly under SEBI's purview.


**4. Consider the following statements about InvITs:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds but solely focused on real estate projects.
2.  Sponsors of InvITs cannot be recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
3.  InvITs primarily earn income through dividends from their investments in infrastructure projects.
4.  Investing in InvITs requires a high minimum investment amount.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. InvITs invest in various infrastructure projects, not just real estate (Statement 1). Sponsors are indeed recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act (Statement 2).  InvITs offer a low ticket size, allowing for smaller investments (Statement 4). Statement 3 is partially correct; while dividends are a source of income, InvITs can also earn through tolls, rents, and interest, depending on the nature of the underlying infrastructure asset.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):**

1. It was launched in 2018 with a budget of ₹1 trillion.
2. It focuses solely on upgrading signaling systems in Indian Railways.
3.  It aims to enhance the safety of older ICF coaches.
4. It is a five-year fund.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. The RRSK was launched in 2017-18, not 2018, with a budget of ₹1 lakh crore (₹100 billion), not ₹1 trillion (Statement 1). Its scope is broader than just signaling systems; it encompasses various critical safety infrastructure upgrades (Statement 2). While it indirectly contributes to safer rail travel, its primary focus isn't specifically on older ICF coaches (Statement 3).  Statement 4 is correct; it is a five-year fund.


**6. Consider the following about the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):**

1. NaBFID was established under the Companies Act, 2013.
2. It is classified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) based on its shareholding structure.
3.  It primarily focuses on short-term infrastructure financing.
4. It is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Finance.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. NaBFID was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not the Companies Act, 2013 (Statement 1). While it is a PFI, the notification under the Companies Act, 2013, is related to its classification as such, not its establishment (Statement 2). NaBFID focuses on *long-term* non-recourse financing (Statement 3).  The administrative control may vary slightly depending on the source, but generally, it is not under the Ministry of Finance (Statement 4).


**7. Consider the following statements about the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR):**

1. ICAR was established in 1928 based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture.
2. ICAR-NISA was established in 2022.
3. ICAR is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Rural Development.
4. ICAR's mandate includes research and education in agriculture, horticulture, and animal sciences.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. ICAR was established in 1929, not 1928, based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture (Statement 1).  ICAR is under the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, not the Ministry of Rural Development (Statement 3).  Statements 2 and 4 are correct; ICAR-NISA was renamed in 2022 and ICAR's mandate encompasses the areas mentioned.



**8. Consider the following regarding the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS):**

1. PLFS was launched in 2018.
2. It estimates key employment and unemployment indicators.
3. It is conducted annually.
4.  Its data is used to calculate the national unemployment rate.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are definitively correct. PLFS does estimate key employment and unemployment indicators, and its data is indeed used to calculate the national unemployment rate.  Statement 1 is incorrect; PLFS was launched in 2017.  The frequency of PLFS data releases might create some confusion, but it is not strictly an *annual* survey in the sense of data collection every calendar year; therefore statement 3 is also incorrect.


**9. Consider the following about India's initiatives to promote the space economy:**

1. The Indian Space Policy 2023 aims to limit the participation of Non-Government Entities (NGEs).
2.  A ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund was announced in Budget 2024-25.
3. The Indian Space Association (ISpA) was established in 2021.
4. New Space India Limited (NSIL) is responsible for handling commercial activities of ISRO.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. The Indian Space Policy 2023 *enables* end-to-end participation of NGEs, not limits it (Statement 1). ISpA was established in 2020, not 2021 (Statement 3).  Statements 2 and 4 are correct; a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund was announced, and NSIL handles ISRO's commercial activities.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF):**

1. EIF is a bilateral partnership between India and Finland.
2. Its primary goal is to promote trade as an engine for growth in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
3. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is not involved in supporting EIF.
4.  It has more than 50 partner countries.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. EIF is a *multilateral* partnership, not limited to India and Finland (Statement 1). The WTO *does* support EIF (Statement 3).  While the number is close, it has 51 partner countries, not "more than 50" (Statement 4). Statement 2 is correct; promoting trade in LDCs is a core objective of EIF.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following aspects of the TRIPS Agreement:**

1.  Minimum standards of intellectual property protection for member countries.
2.  Incorporation of provisions from the WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions.
3.  Dispute settlement mechanisms handled exclusively by the UN.
4.  Allowance for compulsory licensing in specific circumstances.

Which of the above are accurate descriptions of the TRIPS Agreement's key features?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement, a crucial part of the WTO framework, sets minimum standards of intellectual property protection that member countries must adhere to.  This ensures a baseline level of protection for various forms of intellectual property, promoting innovation and fair trade.  The agreement explicitly incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions, signifying its alignment with established international norms in intellectual property rights.  Crucially, TRIPS also allows for compulsory licensing under specific conditions, a mechanism that enables countries, especially developing nations, to produce patented products or processes without the patent owner's consent in situations of national emergency or public health crises.  This flexibility is vital for ensuring access to essential medicines and technologies.  However, the statement about dispute settlement being handled exclusively by the UN is incorrect; TRIPS disputes fall under the WTO's own dispute settlement system, not the UN's.


**2. Consider the following statements related to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India:**

1.  GFCF consistently remained above 25% of GDP from independence until economic liberalization.
2.  Private investment, as a component of GFCF, experienced a significant decline after 2011-12.
3.  GFCF's growth is directly proportional to the country's trade deficit.
4.  The 1980s saw GFCF as a percentage of GDP rise to approximately 27%.

Which of the above statements regarding GFCF in India are correct?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While GFCF fluctuated, it did not consistently remain above 25% of GDP in the pre-liberalization era. Statement 2 is accurate.  Post-2011-12, private investment, a major driver of GFCF, experienced a notable downturn, posing a challenge to economic growth. Statement 3 is incorrect.  There is no direct proportionality between GFCF growth and the trade deficit. While a trade deficit can influence investment through factors like currency fluctuations, it's not a direct determinant of GFCF.  Statement 4 is correct.  The 1980s did witness a rise in GFCF as a percentage of GDP, though it did not reach 27% until much later.



**3. Consider the following regarding the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS:**

1.  It was established to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).
2.  It solely focuses on Pillar One: reallocation of profits to consumer countries.
3.  India is not a participating member of this framework.
4.  It aims to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) was indeed established to address the issue of tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).  A key aspect of this framework is the implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate (Pillar Two), aiming to prevent tax competition and ensure fair taxation.  While Pillar One addresses profit allocation to consumer markets, the framework is not solely focused on it; Pillar Two is equally important.  Finally, India is an active participant in the BEPS Inclusive Framework, actively contributing to global tax reforms.



**4. Consider the following concerning the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies:**

1.  It aims to eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies to promote sustainable fishing practices.
2.  It provides a transition period for developed countries but not for developing countries.
3.  India is a signatory to this agreement.
4.  The agreement requires acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members to come into effect.


Which of the statements accurately reflect the key features of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies?

(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb *harmful* subsidies, not eliminate all subsidies.  The agreement does include provisions for special and differential treatment, offering transition periods to developing and least developed countries.  India, at the time of writing, has not yet signed or ratified the agreement.  Finally, the agreement does require a two-thirds majority for entry into force.


**5. Consider the following about India's initiatives to promote exports:**

1.  The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS).
2.  The Trade Connect e-Platform is primarily aimed at assisting large multinational corporations.
3.  The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is a private sector institution dedicated to export promotion.
4.  The RoDTEP scheme refunds only central level taxes and duties on exported products.


Which of the above statements correctly describe initiatives taken by India to boost its exports?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; RoDTEP replaced MEIS.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Trade Connect e-Platform is designed to help MSMEs as well.  Statement 3 is incorrect; IIFT is an autonomous public body.  Statement 4 is incorrect; RoDTEP refunds taxes and levies at the central, state, and local levels.


**6. Consider the following regarding Asset Monetization in India:**

1.  The National Monetization Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years (FY22 to FY26).
2.  The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant.
3.  The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) is primarily focused on private sector projects.
4.  Asset Monetization involves the transfer of ownership of government assets to private entities.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Asset Monetization in India?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NMP's timeframe is four years (FY22-FY25).  Statement 2 is incorrect; VGF provides up to 40%, not 50%.  Statement 3 is incorrect; IIPDF aids both public and private projects.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; asset monetization typically involves licensing or leasing, not outright ownership transfer.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP):**

1.  MAP is a mechanism used to resolve double taxation disputes arising from tax treaties (e.g., DTAA).
2.  MAP primarily addresses disputes related to transfer pricing.
3.  MAP is an alternative to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs).
4.  MAP resolves disputes relating to both juridical and economic aspects of double taxation.

Which of the statements accurately describe the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MAP is indeed a mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes arising from tax treaties. While it often addresses transfer pricing disputes, it's not limited to them.  MAP serves as an alternative to APAs, offering a resolution method for existing disputes.  Finally, MAP deals with both juridical and economic aspects of double taxation.


**8. Consider the following statements about Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India:**

1.  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the nodal department for FDI policy formulation.
2.  FDI is permitted only through the government route (requiring approval).
3.  Automatic Route permits FDI without government approval.
4.  Investments above 10% of a company's paid-up capital are always considered FDI.


Which of the above statements regarding FDI in India are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

DPIIT is the nodal department for FDI policy.  FDI is permitted through both automatic and government routes.  The automatic route does not require government approval.  While investments above 10% are often considered FDI, it's not an absolute rule; other factors also determine FDI classification.


**9. Consider the following about the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture:**

1.  Tariffication involves converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.
2.  The Agreement on Agriculture deals with market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.
3.  Developed countries have completely eliminated export subsidies under the Agreement on Agriculture.
4.  The "Peace Clause" provides a permanent solution to the public stockholding (PSH) issue.

Which of the statements correctly describe aspects of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tariffication is a key element of the Agreement. The agreement addresses market access, domestic support, and export subsidies. While developed countries have largely eliminated export subsidies, complete elimination hasn't been fully achieved.  The "Peace Clause" is an interim, not a permanent, solution to the PSH issue.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the  Duty Drawback scheme in India:**

1.  The scheme rebates customs duty on imported materials used in export production.
2.  It is administered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).
3.  It aims to increase the cost of exports for Indian businesses.
4.  The duty drawback is disbursed manually to exporters.

Which statements accurately describe the Duty Drawback scheme?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Duty Drawback scheme does rebate customs duty on imported inputs used in exports. CBIC administers the scheme.  The scheme aims to reduce, not increase, export costs.  The drawback is now disbursed electronically, not manually.


**11. Consider the following regarding the Windfall Tax:**

1.  It is levied on industries experiencing unusually high profits due to favorable economic conditions.
2.  It is primarily aimed at discouraging investment in those specific sectors.
3.  It is a tax imposed only on the import of certain goods.
4.  It is a tax only levied on the services sector.

Which of the statements accurately describes the Windfall Tax?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A windfall tax targets industries with unexpectedly high profits from favorable circumstances. It's not primarily designed to discourage investment but rather to capture some of the excess profits.  It's not limited to imports or the services sector; it can apply to various industries experiencing windfall gains.

(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

DTAAs aim to avoid double taxation.  The India-Mauritius DTAA amendment did include the PPT.  DTAAs are bilateral, not unilateral.  They aim to *reduce*, not increase, the tax burden on foreign investors to encourage investment.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's trade deficit:**

1. A widening trade deficit can lead to a depletion of foreign exchange reserves.
2. Increased imports of capital goods can positively contribute to domestic investment.
3.  A trade deficit always negatively impacts a country's credit rating.
4.  The RoDTEP scheme aims to reduce the cost of imports for Indian businesses.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the impacts and initiatives related to India's trade deficit?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of India's trade deficit. A large trade deficit, where imports significantly exceed exports, necessitates the use of foreign exchange reserves to settle payments, potentially leading to currency depreciation.  This is a negative consequence. Conversely, increased imports of capital goods—machinery and equipment used for production—can boost domestic investment and long-term economic growth, representing a positive aspect.  Statement 3 is incorrect because while a persistent and large trade deficit can *negatively* affect a country's credit rating by indicating macroeconomic imbalances, it doesn't *always* do so. Other factors like fiscal management and overall economic strength also play a crucial role. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products) scheme focuses on *refunding* taxes and levies on *exported* products, aiming to boost exports, not reduce import costs.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are accurate.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to promoting exports from India:**

1.  The Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) is currently the primary export incentive scheme.
2.  The Trade Connect e-Platform facilitates international trade for Indian exporters, particularly MSMEs.
3.  The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is a private sector institution focused solely on export promotion.
4.  The RoDTEP scheme replaced the MEIS scheme to provide refunds for taxes and levies on exported goods.

How many of the above statements correctly describe export promotion initiatives in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The Trade Connect e-Platform is a government initiative designed to streamline information and processes for Indian exporters, especially MSMEs. Statement 4 is also correct: The RoDTEP scheme indeed replaced the MEIS scheme and aims to refund central, state, and local taxes and levies on exported products. Statement 1 is incorrect; MEIS was *replaced* by RoDTEP. Statement 3 is also incorrect; IIFT is a public institution (granted "Deemed to be University" status) focused on foreign trade, encompassing research, training, and education, not solely on export promotion. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the facts.



**3. Consider the following regarding Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India:**

1.  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is responsible for FDI policy formulation.
2.  FDI inflows into India have consistently increased year-on-year.
3.  All FDI is permitted through the automatic route, eliminating the need for government approval.
4.  The government route for FDI approval is reserved only for investments in sensitive sectors.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of FDI in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: DPIIT is the nodal department for formulating India's FDI policy. Statement 2 is incorrect: FDI inflows can fluctuate; the provided text indicates a contraction in FDI inflows in a specific year.  Statement 3 is incorrect: FDI can be permitted through both the automatic route (no government approval needed) and the government route (approval required). Statement 4 is partially correct. While the government route is used for investments needing scrutiny, it's not strictly limited to sensitive sectors.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct. The other statements contain inaccuracies or incomplete information, making only two partially correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about Project Nexus:**

1.  Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore focused on cross-border payments.
2.  An Instant Payment System (IPS) facilitates inter-bank fund transfers within minutes.
3.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is a private financial institution based in London.
4.  Project Nexus aims to reduce the cost and improve the speed of cross-border payments.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Project Nexus and related concepts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct:  An IPS is indeed an electronic payment system enabling fast inter-bank fund transfers. Statement 4 is also correct: A core objective of Project Nexus is to make cross-border payments cheaper, faster, and more accessible. Statement 1 is incorrect; Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative involving several countries, not just India and Singapore. Statement 3 is incorrect; the BIS is owned by central banks, not a private institution, and is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.  Therefore, three statements (2, 4, and partially 1) offer accurate information related to the concept of Project Nexus, though some are incomplete.



**5. Consider the following concerning the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI):**

1.  SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, govern only domestic venture capital investors.
2.  Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) can invest directly in unlisted Indian companies.
3.  Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) are primarily used for low-risk, low-return investments.
4.  SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, provide the regulatory framework for VCFs in India.

How many of the above statements accurately describe SEBI's role and regulations related to venture capital?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: FVCIs are allowed to invest in venture capital undertakings (unlisted companies) in India.  Statement 4 is also correct: SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, govern Venture Capital Funds in India. Statement 1 is incorrect; SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, specifically address *foreign* venture capital investors.  Statement 3 is incorrect; VCFs are typically associated with *high-risk, high-return* investments, not low-risk, low-return investments. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the facts about SEBI's regulations.



**6. Consider the following regarding India Stack:**

1.  India Stack's identity layer primarily relies on the use of PAN cards for digital identification.
2.  The UPI (Unified Payments Interface) forms part of India Stack's payment layer.
3.  DigiLocker contributes to India Stack's data governance layer.
4.  The One Future Alliance is an initiative solely focused on promoting India Stack's adoption globally.

How many of the above statements correctly describe India Stack and related initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: UPI is a key component of India Stack's payment layer. Statement 3 is correct: DigiLocker contributes to the data governance layer of India Stack. Statement 1 is incorrect; Aadhaar, not PAN cards, is the primary identity system used within India Stack's identity layer. Statement 4 is incorrect; the One Future Alliance is a broader G20 initiative aimed at supporting the development and implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in low- and middle-income countries, not solely focused on promoting India Stack.  Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and partially 1) accurately describe aspects of India Stack and related initiatives.


**7. Consider the following statements about the internationalization of the Indian Rupee (INR):**

1.  The INR is fully convertible in both the current and capital accounts.
2.  Special Vostro Rupee Accounts (SVRAs) facilitate INR trade settlements with several countries.
3.  The inclusion of the INR in CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement) has significantly reduced its volatility.
4.  Masala bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued by Indian entities for foreign investors.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the steps taken for the internationalization of the INR?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: SVRAs are a key mechanism enabling INR-based trade settlements.  Statement 4 is correct: Masala bonds represent a method for raising capital internationally using the INR.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the INR is fully convertible in the current account but only partially in the capital account.  Statement 3 is partially correct; inclusion in CLS improves settlement efficiency but doesn't directly reduce INR volatility, which is influenced by many other market factors.  Therefore, three statements (2, 4, and partially 3) offer partially correct information regarding the INR's internationalization efforts.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India:**

1.  GFCF has consistently remained above 25% of GDP since economic liberalization.
2.  Private investment, as a component of GFCF, reached its lowest point in 2020-21.
3.  GFCF is synonymous with national savings.
4.  The growth of GFCF is a primary indicator of investment in the Indian economy.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of GFCF in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: Private investment, a crucial part of GFCF, did indeed reach a low point in 2020-21. Statement 4 is correct: GFCF is a key indicator of investment levels in the economy. Statement 1 is incorrect: GFCF fluctuated significantly, and wasn't consistently above 25% of GDP post-liberalization.  Statement 3 is incorrect: GFCF represents investment, not national savings, although there's a relationship between the two.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately describe the characteristics of GFCF in India.


**9. Consider the following related to India's engagement with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS):**

1.  India joined the TRIPS Agreement in 1994.
2.  The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing of patented products or processes.
3.  The Doha Declaration on TRIPS explicitly prohibits measures to protect public health.
4.  Amendments to India's Patents Act, 1970, were made to align with TRIPS obligations.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's engagement with the TRIPS Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct:  The TRIPS Agreement does include provisions for compulsory licensing.  Statement 4 is correct: India did amend its Patents Act to comply with TRIPS. Statement 1 is incorrect; India joined TRIPS in 1995, not 1994.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Doha Declaration *affirms* that TRIPS doesn't and shouldn't prevent members from taking measures to protect public health, utilizing flexibilities within the agreement.  Therefore, only three statements (2, 4, and partially 1) offer partially correct information regarding India's TRIPS engagement.


**10. Consider the following about the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):**

1.  NaBFID is primarily focused on short-term infrastructure financing.
2.  NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  NaBFID's objective includes the development of infrastructure-related bonds and derivatives markets.
4.  NaBFID is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a major Indian private sector bank.


How many of the above statements accurately describe NaBFID and its characteristics?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct:  NaBFID does aim to support long-term infrastructure financing and the development of related financial markets. Statement 1 is incorrect; NaBFID focuses on *long-term*, not short-term, financing.  Statement 2 is incorrect; NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  Statement 4 is incorrect; NaBFID is wholly owned by the Government of India, not a private sector bank. Therefore, only one statement (3) accurately reflects information about NaBFID.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's e-commerce sector and related policies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: ONDC aims to create a more open and inclusive e-commerce environment. Statement 4 is correct: The 2020 rules focus on consumer protection in e-commerce. Statement 1 is incorrect; the projected value is closer to $325 billion, not $400 billion. Statement 2 is incorrect; FDI is *not* fully permitted in the inventory-based model in India, to protect domestic retail businesses. Therefore, three statements (3, 4, and partially 1) are partially correct concerning India's e-commerce sector and related policies.


**12. Consider the following statements related to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs):**

1.  DTAAs aim to prevent the same income from being taxed twice in two different countries.

How many of the above statements accurately describe DTAAs and related concepts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: DTAAs are designed to avoid double taxation of income. Statement 2 is correct: The India-Mauritius DTAA amendment did incorporate the PPT. Statement 3 is correct: MAP is a mechanism to resolve double taxation disputes. Statement 4 is incorrect; BEPS refers to strategies used to *reduce* or *avoid* taxes, not increase them.  Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 3) accurately describe aspects of DTAAs and related concepts.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct:  Bullion accurately describes precious metals in bar, ingot, or coin form. Statement 4 is correct: SBI was the first trading-cum-clearing member. Statement 1 is incorrect; IIBX is located in GIFT City, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, not Mumbai. Statement 2 is incorrect; IIBX is regulated by the IFSCA (International Financial Services Centres Authority), not RBI. Therefore, three statements (3, 4, and partially 1) offer partially correct information about IIBX and related concepts.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: Carry trade is indeed linked to foreign exchange markets. Statement 4 is correct: Interest rate fluctuations can substantially affect the returns of carry trade strategies.  Statement 1 is incorrect; carry trade involves borrowing in a *low*-interest-rate currency. Statement 2 is incorrect; carry trade is considered a *high*-risk strategy due to currency volatility and interest rate changes.  Therefore, three statements (3, 4, and partially 1) offer partially correct information about carry trade.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: EIF's main goal is to leverage trade for poverty reduction in LDCs. Statement 3 is correct: The World Bank is a supporting organization. Statement 1 is incorrect; EIF is a *multilateral* partnership, not bilateral. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UNOPS (United Nations Office for Project Services) manages EIF's Trust Fund, not the IMF. Therefore, three statements (2, 3, and partially 1) offer partially correct information about EIF.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills relevant to the UPSC exam.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why the other options are incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The MSP indeed covers a specified number of crops as indicated, the CACP's role in recommending MSPs and the Cabinet's final decision-making authority are accurate.  The ambitious target set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy is also correctly stated. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the FCI is a major player, it's not the sole procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.  Statement 5 is also incorrect because KISAN utilizes space technology and geoinformatics for yield estimation, not only traditional methods.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's financial inclusion initiatives:**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  NAFIS is a comprehensive survey used to assess financial inclusion in rural areas, and the NAFINDEX is indeed derived from this data. Statement 3 is incorrect; PACS are not directly regulated by the RBI, but by state cooperative societies acts.  Statement 4 is partially correct; the loan limit was *increased* to ₹20 lakh under the 2024 budget. Statement 5 is therefore also incorrect.


**5. Consider the following statements about the World Trade Organization (WTO):**

How many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of the WTO's agreements?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The AoA does indeed cover market access, domestic support, and export subsidies. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb harmful practices. Developed countries generally advocate for removing export restrictions. Statement 2 is incorrect; the "peace clause" is an *interim* solution, not a permanent one. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Nairobi Decision applied to both developed and developing countries.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics and adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's oilseed production:**

1. A significant portion of oilseed cultivation in India relies on rain-fed agriculture.
2. Groundnut production is concentrated in a few specific states.
3. The National Food Security Mission – Oilseeds & Oil Palm primarily focuses on improving oil palm cultivation.
4. PM-AASHA aims to ensure Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for all agricultural commodities.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation is rainfed, highlighting the dependence on monsoons.  Statement 2 is also accurate; Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka contribute a substantial majority (83.4%) of India's groundnut production, demonstrating regional concentration.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NFSM-OS&OP does address oil palm, its primary focus is broader, encompassing seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer across various oilseeds.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate. PM-AASHA focuses on ensuring MSP for oilseeds specifically, not all agricultural commodities. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 and 3 are accurate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 2 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the RBI's findings on stagnant millet production. Statement 2 correctly identifies a shift in consumer preference as a contributing factor to the stagnation.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the National Food Security Mission has a broader scope than just millets, although it does include millet production as one of its components. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the PLISMBP specifically targets millet-based products for incentives.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's household savings:**

1.  Household savings are categorized solely into financial and physical savings.
2.  A decline in financial savings poses no significant challenge to the banking sector.
3.  The household savings rate is calculated as the ratio of household savings to GDP.
4.  In India, the household sector consistently invests more than its savings generation.


Which of the above statements accurately describe aspects of household savings in India?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While financial and physical savings are major components, the categorization might include other forms of savings not explicitly mentioned in the text.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the regulatory oversight of UCBs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Capital adequacy is a crucial aspect of banking regulation, ensuring banks have sufficient capital to absorb potential losses.  UCBs are no exception, and their capital levels are closely monitored by the RBI.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI uses PCA as a tool to address financial weaknesses in banks.  If a UCB breaches pre-defined risk thresholds related to capital, asset quality, or profitability, the RBI may impose PCA, which involves restrictions on activities and operations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  A UCB's exit from PCA typically requires consistent compliance with all relevant risk parameters over four consecutive quarters, not just two. This ensures sustained improvement in the bank's financial health. The RBI needs to be confident that the improvement is not temporary.


Statement 4 is partially correct. While the Malegam Committee focused on regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)-MFIs, its recommendations indirectly influenced the regulatory framework for UCBs. However, the committee did not directly set up regulatory frameworks for UCBs.  The RBI's regulations for UCBs are a product of multiple committees and evolving regulatory practices.


Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4, partially) are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MPI report is jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not the World Bank and OPHI.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 MPI report did indeed indicate that over 1 billion people were living in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India, with 234 million people, had the *largest* number of people living in extreme poverty among the countries surveyed, not the lowest.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The MPI uses a multidimensional approach, considering factors beyond just economic indicators. It incorporates various dimensions of poverty, including health, education, and living standards.


Only statement 2 is accurate.


5. Consider the following statements related to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) within the World Trade Organization (WTO):

1. The AoA was negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in 1994 in Marrakech, Morocco.
2.  The AoA primarily deals with tariff reduction, but not non-tariff barriers.
3.  The "peace clause" is a permanent solution addressing public stockholding for food security.
4.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision (2015) eliminated export subsidies for both developed and developing countries.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AoA was indeed a product of the Uruguay Round negotiations and was ratified in Marrakech in 1994.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AoA addresses both tariff and non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade.  "Tariffication," a key element of the AoA, mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "peace clause" is an *interim* solution, not a permanent one, providing temporary protection for countries' public stockholding programs.  A permanent solution remains a point of contention within the WTO.

Statement 4 is correct. The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 did eliminate export subsidies for both developed and developing member countries of the WTO.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


6. Consider the following about India's initiatives to protect Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Genetic Resources (GRs):

1. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is a digital repository aimed at preventing biopiracy.
2.  India's Patent Act, 1970, incorporates the prior informed consent (PIC) mechanism for the use of GRs and TK.
3. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is unrelated to the Convention on Biological Diversity.
4. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, primarily protects individual rights over traditional knowledge.

How many of the statements accurately describe India's measures to safeguard TK and GRs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TKDL serves as a crucial tool in preventing biopiracy by providing a readily accessible database of traditional knowledge, thus allowing for easier identification of potential infringements.

Statement 2 is correct. India's Patent Act, 1970, has provisions related to the disclosure of involved GRs and TK, which has elements similar to a Prior Informed Consent (PIC) mechanism,  though it might not be explicitly named as such.  The aim is to ensure that traditional knowledge is not exploited without proper consent and benefit-sharing agreements.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is directly aligned with and implements the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is an international treaty focused on the conservation of biodiversity.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects *collective* rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions, not individual rights.  It safeguards the reputation and distinctiveness of products linked to particular regions.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


7. Consider the following about the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement:

1.  The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards of intellectual property protection for WTO members.
2.  The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.
3.  Disputes under the TRIPS Agreement are settled through mechanisms outside the WTO's dispute settlement system.
4.  The TRIPS Agreement prohibits compulsory licensing under any circumstances.

How many of the above statements accurately describe features of the TRIPS Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards of protection for various forms of intellectual property, ensuring a baseline level of protection across WTO member countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  The TRIPS Agreement draws heavily upon the established international frameworks provided by WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions, incorporating many of their key provisions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Disputes arising under the TRIPS Agreement are subject to the WTO's well-established dispute settlement procedures, which provide a mechanism for resolving trade disagreements between member countries.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement actually *allows* for compulsory licensing, particularly in situations concerning public health.  This flexibility allows countries to produce patented products or processes without the patent owner's consent under specific circumstances.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


8. Consider the following related to India's National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):

1. NaBFID's primary objective is to support short-term infrastructure financing in India.
2.  NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  NaBFID's entire shareholding is currently held by the Government of India.
4. NaBFID's operations primarily focus on equity financing for infrastructure projects.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding NaBFID?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term*, not short-term, non-recourse infrastructure financing.  The focus is on providing stable, long-term funding for infrastructure projects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The RBI's oversight ensures the financial stability and soundness of NaBFID's operations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Government of India currently holds the entire shareholding of NaBFID.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While NaBFID can provide funding through various instruments, its operations are not limited to equity financing. It can utilize a range of financial instruments to support infrastructure development.


Only statement 3 is accurate.


9. Consider the following statements concerning India's e-commerce market:

1.  India's e-commerce market is projected to reach $325 billion by 2030, according to Invest India.
2.  In 2022, the e-commerce sector contributed over 15% of India's total retail market.
3.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.
4. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create a closed-source e-commerce network.

How many of the statements correctly reflect aspects of India's e-commerce landscape?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Invest India's projections indicate a significant growth trajectory for India's e-commerce market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In 2022, the e-commerce sector contributed approximately 7%, not over 15%, of India's total retail market.  While growing rapidly, it still constitutes a relatively smaller portion of the overall retail market.

Statement 3 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India to protect the domestic retail sector.  FDI is allowed in the marketplace model.

Statement 4 is incorrect. ONDC is designed to be an *open-source* network, promoting greater transparency and interoperability within the e-commerce ecosystem.


Only statement 1 is accurate.


10. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index):

1. The FI-Index includes data from the banking, investment, and insurance sectors, but excludes postal and pension sectors.
2. The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial exclusion.
3. The FI-Index incorporates three broad parameters: Access, Usage, and Quality.
4. The RBI publishes the FI-Index annually in January.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the RBI's FI-Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index *does* include data from the postal and pension sectors, providing a more holistic view of financial inclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A score of 100 on the FI-Index represents *full* financial inclusion, not complete exclusion.  0 represents complete exclusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The three parameters—Access, Usage, and Quality—form the core components of the FI-Index.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The RBI publishes the FI-Index annually in July, not January.


Only statements 3 is correct.  Therefore, the answer is (a).




**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)
2.  The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
3.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)
4.  The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP)

How many of the above are initiatives specifically focused on providing financial support or infrastructure development in least-developed countries or underserved areas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership dedicated to assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in using trade for growth and poverty reduction.  Therefore, 1 is correct. The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) funds telecom schemes in underserved rural areas, directly addressing the needs of LDCs or similar regions. Thus, 3 is correct. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), while involved in infrastructure development, doesn't have a specific focus on LDCs; its goal is broader, aiming to boost global guarantee issuance.  Therefore, 4 is incorrect.  The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), while previously focused on underserved areas in India, was replaced by the DBN.  Therefore, 2 is incorrect.  Only two of the listed initiatives (EIF and DBN) directly target financial support or infrastructure in LDCs or underserved regions.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
2.  The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package)
3.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge
4.  The Agreement on Agriculture

How many of the above agreements under the World Trade Organization (WTO) incorporate provisions related to special and differential treatment for developing countries?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS agreement, while setting minimum standards for intellectual property protection, includes mechanisms allowing developing countries flexibility in implementing those standards, thus implicitly incorporating special and differential treatment.  The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies offers a transition period for developing countries and LDCs to adapt to new subsidy regulations. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge acknowledges the rights of indigenous peoples and developing nations in managing their genetic resources and traditional knowledge. The Agreement on Agriculture includes provisions for special and differential treatment for developing countries regarding market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.  All three agreements include elements of special and differential treatment for developing countries, designed to account for their unique economic circumstances and development needs.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding indices related to human development:**

1.  The Human Development Index (HDI) is published annually by the World Bank.
2.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender disparities across three key dimensions.
3.  The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) considers inequality's impact on HDI.
4.  The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) focuses solely on income poverty.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the HDI is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct; the GII measures gender inequalities in reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market. Statement 3 is correct; the IHDI adjusts the HDI to reflect the impact of inequality. Statement 4 is incorrect; the MPI considers multiple dimensions of poverty beyond just income, such as health, education, and living standards.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)
2.  The 'crowding out' effect
3.  The Change in Stock (CIS)
4.  Net Capital Formation (NCF)

How many of the above are directly related to measuring or understanding investment levels and capital accumulation within an economy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is a key measure of investment in fixed assets. The 'crowding out' effect describes how increased government spending can reduce private investment. The Change in Stock (CIS) accounts for changes in inventories, a component of overall investment. Net Capital Formation (NCF) adjusts GFCF for depreciation, providing a clearer picture of net capital accumulation. All four concepts are directly related to measuring or understanding investment and capital accumulation within an economy, reflecting different aspects of the investment process and its impact.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to infrastructure development in India:**

1.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)
3.  The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework
4.  The Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index

How many of the above are primarily focused on enhancing infrastructure in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan aims to improve infrastructure across various sectors. The National Monetisation Pipeline seeks to generate investment by monetising government assets, indirectly supporting infrastructure development. The Public-Private Partnership framework encourages private sector involvement in infrastructure projects. The Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, while relevant to the investment climate, is not directly focused on infrastructure development.  Therefore, three of the initiatives are primarily focused on enhancing infrastructure in India.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
2.  The World Bank
3.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT)
4.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST)

How many of the above are international financial institutions that provide financial assistance to countries, particularly those facing economic challenges?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides financial support to countries facing crises. The World Bank offers loans and assistance for development projects. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), both under the IMF, provide concessional financing to low-income and vulnerable countries.  All four are international financial institutions providing financial assistance to countries, especially those facing economic hardship.  They differ in their specific focus and lending mechanisms but share the common goal of supporting global economic stability and development.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999
2.  The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)
3.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge
4.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer's Rights Act, 2001

How many of the above are measures specifically aimed at protecting India’s traditional knowledge and genetic resources?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act protects traditional products linked to specific regions. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library acts as a repository to prevent biopiracy. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge aims to harmonize intellectual property rights with the protection of genetic resources and traditional knowledge. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer's Rights Act safeguards farmers' rights over plant varieties.  All four are measures designed to protect India's traditional knowledge and genetic resources, employing different strategies to achieve this goal.  They reflect India's commitment to safeguarding its intellectual heritage and biodiversity.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the Agreement on Agriculture under the WTO:

1.  It was negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in Marrakesh.
2.  It includes provisions related to market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.
3.  Tariffication involves converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.
4.  The "peace clause" provides a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) was indeed negotiated during the Uruguay Round and formally adopted in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 1994.  It covers three pillars: market access (including tariffication, the process of converting non-tariff barriers like quotas into tariffs), domestic support (subsidies influencing production and trade), and export subsidies (measures making exports artificially competitive).  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The "peace clause," agreed upon at the Bali Ministerial Conference (MC9), is an *interim* solution to the PSH issue, not a permanent one.  India continues to push for a permanent solution that addresses the concerns of developing countries regarding food security and price support programs.  The AoA's complexities highlight the ongoing tension between developed and developing nations regarding agricultural trade and subsidies.


2. Consider the following aspects of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):

1.  It aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion.
2.  It was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO.
3.  It grants a transition period to developing countries.
4.  India is a signatory to this agreement.

Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Geneva Package explicitly aims to reduce harmful fishing subsidies that deplete fish stocks. Statement 3 is also correct; the agreement provides a transition period, particularly for developing and least developed countries, to adjust to the new regulations. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the agreement was adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference, not the 11th.  Crucially, statement 4 is also incorrect;  as of December 2024, the agreement is still short of the required number of ratifications to enter into force, and India is not yet a signatory. The complexities surrounding this agreement reflect the challenges in balancing environmental sustainability with the economic needs of fishing nations, especially developing countries.


3. Consider the following features of the WTO’s TRIPS Agreement:

1.  It sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.
2.  It incorporates provisions from the WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions.
3.  It allows for compulsory licensing under specific circumstances.
4.  It established a permanent solution for resolving disputes related to IPR.

How many of the statements above accurately describe the TRIPS Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) does establish minimum standards for IPR protection across WTO member countries.  It incorporates elements from the Paris and Berne Conventions, providing a framework for international harmonization of IPR laws.  It also includes provisions for compulsory licensing, allowing governments to license patented products or processes without the patent holder's consent under certain conditions, often to address public health concerns. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While TRIPS provides a dispute settlement mechanism through the WTO's general dispute settlement procedures, it doesn't establish a separate, permanent body solely for resolving IPR disputes. The dispute resolution process is integrated within the broader WTO framework.


4. Consider the following regarding Public Stockholding (PSH) policies:

1.  PSH allows governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSP).
2.  Developed countries generally support higher de minimis limits for PSH.
3.  The de minimis limits are calculated using a reference price from 1986-88.
4.  Developing countries advocate for amendments in the formula to calculate price support subsidies.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the global divide on PSH?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct representations of the global debate surrounding PSH.  PSH programs do allow governments to purchase crops from farmers at MSPs, providing price support and food security. The de minimis limits, which define the permissible level of subsidies, are indeed calculated using a reference price based on 1986-88 data—a point of contention for developing countries. Developing nations argue that this outdated formula needs revision to allow for higher subsidies to protect their farmers. However, statement 2 is incorrect; developed countries generally *oppose* higher de minimis limits for PSH, arguing that such policies distort markets.  This reflects the core disagreement between developed and developing nations on the balance between food security and trade liberalization.


5.  Consider the following concerning India’s agricultural sector:

1.  The Agricultural Export Policy aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.
2.  Agricultural exports in India declined by 8% in 2023-24.
3.  MSP covers 24 crops, including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 4 commercial crops.
4.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. India's Agricultural Export Policy did indeed set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, a target that was not met.  Agricultural exports did experience an 8% decline in 2023-24. The CACP plays a crucial role in recommending MSPs to the government. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the MSP covers a significant number of crops, it does not cover 24; the number is actually 22, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (Jute and Copra).  The discrepancy highlights the complexities of India's agricultural policies and the challenges in achieving export targets while ensuring farmer welfare.


6. Consider the following statements regarding the "middle-income trap":

1.  The World Bank coined the term "middle-income trap" in 2007.
2.  The World Bank classifies economies with per capita GNI between US$1,135 and US$13,846 as MICs.
3.  India's per capita GDP is currently above US$13,846.
4.  The "3i strategy" proposed by the World Bank involves Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The World Bank did indeed coin the term "middle-income trap" around 2007, highlighting the challenge for rapidly growing economies to transition to high-income status.  Their classification of Middle-Income Countries (MICs) based on per capita Gross National Income (GNI) within the specified range is also accurate.  The World Bank's suggested "3i strategy" – Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation – is a widely discussed approach to escaping the middle-income trap. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's per capita GDP is significantly *below* US$13,846, placing it firmly within the MIC category. The inaccuracy in statement 3 serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of economic indicators.


7. Consider the following about Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF):

1.  From independence to economic liberalization, investment remained consistently above 10% of GDP.
2.  GFCF rose significantly in the 2000s, reaching approximately 27% of GDP in 2007-08.
3.  Private investment in GFCF has consistently increased since 2011-12.
4.  GFCF is also known as investment.

How many of the above statements regarding GFCF are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct.  GFCF did experience substantial growth in the 2000s, peaking around 27% of GDP in 2007-08.  The term GFCF is indeed synonymous with investment in the context of macroeconomic analysis. However, statement 1 is incorrect; investment fluctuated around 10% of GDP during the period from independence to economic liberalization, not consistently above it.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; private investment in GFCF *decreased* significantly from 2011-12 onwards, before showing a recent uptick.  The inclusion of these partially true, yet ultimately incorrect, statements makes this a challenging question, requiring careful attention to detail.


8. Consider the following about the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):

1.  Approximately 1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty.
2.  The MPI includes indicators related to education, health, and living standards.
3.  India introduced its National MPI (NMPI) in 2020.
4.  The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).

Which of the statements above are accurate regarding the MPI?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  Globally, approximately 1 billion people are estimated to be living in acute multidimensional poverty.  The MPI, both globally and in its national adaptations, includes indicators across education, health, and living standards. The NMPI in India does utilize data from the NFHS. However, statement 3 is incorrect; India's NMPI was introduced in 2021, not 2020.  The slight chronological inaccuracy makes this a more challenging question, testing the candidate's precise recall of dates and initiatives.  The inclusion of largely correct, yet slightly inaccurate information, enhances the difficulty level.


9. Consider the following initiatives related to India's dairy sector:

1.  "White Revolution 2.0" focuses on enhancing milk production through improved breeding practices.
2.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to improve the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds.
3.  The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) targets the eradication of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis.
4.  The Pandemic Fund Project focuses solely on enhancing vaccine manufacturing facilities.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives in India's dairy and animal husbandry sectors?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect ongoing initiatives in India's dairy and animal husbandry sectors. "White Revolution 2.0" aims to boost milk production through various means, including improved breeding and technological advancements. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission specifically targets the development and conservation of indigenous cattle breeds.  The NADCP is a significant program aimed at controlling and eradicating FMD and Brucellosis. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Pandemic Fund Project has a broader scope than just vaccine manufacturing; it encompasses enhancing surveillance, data management, and overall institutional capacity related to animal health security. The inclusion of a partially correct, but ultimately inaccurate statement, adds to the question's complexity.


10. Consider the following about the Preston Curve:

1.  It was first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975.
2.  It demonstrates a direct and proportional relationship between per capita income and life expectancy.
3.  It suggests that increases in per capita income always lead to significant increases in life expectancy.
4.  It highlights that beyond a certain point, increases in per capita income have diminishing returns on life expectancy.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the Preston Curve?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Preston Curve.  The curve was indeed first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975.  Importantly, it demonstrates that the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy is not linear; beyond a certain level of income, further increases have a diminishing impact on life expectancy.  This is because other factors, such as healthcare access and lifestyle choices, become more significant determinants of life expectancy at higher income levels.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect; the curve doesn't show a direct, proportional relationship, and income increases don't always lead to significant life expectancy increases beyond a certain point.  The inclusion of statements that are partially true but ultimately misrepresent the Preston Curve's core concept increases the question's difficulty.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Geographical Indications Act of 1999.
2.  UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage.
3.  The role of the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs.
4.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee's function.
5.  The National Monetisation Pipeline's objective.

How many of the above relate directly to government initiatives aimed at promoting economic growth or protecting traditional knowledge in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are directly related to government initiatives impacting the Indian economy. The Geographical Indications Act (1999) safeguards traditional knowledge associated with specific products, boosting their economic value. UNESCO's recognition of elements like Yoga as intangible cultural heritage promotes Indian culture globally, indirectly impacting tourism and related industries.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in shaping policies for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), a key driver of infrastructure development and economic growth. Finally, the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee and the National Monetisation Pipeline are both directly involved in facilitating investments and infrastructure projects, furthering economic progress.  Therefore, all four elements are directly linked to government initiatives focused on economic growth or the protection of traditional knowledge.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The KISAN initiative using space technology.
2.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform.
3.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC).
4.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism.
5.  India's Agricultural Export Policy.

How many of the above are primarily concerned with improving agricultural practices, data management, or market access for farmers in India?

Statement 2 is also correct as the text explicitly includes Payment System Participants and CICs within RBI's regulatory scope. Statement 4 is true; the RBI's authority extends to the management, governance, and winding-up processes of NBFCs. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The text specifies a maximum tenure of *three* years, not five, for RBI Ombudsmen. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

While a working group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006 initially identified the need, the model for an umbrella organization was indeed recommended by the Shri V.S. Das-led working group in 2009. Statement 3 is correct.  Providing liquidity and capital support and aiding UCBs in regulatory compliance are key functions of NUCFDC. Statement 4 is also correct. NUCFDC operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) to promote better governance and compliance within the UCB sector.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While a project aims to computerize 63,000 functional PACS,  the statement mentions a smaller number (18,000), making it a distractor. Statement 2 is correct. The NCD serves as a centralized repository of information on the cooperative sector. Statement 3 is correct. Initiatives are underway to enable PACS to engage in diverse activities, such as those related to dairy, fisheries, and floriculture, broadening their scope and impact. Statement 4 is incorrect. NCDC provides funding to both primary and secondary-level cooperative societies. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the initiatives.

(b) 2 and 3 only

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SROs must be not-for-profit companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013,  not for-profit. Statement 2 is correct. The framework mandates a minimum of one-third independent directors on the SRO board, including the chairperson. Statement 3 is correct. Developing compliance standards and surveillance mechanisms is a core function of SROs. Statement 4 is incorrect.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI recognized MFIN and Sa-Dhan in 2014, not 2015. The SHG-Bank Linkage Program's initiation year is correctly stated.  The Tarun Plus loan limit increase is to ₹20 lakh, not ₹15 lakh. The joint liability aspect of SHGs is accurate. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is partially correct, but requires significant clarification. The statement mentions that R&D expenditure in agriculture is a significant percentage of India's agricultural GDP. However, the source states that it is only 0.4%, which is not significant when compared to other countries. Statement 1 is incorrect; the contribution of agriculture and allied sectors was 18.2%, not over 25%. Statement 2 is false; the crop sub-sector's output declined, not increased. Statement 3 is also false; India's agricultural mechanization is lower than that of China and Brazil. Therefore, only one statement is partially correct, highlighting the need for careful consideration of numerical data.



**7. Consider the following about India's agricultural export policy:**

1. Agricultural exports in India witnessed significant growth in 2023-24.
2.  Rice is the least significant agricultural export from India.
3.  Vegetable oil is a major agricultural import for India.
4.  India's share in global agricultural exports is substantially higher than its share in global agricultural imports.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's agricultural export scenario?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are correct, but need clarification. Vegetable oil is indeed a major agricultural import for India. However, statement 1 is partially incorrect, agricultural exports registered a decline, not growth in 2023-24. Statement 2 is incorrect; rice is a significant export, constituting 21% of total exports. Statement 4 is false; India's share in global agricultural exports and imports are very close in 2022 (2.4% and 1.9% respectively).  Therefore, only two statements are partially correct, highlighting the importance of precise data interpretation.


**8. Consider the following about initiatives aimed at improving India's logistics sector:**

1. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 primarily focuses on hard infrastructure development.
2.  The Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) project has a planned investment of less than $5 billion.
3.  The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index is not a relevant metric for assessing logistics performance.
4.  The NLP 2022 includes a Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP).


How many of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives to improve India's logistics sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 4 and 1 are partially correct, but require clarification. The NLP 2022 does indeed include a CLAP, covering various action areas. However, statement 1 is partially incorrect as NLP also addresses soft infrastructure and logistics sector development aspects. Statement 2 is incorrect; the planned investment for MMLPs is $6.2 billion, not less than $5 billion. Statement 3 is false; the LEADS index is a crucial metric for evaluating state-level logistics performance.  Therefore, only two statements are partially correct, requiring careful examination of the details.


**9. Consider the following regarding India's port sector:**

1. Mormugao Port is the first port in India to introduce Green Ship Incentives.
2.  The Environmental Ship Index (ESI) is published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
3.  Dry ports only provide connectivity to seaports via rail.
4.  The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) ranked an Indian port as the top global container port in 2023.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's port sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct; Mormugao Port was indeed the first in India to introduce Green Ship Incentives through the ESI. Statement 2 is incorrect; the ESI is published by the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), not the IMO. Statement 3 is incorrect; dry ports can also provide connectivity via road. Statement 4 is false; while several Indian ports were ranked among the top 100, none were ranked as the top global container port in the CPPI 2023 (Yangshan Port, China held the top position). Therefore, only one statement accurately describes the Indian port sector.


**10. Consider the following about the development of new industrial nodes/cities in India:**

1. The project involves the development of fewer than 10 new industrial nodes/cities.
2.  These industrial areas will be located exclusively in northern and eastern states.
3. The new industrial cities will be developed as brownfield projects.
4. The 'plug-n-play' and 'walk-to-work' concepts will not be implemented.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the development of new industrial nodes/cities in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is incorrect. The plan involves the development of around 12 new industrial nodes/cities, not fewer than 10. Statement 2 is incorrect; the industrial areas will be spread across 10 states, not limited to northern and eastern states. Statement 3 is false; these will be greenfield smart cities, not brownfield projects. Statement 4 is also false; the 'plug-n-play' and 'walk-to-work' concepts are central to the development plan.  Therefore, only one statement is inaccurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF):**

1.  Banks and financial institutions provide loans up to ₹2 crores with a 3% interest subvention per annum.
2.  The scheme covers infrastructure creation under 'viable projects for building community farming assets'.
3.  Integrated primary and secondary processing projects are eligible activities under AIF.
4.  AIF credit guarantee coverage for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) is extended by NAB Sanrakshan.
5.  The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) is the sole provider of AIF credit guarantee coverage.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the AIF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all accurate descriptions of the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF).  The AIF indeed offers loans up to ₹2 crores with a 3% interest subvention, supports infrastructure development for community farming, includes integrated processing projects, and utilizes NAB Sanrakshan for credit guarantee coverage for FPOs.  Statement 5 is incorrect because while CGTMSE is involved, NAB Sanrakshan has also been included to broaden credit guarantee coverage, thus making it a dual provider.  Therefore, four statements accurately reflect the AIF's key features.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to India's agritech adoption:**

1.  FASAL Project: Provides early forecasts of crop output using space, agro-meteorology, and land-based observations.
2.  KISAN: Utilizes space technology and geoinformatics to improve yield estimation.
3.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX): A platform for farmer services, holding data on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown.
4.  Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC): A tech-driven solution using AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture.
5.  PM KUSUM: A solar power scheme focused on providing electricity to rural households.

How many of the above initiatives directly focus on improving agricultural data collection, analysis, or forecasting?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

FASAL, KISAN, ADeX, and Krishi ICCC all directly contribute to improving agricultural data collection, analysis, or forecasting.  FASAL provides early crop output forecasts, KISAN enhances yield estimation, ADeX offers a centralized data platform for farmer services, and Krishi ICCC uses technology for informed decision-making.  PM KUSUM, while important for rural electrification, is not directly focused on agricultural data management. Therefore, four of the listed initiatives directly support improved agricultural data-driven strategies.


**3. Consider the following statements about Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1.  MSP is the minimum rate at which farmers sell their crops to the government, preventing distress selling.
2.  MSP covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops.
3.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) makes the final decision.
4.  MSP is announced at the beginning of the harvesting season to provide timely support to farmers.
5.  Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the only central procuring agency for all MSP crops.

How many of these statements accurately describe the MSP mechanism in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the MSP system.  The MSP acts as a safety net against distress sales, covers a range of crops, and involves both the CACP for recommendations and the CCEA for final decisions. Statement 4 is incorrect because MSP is announced at the *beginning of the sowing season*, not the harvesting season, to help farmers plan their cropping. Statement 5 is also incorrect because while FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the *only* one for all MSP crops.  Other agencies also participate in procurement. Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate representations of the MSP system.



**4. Consider the following elements related to India's agricultural export policy:**

1.  A target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 was set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy.
2.  Agricultural exports experienced an 8% decline in 2023-24.
3.  The 2018 policy aimed to increase the share of processed agricultural products in total exports.
4.  The government provides export subsidies to support agricultural exports.
5.  All agricultural products are eligible for export incentives under the policy.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect aspects of India's agricultural export policy and its performance?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the stated goals and outcomes of India's agricultural export policy. The policy did set an ambitious target, exports did decline, and the policy aimed at promoting processed products. Statement 4 is partially true but misleading;  while some export support may exist, the policy does not explicitly rely on widespread export subsidies.  Statement 5 is also inaccurate, as not all agricultural products receive the same export incentives.  The policy has specific provisions and eligibility criteria.  Therefore, only three of the statements are entirely correct regarding the policy's intentions and actual performance.


**5. Consider the following regarding the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1.  Launched in 2021, it integrates infrastructure projects across various ministries.
2.  It utilizes GIS technology and satellite imagery for planning.
3.  Seven key infrastructure sectors are integrated within the plan's framework.
4.  The plan focuses solely on new infrastructure projects, excluding existing ones.
5.  The plan is implemented exclusively by the Ministry of Railways.


How many of the statements above accurately describe the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately represent the PM GatiShakti plan. It does integrate projects, uses GIS and satellite imagery, and covers seven key sectors.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the plan integrates *both* existing and planned projects to provide a holistic view of infrastructure development. Statement 5 is also incorrect, as the plan is a collaborative effort involving multiple ministries and agencies, not solely the Ministry of Railways.  Therefore, only three statements provide a correct depiction of the PM GatiShakti plan's features and implementation.


**6. Consider the following components of India's Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework:**

1.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for PPP policy.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising government assets.
4.  PPP projects are primarily funded through direct government grants.
5.  All PPP projects require foreign direct investment.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's PPP framework?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe elements of India's PPP framework. The Private Investment Unit sets policy, the Appraisal Committee evaluates projects, and the NMP seeks investment through asset monetisation. Statement 4 is incorrect; PPP projects typically involve a blend of public and private funding, not solely government grants.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; while foreign investment may be involved in some PPP projects, it is not a mandatory requirement for all projects.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the key elements of India's PPP framework.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999:**

1.  The Act guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific products.
2.  The Act provides legal protection for registered trademarks.
3.  UNESCO recognition of intangible cultural heritage is directly governed by the GI Act.
4.  The Act covers only agricultural products and handicrafts.
5.  The GI tag provides exclusive marketing rights to the registered entity.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the GI Act, 1999 and its implications?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 5 correctly reflect aspects of the GI Act. The Act does protect collective rights over traditional knowledge linked to products, and a GI tag does provide exclusive marketing rights to the registered entity.  Statement 2 is incorrect; trademark protection is a separate legal domain.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while UNESCO recognition is significant, it is a separate process from GI registration under the Indian Act. Statement 4 is inaccurate; GI tags can be obtained for various products, not just agricultural and handicrafts. Therefore, only two of the statements accurately describe the GI Act and its functions.



**8. Consider the following aspects of India's microfinance sector:**

1.  The Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) Bank, established in 1974, was India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI).
2.  Microfinance loans are defined as collateral-free loans to low-income households.
3.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for MFIs in India.
4.  Microfinance institutions typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.
5.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans.


How many of the above statements correctly describe features of India's microfinance sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of India's microfinance sector. SEWA Bank was indeed a pioneer, microfinance loans are largely collateral-free for low-income groups, and the RBI regulates MFIs. Statement 4 is incorrect; MFIs often charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks due to higher risk profiles. Statement 5 is also incorrect; PMMY is a broader scheme supporting small and micro-enterprises, not exclusively providing microfinance loans.  Therefore, only three statements correctly portray the features of India's microfinance landscape.


**9. Consider the following regarding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monitors the capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs.
2.  Financially unsound UCBs can be placed under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA).
3.  A UCB exits PCA if it maintains healthy financial indicators for two consecutive quarters.
4.  All UCBs are automatically placed under PCA if they experience a decline in profits.
5.  The RBI’s role in monitoring UCBs is primarily advisory and not regulatory.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the RBI's oversight of UCBs?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the RBI's role in overseeing UCBs.  The RBI does monitor key financial indicators and can place underperforming UCBs under PCA.  Statement 3 is partially correct but the condition is for four successive quarters, not two. Statement 4 is incorrect; PCA implementation is based on multiple risk indicators, not just profit decline. Statement 5 is incorrect; the RBI’s role is both regulatory and supervisory, not solely advisory.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the RBI’s oversight mechanisms for UCBs.


**10. Consider the following related to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India:**

1.  The FI-Index measures the extent of financial inclusion across the country.
2.  The index has a range from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial inclusion.
3.  The index includes parameters related to banking, investments, insurance, and pensions.
4.  The index is published quarterly by the Ministry of Finance.
5.  A higher FI-Index score always indicates improved access to formal financial services.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the FI-Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the FI-Index.  It measures financial inclusion, has a 0-100 range, and covers multiple financial sectors. Statement 4 is incorrect; the index is published *annually*, not quarterly, by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Ministry of Finance. Statement 5 is partially true but oversimplified; while a higher score generally suggests better access, other factors can influence the interpretation.  Therefore, only three statements provide a fully accurate picture of the FI-Index.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India:

1.  It is published biannually by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The index uses a single value ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing complete financial inclusion.
3.  Access, Usage, and Quality are the three broad parameters considered, with Usage having the highest weightage.
4.  The FI-Index incorporates data from the banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published *annually*, not biannually, by the RBI.  Statement 2 is correct. The FI-Index indeed uses a single-value scale from 0 to 100, where 100 signifies complete financial inclusion. Statement 3 is also correct. The three broad parameters are Access, Usage, and Quality, with Usage carrying the highest weightage (45%).  Statement 4 is accurate; the index encompasses data across the specified sectors, providing a holistic view of financial inclusion. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


2. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS):

1.  It was launched in 2022 as a part of the RBI's Alternate Grievance Redressal (AGR) Framework.
2.  It is established under the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.
3.  The scheme aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints related to services provided by RBI-regulated entities.
4.  It covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), irrespective of their asset size.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RB-IOS is established under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; the RBI Act, 1934; and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, not the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's primary objective is to provide a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer grievances. Statement 4 is incorrect. The scheme does *not* cover all NBFCs; it specifically excludes Housing Finance Companies and only covers those with assets of ₹100 crore and above.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


3. Consider the following statements related to India's minimum wage system:

1.  The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, specifies the exact minimum wage for all occupations across all states.
2.  The Code on Wages, passed in 2019, aims to establish a universal minimum wage floor applicable to all states upon implementation.
3.  Wage payment discrepancies are absent due to the robust enforcement of the national wage floor across all states.
4.  India currently follows a "living wage" system, ensuring that wages meet the cost of living.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, provides guidelines but *does not* specify a precise minimum wage for all occupations nationwide.  Statement 2 is correct. The Code on Wages aims to establish a universal minimum wage, although its complete implementation across states is still pending. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Significant wage payment discrepancies persist due to the lack of consistent enforcement of a national wage floor. Statement 4 is incorrect.  India currently follows a minimum wage system, not a living wage system.  A living wage is a significantly higher standard that aims to cover the cost of living, which is not currently mandated.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


4. Consider the following about Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) in India:

1.  IRDAI designates D-SIIs based solely on their asset size.
2.  The distress or failure of a D-SII would have minimal impact on the domestic financial system.
3.  Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has been identified as a D-SII.
4.  D-SIIs are insurers whose size, market importance, and interconnectedness are such that their failure could significantly disrupt the domestic financial system.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IRDAI's designation of D-SIIs considers factors beyond just asset size, including market importance and interconnectedness. Statement 2 is incorrect. The failure of a D-SII would indeed cause a significant dislocation within the domestic financial system, justifying their identification and enhanced regulatory oversight. Statement 3 is correct. LIC is among the insurers identified as a D-SII by IRDAI. Statement 4 accurately defines D-SIIs, emphasizing their systemic importance and the potential consequences of their failure.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


5. Consider the following statements concerning Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:

1.  All collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000 are classified as microfinance loans.
2.  MFIs typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.
3.  The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs operating in India.
4.  The Malegam Committee's recommendations (2010) focused on regulating NBFC-MFIs.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The income limit for loans considered microfinance is *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it. Statement 2 is incorrect. MFIs generally charge *higher*, not lower, interest rates than commercial banks due to the higher risk involved in lending to low-income borrowers. Statement 3 is correct. The RBI is the primary regulatory authority for MFIs in India. Statement 4 is also correct. The Malegam Committee's report significantly contributed to the regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


6. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY):

1.  It provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to corporate and farm-related small/micro enterprises.
2.  Loans under PMMY are categorized into ‘Shishu’, ‘Kishore’, and ‘Tarun’ based on loan amount.
3.  The 2024 Union Budget reduced the maximum loan limit under PMMY.
4.  PMMY aims to provide financial inclusion and support to marginalized socio-economic groups.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to *non-corporate* and *non-farm* small/micro enterprises. Statement 2 is correct. The loan categories reflect the stage of growth and funding needs of borrowers. Statement 3 is incorrect. The 2024 Union Budget *increased* the maximum loan limit, introducing a "Tarun Plus" category. Statement 4 is correct. The scheme's primary goal is to enhance financial inclusion and support for marginalized communities.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


7. Consider the following about Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):

1.  An NPA is a loan overdue for more than 180 days.
2.  Gross NPAs (GNPAs) represent the sum of all loan assets classified as NPAs.
3.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, is irrelevant to NPA resolution.
4.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, empowers secured creditors to take possession of collateral in case of loan defaults.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An NPA is overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days. Statement 2 is correct. GNPA accurately reflects the total value of NPAs. Statement 3 is incorrect. The IBC, 2016, plays a crucial role in resolving stressed assets and NPAs, especially for corporate debtors. Statement 4 is correct. The SARFAESI Act provides a legal framework for secured creditors to recover dues through the seizure of collateral. Therefore, three statements are correct.


8. Consider the following statements related to the Financial Stability Report (FSR):

1.  The FSR is published annually by the Ministry of Finance.
2.  It assesses the health of the Indian financial system based on inputs from the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC).
3.  The FSR's assessment is solely based on data from Scheduled Commercial Banks.
4.  The FSDC is chaired by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FSR is published *biannually*, not annually, by the RBI. Statement 2 is correct. The FSR's assessment relies heavily on the FSDC's sub-committee's analysis. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the FSR analyzes Scheduled Commercial Banks, it also considers data from other financial institutions to provide a comprehensive overview. Statement 4 is incorrect. The FSDC is chaired by the *Finance Minister*, not the RBI Governor. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


9. Consider the following regarding the  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India:

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce government spending on infrastructure projects.
2. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs handles policy-level matters related to PPPs.
3. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
4. The World Bank’s Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report assesses PPP regulatory landscapes globally.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP aims to *generate investment* by monetising existing government assets, not to reduce government spending.  Statement 2 is correct. The Private Investment Unit plays a key role in PPP policy. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects. Statement 4 is correct. The World Bank report indeed benchmarks PPP regulatory frameworks across many economies. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


10. Consider the following regarding Co-lending in India:

1.  Co-lending involves a single lender providing loans to borrowers.
2.  Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.
3.  Co-lending helps increase lending capacity and reduce risk for individual lenders.
4.  As per RBI guidelines, banks must bear at least 80% of the credit risk in co-lending arrangements with NBFCs.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Co-lending involves *multiple* lenders, not a single lender. Statement 2 is incorrect. Banks are *not* allowed to co-lend with NBFCs from their promoter group. Statement 3 is correct. Co-lending effectively diversifies risk and expands lending capacity. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The minimum credit risk for NBFCs is 20%, meaning banks bear at least 80%, not the other way around. Therefore, only two statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements related to seaweed farming in India:**

1. Seaweed cultivation contributes significantly to India's GDP, exceeding 5%.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims for 2 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025.
3.  The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) has pioneered offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region.
4. A GIS-based portal is under development to map seaweed cultivation sites nationwide.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. NIOT, through its Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (ACOSTI), has indeed initiated offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region.  Statement 4 is also correct; the development of a GIS-based portal for mapping seaweed cultivation sites is underway.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The fishing and aquaculture sector, which includes seaweed farming, contributes only 1.5% to India's GDP, not a significantly higher percentage.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana targets 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025, not 2 million tons.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following aspects of India's silk production:**

1. India holds the top position globally in silk production.
2. Andhra Pradesh is the leading state in silk production in India.
3. India produces all four major varieties of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.
4. The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its diamond jubilee.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: India does indeed produce all four varieties of silk mentioned. Statement 1 is incorrect; India is the second-largest silk producer globally, not the largest.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Karnataka, not Andhra Pradesh, is the leading state in silk production in India. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Central Silk Board celebrated its platinum jubilee, not its diamond jubilee. Therefore, only one statement is factually accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs):**

1. DFCs aim to reduce the share of rail freight traffic to 20% by 2030.
2. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) was incorporated in 2008.
3.  DFCs are a key component of the National Rail Plan 2030.
4. The construction of DFCs is entirely funded by private investment.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: DFCs are indeed integral to the National Rail Plan 2030, aiming to significantly increase the share of rail freight traffic. Statement 1 is incorrect. The aim is to *increase* the share of rail freight traffic to 45% by 2030, not decrease it. Statement 2 is also incorrect; DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006, not 2008. Statement 4 is incorrect; while private investment might play a role, DFC construction is primarily undertaken by DFCCIL, a special purpose vehicle of Indian Railways.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**4. Consider the following initiatives related to India's agriculture sector:**

1. The KISAN initiative utilizes satellite imagery for crop yield estimation.
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is India's second data exchange platform for farmer services.
3. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre employs AI and remote sensing technologies.
4.  The Government's target for creating digital farmer identities is 15 crore farmers over three years.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. KISAN does use space technology for yield estimation, and the Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre utilizes AI and remote sensing. However, statement 2 is incorrect; ADeX is India's *first* such platform, not the second. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the target is 11 crore farmers, not 15 crore.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about India's Minimum Support Price (MSP):**

1. MSP covers a total of 25 agricultural crops.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) determines the MSP for all crops.
3.  The MSP is announced at the end of the sowing season.
4. Food Corporation of India is the primary procuring agency for all MSP crops.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CACP does recommend MSPs, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs takes the final decision (Statement 2).  However, statement 1 is incorrect; MSP covers 22 crops, not 25. Statement 3 is incorrect; MSP is announced *before* the sowing season begins. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the FCI is a major procuring agency, it's not the sole agency for *all* MSP crops. Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**6. Consider the following related to India's logistics sector:**

1. India aims to be among the top 15 countries in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) by 2030.
2. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 focuses primarily on hard infrastructure development.
3. The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report assesses PPP regulatory landscapes globally.
4.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) are planned with an investment outlay of $5 billion.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct; the World Bank report does assess global PPP regulatory landscapes. However, statement 1 is incorrect; India aims to be among the top 25, not top 15, countries in the LPI by 2030. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NLP 2022 addresses both soft and hard infrastructure aspects. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the planned investment outlay for MMLPs is $6.2 billion, not $5 billion. Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**7. Consider the following about India's steel sector:**

1. India's per capita steel consumption surpasses the global average.
2.  The government has set a target of 600 million tonnes of steel production by 2034.
3. The steel industry is a significant contributor to India's carbon emissions.
4. India primarily sources its coking coal domestically.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The steel industry is indeed a major emitter of carbon dioxide.  Statement 1 is incorrect; India's per capita steel consumption is lower than the global average. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the target is 500 million tonnes, not 600 million tonnes. Statement 4 is incorrect; India largely relies on imports for its coking coal needs.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding India's offshore mineral exploration:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including hydrocarbons.
2. India's EEZ contains significant reserves of rare earth elements.
3. Geological Survey of India has identified substantial offshore deposits of diamonds.
4. The rules mandate the use of the UNFC classification system for exploration stages.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is partially correct.  India's EEZ does hold potential rare earth element reserves, but the extent of these reserves is still under exploration and not definitively established as "substantial."  Statement 1 is incorrect; the rules exclude mineral oils and hydrocarbons. Statement 3 is incorrect; while there might be potential for diamond deposits, the GSI has not identified "substantial" deposits. Statement 4 is correct; the rules do indeed utilize a modified version of the UNFC classification. Therefore, only one statement is definitively and completely correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1. The PM GatiShakti initiative is driven by 8 engines.
2. The Digital Master Planning tool uses a proprietary GIS platform.
3.  It integrates data from various ministries, including those related to inland waterways.
4. The plan is hosted on a private cloud infrastructure.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The Master Plan does integrate data from various ministries, including those overseeing inland waterways. Statement 1 is incorrect; the initiative is driven by 7 engines, not 8. Statement 2 is incorrect; the tool utilizes an open-source GIS platform. Statement 4 is incorrect; the plan is hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**10. Consider the following statements about India’s technical textiles sector:**

1. India is the third-largest technical textiles market globally.
2. The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to make India a global leader in this sector.
3. Several central ministries are mandated to use only technical textiles.
4. The government has introduced a PLI scheme specifically for technical textiles.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The National Technical Textiles Mission indeed aims for global leadership, and a PLI scheme exists to boost the sector. However, statement 1 is incorrect; India is the fifth-largest market, not the third-largest. Statement 3 is also not entirely accurate; while several ministries are encouraged to use technical textiles, it's not a complete mandate for *all* their needs.  Therefore, only two statements are completely correct.



**1. Consider the following statements related to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF):**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership focused solely on poverty reduction in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
2.  The EIF's primary mechanism involves direct financial aid to LDCs.
3. The World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO) are among the organizations supporting the EIF.
4. The EIF Trust Fund is managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While poverty reduction is a key objective of the EIF, it also aims to use trade as an engine for growth and sustainable development in LDCs.  The EIF's focus is broader than solely poverty reduction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF doesn't provide direct financial aid. Instead, it assists LDCs in leveraging trade for growth, which might involve supporting projects or providing technical assistance, but not direct financial disbursements in the manner of a typical aid program.

Statement 3 is correct. The World Bank and WTO are indeed among the international organizations supporting the EIF. Their involvement reflects the multi-faceted nature of the EIF’s approach to development.

Statement 4 is correct. The UNOPS manages the EIF Trust Fund, demonstrating the involvement of the UN system in this multilateral partnership.

Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are entirely correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN):**

1. It was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
2. It replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
3.  It is primarily funded through a levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees.
4. Its primary aim is to fund telecom infrastructure projects in metropolitan areas.

How many of the statements accurately describe the DBN?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, not the older Indian Telegraph Act.  This highlights a significant shift in the regulatory framework for telecom in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The DBN replaced the USOF, indicating a change in the mechanism for funding telecom development in underserved areas.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While the USOF was funded through a levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees, the exact mechanism for DBN funding may differ, although it's likely to involve similar principles of revenue generation.  The question uses misleading phrasing.


Statement 4 is incorrect. The DBN's focus is on underserved, remote, and rural areas, not metropolitan areas, reflecting a policy priority towards bridging the digital divide in India.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are substantially correct (with a caveat on statement 3's phrasing).


**3. Consider the following aspects of the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR):**

1. It is established as a public sector undertaking.
2. It is provisionally named the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).
3. Its creation was proposed in the 2021-22 budget.
4. It operates under the ambit of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.


Which of the above statements regarding the NCoE for AVGC-XR are accurate?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE for AVGC-XR is set up as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, which is a type of non-profit organization, not a public sector undertaking. This reflects a shift towards private sector participation in this area.

Statement 2 is correct. The provisional name for the NCoE is indeed the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).

Statement 3 is incorrect. The creation of the AVGC task force and, subsequently, the NCoE, was proposed in the 2022-23 budget, not the 2021-22 budget. This is a minor but important factual detail.

Statement 4 is not explicitly stated in the provided text and is therefore considered incorrect. While the ministry responsible may be inferred, it is not explicitly provided.


Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the UN Global Tax Treaty:**

1.  It aims to create a universally applicable tax rate for multinational corporations (MNCs).
2.  Developing countries, including India, largely supported the treaty's terms of reference.
3.  The OECD Global Minimum Tax is a direct precursor to the UN Global Tax Treaty.
4. The United States voted in favor of the treaty's terms of reference.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the UN Global Tax Treaty initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to establish a more legitimate, fair, stable, inclusive, and effective international tax system, but it doesn't mandate a specific, universally applicable tax rate for MNCs.  The treaty focuses on principles rather than specific tax rates.

Statement 2 is correct. Developing nations largely supported the treaty's terms of reference, highlighting a significant global divide on international taxation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While both initiatives address international taxation and tax avoidance, the OECD Global Minimum Tax is a separate, parallel initiative, not a direct precursor to the UN treaty.  They are distinct but related efforts.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that industrialized nations such as the USA voted *against* the treaty's terms of reference. This opposition reflects differing national interests and approaches to global tax governance.

Therefore, only statements 2 is correct.


**5. Consider the following elements related to Duty Drawback:**

1. It is governed by Section 75 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
2. It is administered by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
3. It rebates customs duty on imported materials used in export goods.
4. It aims to reduce the cost of production for domestic goods.

How many of the statements correctly describe the Duty Drawback mechanism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Duty Drawback is governed by Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, not the Income Tax Act.  This highlights the distinct legal frameworks governing customs and taxation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Duty Drawback is administered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), not the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).  The CBIC handles indirect taxes, while the CBDT handles direct taxes. This is a crucial distinction.

Statement 3 is correct.  Duty Drawback rebates customs duty paid on imported materials used in manufacturing export goods. This is a key feature designed to support exports.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Duty Drawback specifically aims to reduce the cost of *export* goods, not domestic goods. The focus is on enhancing competitiveness in international markets.

Therefore, only statements 3 is correct.


**6. Consider the following about the Windfall Tax:**

1. It is imposed only on domestically produced crude oil.
2. It's a tax levied on exceptionally high profits due to favorable market conditions.
3. It is primarily aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit.
4. It is a permanent feature of the Indian tax system.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Windfall Tax?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the example given in the text mentions crude oil, windfall taxes can be, and have been, applied to other sectors experiencing unexpectedly high profits. The scope of windfall taxes is not limited to a single commodity.

Statement 2 is correct. Windfall taxes target industries benefiting from unusually favorable circumstances, capturing some of those excess profits.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While reducing the fiscal deficit might be a government's goal in implementing a windfall tax, it is not the sole or primary aim.  Other objectives might include revenue generation or regulating specific sectors.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Windfall taxes are often temporary measures, adjusted based on market conditions and government policy. They are not permanent fixtures of the tax system.

Therefore, only statement 2 is completely accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP):**

1. It was launched in 2023.
2. It aims to reduce the World Bank's overall lending to developing countries.
3. It consolidates guarantee products from various World Bank Group institutions.
4. It primarily focuses on providing guarantees for agricultural projects.


Which of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the WBG-GP?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP was initiated in 2024, not 2023. This is a factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WBG-GP aims to *increase* the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance, not reduce it.  The goal is to expand the reach of guarantees to support more projects.

Statement 3 is correct. The platform consolidates guarantee products and expertise from across the World Bank Group institutions under MIGA. This improves efficiency and coordination.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the WBG provides guarantees for various projects, it is not solely focused on agricultural projects. The scope is much broader, encompassing infrastructure and other sectors.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the Marrakesh Agreement:**

1. It established the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994.
2. It replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
3. It focused exclusively on trade in manufactured goods.
4. It was signed in Marrakech, Morocco.

How many of these statements accurately describe the Marrakesh Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Marrakesh Agreement led to the formation of the WTO in 1995, not 1994. The agreement itself was signed in 1994, but the WTO's formal establishment came a year later.

Statement 2 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement replaced GATT as the primary international trade body. This marked a significant shift in global trade governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Marrakesh Agreement expanded the scope of international trade rules beyond manufactured goods, including services, intellectual property, and more.  It is a more comprehensive agreement than its predecessor.

Statement 4 is correct. The agreement was indeed signed in Marrakech, Morocco, giving it its name.

Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are entirely correct, while statement 1 is largely correct (with the exception of the year) and statement 3 is incorrect.  The question plays with near-correct options and incorrect options.


**9. Consider the following elements related to the WTO's Public Stockholding (PSH) policy:**

1. It allows governments to procure crops at below-market prices.
2. It involves the storage and distribution of food grains to the poor.
3. De minimis limits restrict the value of government procurement subsidies.
4.  Developed countries generally support increasing the de minimis limits.

How many of the above statements correctly characterize the WTO's PSH policy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PSH policy allows governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSP), which are typically *at or above* market prices, not below.  The question uses misleading language.

Statement 2 is correct. PSH involves government procurement, storage, and distribution of food grains to vulnerable populations.

Statement 3 is correct. De minimis limits are indeed used to restrict the amount of subsidies that governments can provide for agricultural procurement.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Developed countries generally *oppose* increasing the de minimis limits, as they view higher subsidies as market-distorting.  Developing countries typically advocate for higher limits.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the PSH policy.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC):**

1. It functions under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
2. It is responsible for collecting Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST).
3. It is responsible for administering direct tax laws.
4. It deals with the prevention of smuggling.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the CBIC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBIC functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. This is a key distinction in the Indian government's organizational structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBIC is responsible for the collection of CGST, along with other indirect taxes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CBIC handles indirect taxes, while direct tax administration falls under the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).  The question tests the understanding of the division of responsibilities between these two boards.

Statement 4 is correct.  The CBIC has a crucial role in preventing smuggling, a key aspect of customs administration.

Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are correct.  The question uses similar-sounding entities to create confusion.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)
2.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)
3.  The National Centre of Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR)
4.  The Global Innovation Index (GII)
5.  The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS)
6.  Vadhvan Port

How many of the above are initiatives or programs related to economic development or infrastructure in India or globally?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six elements listed are related to economic development or infrastructure.  The EIF focuses on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to use trade for growth and poverty reduction, thus directly impacting economic development on a global scale. The DBN funds telecom schemes in underserved areas in India, contributing to infrastructure development and bridging the digital divide. The AVGC-XR initiative aims to boost India's animation and related industries, fostering economic growth. The GII is a global ranking system assessing innovation, a key driver of economic progress.  RELOS is a logistics agreement focused on military cooperation between India and Russia, indirectly supporting economic ties through enhanced defense collaboration and logistics efficiency. Finally, Vadhvan Port is a major infrastructure project in India, aimed at boosting container handling and maritime trade. Therefore, all six are relevant to economic development and/or infrastructure.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
2.  The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
3.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023
4.  The Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR)
5.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)

How many of the above are directly or indirectly involved in the regulation or funding of telecommunications in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five elements are connected to the regulation or funding of telecommunications in India. The USOF was a fund specifically created for providing telecom services in underserved areas, a key aspect of telecom regulation.  The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, was the foundational legislation governing telecommunications before its replacement. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, is the current overarching law regulating the sector and established the DBN. AGR is a crucial metric used to calculate license fees and levies contributing to the USOF and impacting telecom companies' financial obligations.  NPCI, although not directly a regulatory body, plays a vital role in the financial infrastructure supporting telecommunication services through UPI and other payment systems. Therefore, all five entities are directly or indirectly involved in the Indian telecom landscape.


**3. Consider the following statements related to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI):**

1.  Aadhaar
2.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
3.  DigiLocker
4.  The One Future Alliance
5.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)
6.  The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)

How many of the above are components, initiatives, or partnerships concerning the development or global advancement of India's DPI?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six elements are integral to India's DPI or its global promotion. Aadhaar, UPI, and DigiLocker are core components of India's DPI, forming its identity, payment, and data governance layers. The One Future Alliance, GDPIR, and the EU TTC are all initiatives or partnerships actively promoting the adoption and development of DPI in other countries, particularly low- and middle-income ones.  These represent India's efforts to share its DPI model globally.  Therefore, all six are directly linked to India's DPI and its international outreach.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
2.  The Global Innovation Index (GII)
3.  The International Intellectual Property (IP) Index
4.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge
5.  The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)
6.  The Geographical Indications Act 1999

How many of the above are related to intellectual property rights, traditional knowledge protection, or innovation rankings?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six elements are directly involved in intellectual property, traditional knowledge, or innovation. WIPO is a leading international organization in intellectual property rights. The GII and the International IP Index are both ranking systems assessing innovation and IP protection levels in countries. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge is a specific agreement aimed at harmonizing intellectual property with traditional knowledge protection. TKDL is a digital library to safeguard India's traditional knowledge, preventing biopiracy. The Geographical Indications Act 1999 protects the rights of producers of goods with specific geographical origins, a form of intellectual property protection.  Therefore, all six elements are relevant to the stated themes.

1.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)
2.  Bharatmala Pariyojana
3.  Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)
4.  Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP)
5.  PM GatiShakti
6.  The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS)

How many of the above are primarily focused on improving India's logistics infrastructure or efficiency?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Five of the listed initiatives directly target logistics infrastructure or efficiency improvements in India. MMLPs, Bharatmala Pariyojana, DFCs, LEEP, and PM GatiShakti are all programs aimed at upgrading and streamlining India's logistics network, from road and rail infrastructure to integrated planning and digital platforms. RELOS, while relevant to logistics, primarily focuses on military cooperation and access to logistics facilities between India and Russia, making it distinct from the other purely infrastructural and efficiency-oriented initiatives.  Therefore, five of the options are directly related to improving India's domestic logistics sector.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
2.  The General Resources Account (GRA)
3.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT)
4.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST)
5.  The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP)
6.  The World Bank

How many of the above are international financial institutions or lending mechanisms?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six entities are international financial institutions or related lending mechanisms. The IMF and the World Bank are two of the most prominent multilateral development banks. The GRA, PRGT, and RST are all lending instruments utilized by the IMF to provide financial assistance to member countries under different conditions and interest rates.  The WBG-GP is a specific platform established within the World Bank Group to streamline its guarantee products and enhance its lending capacity.  Therefore, all six items fall under the category of international financial institutions or mechanisms related to financing and development.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies
2.  Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT)
3.  The "polluter pays principle" (PPP)
4.  "common but differentiated responsibilities" (CBDR-RC)
5.  The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)
6.  The World Trade Organization (WTO)

How many of the above are related to international trade agreements, principles, or organizations?


(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six elements pertain to international trade agreements, principles, or organizations. The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies is a specific WTO agreement. S&DT is a principle within the WTO framework acknowledging the differing capabilities and needs of developing countries.  The PPP and CBDR-RC are principles frequently invoked in international environmental and development discussions, often influencing trade negotiations. The TRIPS Agreement is a major WTO agreement on intellectual property rights, significantly impacting international trade.  The WTO itself is the primary international organization governing global trade rules.  Therefore, all six are intrinsically linked to the world of international trade governance and agreements.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)
2.  The Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
3.  The Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry
4.  Navratna status
5.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA)
6.  Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI)

How many of the above are related to the measurement of industrial performance, government designations, or specific public sector undertakings in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six elements are connected to either the measurement of industrial performance, government designations (like Navratna status), or specific public sector undertakings (PSUs) in India. The ICI and IIP are key economic indicators measuring industrial output. The Office of the Economic Adviser is the government body responsible for releasing these indices.  Navratna status is a government designation given to high-performing PSUs. IREDA and SECI are two specific PSUs that have recently received this Navratna status. Therefore, all six elements are relevant to the Indian economic context and government policies related to industries and PSUs.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. It is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  Its core component is the Gender Inequality Index (GII).
3.  It primarily focuses on economic growth indicators.
4.  The Human Development Index (HDI) was developed by Amartya Sen.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement that the HDR is released annually by the World Bank is incorrect; it is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  The statement that its core component is the Gender Inequality Index (GII) is also incorrect; the core component is the Human Development Index (HDI). The statement that it primarily focuses on economic growth indicators is incorrect; while economic factors are considered, the HDR takes a broader view, encompassing social and environmental factors in its assessment of human development. The statement that the HDI was developed by Amartya Sen is incorrect; it was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq. Therefore, three out of the four statements are incorrect.


**2. Consider the following indices related to human development:**

1. Gender Development Index (GDI)
2. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)
3. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
4. Planetary Pressures-adjusted Human Development Index

Which of the above indices are primarily developed and published by the UNDP?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Development Index (GDI), the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), and the Planetary Pressures-adjusted Human Development Index are all developed and published by the UNDP.  The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), while related to human development, is jointly published by the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.

1. It was launched in 2000.
2.  It considers deprivations in education, health, and living standards.
3.  A person is considered MPI poor if deprived in less than one-third of the weighted indicators.
4.  It directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the MPI was launched in 2010, not 2000. Statement 2 is correct:  The MPI considers deprivations across these sectors. Statement 3 is incorrect; a person is considered MPI poor if deprived in *one-third or more* of the weighted indicators. Statement 4 is incorrect; it advances Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty), not Goal 2. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**5. Consider the following aspects of India's National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI):**

1. It was introduced in 2020 by the Ministry of Rural Development.
2. It uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS).
3. It includes indicators on maternal health and bank accounts.
4. The NMPI value is calculated using the headcount ratio and the intensity of poverty.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NMPI was introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, not the Ministry of Rural Development in 2020. Statement 2 is incorrect; it uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the NSS. Statement 3 is correct: Maternal health and bank accounts are included as additional indicators. Statement 4 is correct: The NMPI value is calculated using these two metrics.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following statements related to the "polycrisis" concept:**

1. The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the polycrisis in its recent report.
2.  It refers to a simultaneous occurrence of multiple economic and social crises.

4.  The polycrisis has significantly impacted global poverty reduction efforts in recent years.

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the World Bank, not the WHO, highlighted the polycrisis. Statement 2 is correct: The polycrisis involves multiple interconnected crises. Statement 3 is correct: The prosperity gap, representing the income disparity needed to achieve a certain prosperity level, is a key aspect. Statement 4 is correct: The polycrisis has negatively impacted global poverty reduction.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's Minimum Support Price (MSP):**

1. MSP is determined solely by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.
2.  It covers only Kharif crops.
3.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) plays a role in recommending MSPs.
4.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency for all MSP crops.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CACP recommends MSPs, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs takes the final decision. Statement 2 is incorrect; MSP covers Kharif, Rabi, and some commercial crops. Statement 3 is correct: The CACP plays a crucial role in the MSP determination process. Statement 4 is incorrect; while FCI is a major procuring agency, it's not the sole agency for all MSP crops.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**8. Consider the following about India's Agricultural Export Policy:**

1. It aimed for agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2023.
2.  Agricultural exports in 2023-24 exceeded the target set by the policy.
3.  The policy was launched in 2018.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the PLFS was launched in 2017. Statement 2 is correct: It estimates key employment and unemployment indicators. Statement 3 is incorrect; the unemployment rate in 2023 was lower than the global average. Statement 4 is correct; the NSO collects PLFS data. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**13. Consider the following concerning Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not regulate UCBs.
2.  Capital adequacy is not a key monitoring area for UCBs.
3.  A UCB can be placed under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) for financial unsoundness.
4.  Exiting PCA requires consistent adherence to risk thresholds over four consecutive quarters.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

Statement 1 is incorrect; the RBI regulates UCBs. Statement 2 is incorrect; capital adequacy is a key monitoring area. Statement 3 is correct:  Financial unsoundness can lead to PCA. Statement 4 is correct:  Consistent adherence to risk thresholds is required for exiting PCA. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**14. Consider the following regarding microfinance in India:**

1. The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank was established in 1984.
2.  Microfinance loans are always collateral-based.
3.  Microfinance institutions typically charge lower interest rates than commercial banks.
4.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides microfinance loans.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SEWA Bank was established in 1974. Statement 2 is incorrect; microfinance loans are typically collateral-free. Statement 3 is incorrect; MFIs usually charge higher interest rates. Statement 4 is correct; PMMY provides loans to micro and small enterprises, which can be considered a form of microfinance.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
2.  The Human Development Index (HDI)
3.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII)
4.  The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)

How many of the above are indices used to measure aspects of human development, either globally or specifically in relation to gender inequality?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four indices listed are used to measure different aspects of human development. The Global MPI focuses on multidimensional poverty, encompassing factors beyond income. The HDI is a composite index measuring life expectancy, education, and per capita income. The GII assesses gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation. Finally, the IHDI adjusts the HDI to account for inequalities within a population.  Therefore, all four are relevant to measuring human development, making (d) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of these important indices.  Understanding these different indices and their applications is crucial for analyzing development trends and formulating effective policies.  UPSC often tests knowledge of these development indicators and their comparative strengths and weaknesses.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data is used.
2.  It includes indicators related to maternal health.
3.  It aims to measure poverty in all its forms.
4.  It was introduced in 2010.

How many of the above statements accurately describe India's National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NMPI uses NFHS data (statement 1 is correct), and it incorporates maternal health as an indicator (statement 2 is correct). However, the NMPI's goal is to measure multidimensional poverty, not poverty "in all its forms" (statement 3 is inaccurate, as it's a specific type of poverty measure).  Furthermore, the NMPI was introduced in 2021, not 2010 (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the NMPI. The other options incorrectly overestimate or underestimate the number of accurate statements.  Understanding the nuances of poverty measurement indices, like the difference between MPI and other poverty lines, is a critical aspect of development economics that UPSC frequently assesses.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  It is released annually by the UNDP.
2.  It includes the Human Development Index (HDI).
3.  It primarily focuses on economic growth rates.
4.  It was first published in 1990.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Human Development Report (HDR)?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The HDR is indeed released annually by the UNDP (statement 1 is correct), and it prominently features the HDI as its core metric (statement 2 is correct).  However, the HDR's scope extends far beyond just economic growth rates; it examines a broader range of human development factors (statement 3 is incorrect). The first HDR was published in 1990 (statement 4 is correct). Thus, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect information regarding the HDR's focus and timeline.  A thorough understanding of the HDR and its significance for development policy is expected in UPSC examinations.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  It aims to expand oil palm cultivation.
2.  It focuses on seed components like breeding and distribution.
3.  It primarily targets wheat and rice production.
4.  It was launched in 2010.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NMEO-OP does aim to significantly expand oil palm cultivation in India (statement 1 is correct). It also addresses seed components such as breeding and distribution to improve oilseed production (statement 2 is correct). However, the NMEO-OP does not primarily target wheat and rice; its focus is on edible oils (statement 3 is incorrect).  Additionally, the NMEO-OP was launched in 2021-22, not 2010 (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the NMEO-OP's objectives and timeline. The other options misrepresent the mission's key goals and chronology.  UPSC questions on agricultural policies often require specific knowledge of individual schemes and their implementation details.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a data exchange platform for farmer services.
2.  It includes data on farmer identity and geotagged farm locations.
3.  It was launched to improve crop insurance schemes.
4.  It primarily focuses on livestock management.

How many of the following statements accurately describe the Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ADeX is indeed a data exchange platform designed to streamline farmer services (statement 1 is correct). It contains crucial data points such as farmer identity and geotagged farm locations (statement 2 is correct). While ADeX can indirectly support crop insurance, its primary function is not focused exclusively on this (statement 3 is incorrect).  It does not primarily deal with livestock management (statement 4 is incorrect).  Consequently, only statements 1 and 2 accurately portray ADeX's purpose and functionalities.  The other options include erroneous claims about ADeX's scope and objectives.  UPSC often tests knowledge of digital initiatives in agriculture and their potential impact on farmer welfare.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  It involves the use of drones.
2.  It integrates remote sensing data.
3.  It focuses primarily on improving irrigation infrastructure.
4.  It is built on the foundational pillar of Agri Stack.

How many of the above statements accurately describe features of the Digital Agriculture Mission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Agriculture Mission utilizes drones for various tasks, including locust control (statement 1 is correct).  It incorporates remote sensing data for real-time information on crop conditions, etc. (statement 2 is correct).  However, the mission's scope is broader than just irrigation infrastructure; it aims to improve various aspects of agriculture (statement 3 is incorrect). The mission is fundamentally built on the Agri Stack (statement 4 is correct). Therefore, three of the statements accurately reflect aspects of the Digital Agriculture Mission. The other options underestimate the number of correct statements.  The UPSC often assesses candidates' understanding of technology's role in modernizing agriculture in India.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  It aims to prevent distress selling by farmers.
2.  It covers 22 crops, including both kharif and rabi crops.
3.  It is determined solely by market forces.
4.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is a key procuring agency.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism in India?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MSP mechanism is indeed intended to protect farmers from distress sales by guaranteeing a minimum price (statement 1 is correct). It encompasses a wide range of crops, including both kharif and rabi seasons (statement 2 is correct).  However, MSP is not solely determined by market forces; it involves government intervention and price setting (statement 3 is incorrect). The FCI plays a significant role in procuring crops at MSP (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the MSP system. The other options include misleading information about price determination and agency involvement.  A clear understanding of MSP and its implications for agricultural markets is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  It includes measures of gender inequality.
2.  It was first introduced in 2023.
3.  It is published by the World Bank.
4.  It replaces the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The B-Ready Index does not directly include measures of gender inequality; its focus is on the business and investment climate (statement 1 is incorrect).  It was launched in 2024, not 2023 (statement 2 is incorrect). It is published by the World Bank (statement 3 is correct).  And it indeed replaces the EoDB rankings (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the index's features and timeline.  UPSC often examines candidates' awareness of global indices and their relevance to economic policy.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  It offers small-value loans to marginalized individuals.
2.  It is primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  It typically charges higher interest rates than commercial banks.
4.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is a related initiative.

How many of the above statements accurately describe microfinance in India?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Microfinance does provide small-value loans to those lacking access to formal banking (statement 1 is correct).  It is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI (statement 2 is incorrect).  Microfinance institutions often charge higher interest rates compared to commercial banks (statement 3 is correct). PMMY is a government scheme related to microfinance (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe microfinance. Option (a) incorrectly includes the SEBI claim, while (b) and (c) only partially capture the correct aspects. The UPSC tests knowledge of financial inclusion policies and their implementation.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a congenital disease affecting skeletal muscles.
2.  It is caused by infections.
3.  It is a common condition.
4.  It can lead to muscle weakness.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Nemaline Myopathy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nemaline myopathy is indeed a congenital (present from birth) disease impacting skeletal muscles (statement 1 is correct).  It is caused by genetic mutations, not infections (statement 2 is incorrect).  It is a rare disease, not common (statement 3 is incorrect).  It does lead to muscle weakness (statement 4 is correct).  Only two statements accurately describe the condition. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the disease’s etiology and prevalence.  While seemingly a medical topic, questions on rare diseases and their impact can appear in UPSC's General Studies papers.


**1. Consider the following statements related to global poverty:**

1.  The World Bank's report, "Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet," highlights a recent stagnation in global poverty reduction.
2.  India had the largest number of people living in extreme poverty in a recent year.
3.  The "Prosperity Gap" refers to the income multiplier needed to bring everyone globally to a certain daily income standard.
4. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) considers deprivations in education, health, and living standards.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of global and Indian poverty according to the provided data?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly reflect information provided in the text.  Statement 1 accurately describes the World Bank's finding of stalled global poverty reduction due to a "polycrisis." Statement 2 correctly notes India's position as having the largest number of people in extreme poverty. Statement 3 correctly defines the "Prosperity Gap" as described in the text.  Finally, Statement 4 accurately reflects the components of the MPI as a multidimensional poverty measure considering education, health, and living standards.  Therefore, all four statements are factually correct based on the given information.


**2. Consider the following regarding India's National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI):**

1.  The NMPI was introduced in 2021 by the NITI Aayog.
2. The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) for its calculations.
3.  The NMPI includes indicators related to maternal health and bank accounts, in addition to the original global MPI indicators.
4. The NMPI value is calculated solely based on the headcount ratio.


How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the NMPI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The NMPI was indeed introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, utilizes NFHS data, and expands upon the global MPI by including maternal health and bank account indicators. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The NMPI value is calculated by multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), not solely based on the headcount ratio.  The intensity of poverty reflects the average number of deprivations experienced by the multidimensionally poor. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following features of India's e-commerce market:**

1.  The e-commerce sector's value in 2022 was approximately 7% of India's total retail market.
2.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model to encourage competition.
3.  The "Open Network for Digital Commerce" aims to create a closed, proprietary e-commerce network.
4.  A draft e-commerce policy seeks to create a supportive regulatory environment for the sector.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India's e-commerce landscape?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The text states that the e-commerce sector contributed around 7% to India's retail market in 2022 and that a draft policy aims to facilitate growth. Statement 2 is incorrect; FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based model to protect the unorganized retail sector.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Open Network for Digital Commerce is designed to be an *open-source* network, not a closed one. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following concerning household savings in India:**

1.  Household savings are categorized into financial savings (like deposits and insurance) and physical savings (like gold).
2.  A decline in financial savings poses challenges for the banking sector's liquidity and credit risk management.
3.  The household savings rate is calculated as the ratio of household savings to the fiscal deficit.
4.  India's household sector typically invests more than it saves, requiring borrowing from other sectors.

How many of the above statements regarding household savings in India are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Household savings are categorized as stated, and a decline in financial savings does impact banking sector liquidity and credit risk. Statement 3 is incorrect; the household savings rate is the ratio of household savings to GDP, not the fiscal deficit. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the text indicates that the household sector typically generates *surplus* savings, lending the excess to other sectors, not the reverse.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following elements related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India:**

1.  The GST Council has formed a group to address the taxation of luxury, sin, and demerit goods after the compensation cess ends.
2.  The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was created to compensate states for revenue losses due to GST implementation.
3.  Compensation cess is levied at a uniform rate across all luxury, sin, and demerit goods.
4.  Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) are typically classified as demerit goods under the GST framework.


How many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of India's GST system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  The GST Council is addressing the taxation of specific goods, and the Compensation Act aimed to mitigate revenue loss for states. Statement 3 is incorrect; the compensation cess is levied at *varied* rates, not a uniform rate, on luxury, sin, and demerit goods. Statement 4 is also incorrect; SUVs are typically classified as *luxury* goods, not demerit goods, under the GST framework. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following about India's efforts to reduce multidimensional poverty:**

1.  The poverty headcount ratio in India has decreased significantly between 2013-14 and 2022-23.
2.  Poorer states in India have experienced slower declines in poverty than wealthier states, indicating persistent regional disparities.
3.  India is projected to meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 1.2 well before 2030.
4. The NITI Aayog published a discussion paper analyzing multidimensional poverty in India since 2005-06.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect trends and initiatives related to poverty reduction in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The poverty headcount ratio has decreased, India is on track to meet SDG Target 1.2 ahead of schedule, and the NITI Aayog did publish the relevant discussion paper. Statement 2 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that *poorer* states recorded *faster* decline in poverty, indicating a reduction in disparities, not the opposite. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following concerning the "middle-income trap":**

1.  The World Bank's World Development Report 2024 discusses the risk of several countries, including India, falling into the middle-income trap.
2.  The middle-income trap refers to a situation where economies stagnate at middle-income levels and fail to transition to high-income status.
3.  The World Bank classifies countries with per capita GNI below US$1,135 as middle-income countries (MICs).
4.  India's per capita GDP is significantly higher than US$13,846.


How many of the statements above accurately describe the concept of the "middle-income trap" and India's context within it?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**3. Consider the following statements regarding Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  They provide small-value collateral-free loans primarily to low-income households.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulatory body for MFIs.
3.  Interest rates charged by MFIs are generally lower than those of commercial banks.
4.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) offers loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, partially overlapping with MFI services.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics and regulatory environment of MFIs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MFIs indeed cater to low-income individuals with small, collateral-free loans.  The RBI plays a crucial role in regulating these institutions to ensure responsible lending practices.  However, the statement that MFIs charge lower interest rates than commercial banks is incorrect; they typically charge higher rates to compensate for higher risk.  The PMMY complements MFI services by offering similar loan products through various channels.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate, while statement 3 is false. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the actual situation by underestimating or overestimating the number of correct statements.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016:**

1.  It aims to streamline the resolution process for distressed businesses.
2.  Insolvency Professionals (IPs) manage insolvency and liquidation processes, regulated by Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs).
3.  The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is the adjudicating authority for Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRPs).
4.  The Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) is exclusively for large corporate entities.

How many of the above statements correctly describe key aspects of the IBC, 2016?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IBC aims to provide a time-bound and efficient resolution mechanism for financially distressed businesses. IPs are central to this process, overseen by IPAs.  The NCLT plays a critical role in adjudicating CIRPs.  However, the statement regarding PPIRP is incorrect; it's designed for stressed corporate MSMEs, not exclusively large entities.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the IBC.  Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to correctly account for the number of accurate statements, particularly regarding the scope of PPIRP.


**5. Consider the following features related to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1.  They acquire Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions.

4.  ARCs aim to resolve acquired assets within a maximum of 8 years.


How many of the above features correctly describe the role and regulatory environment of ARCs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

ARCs play a crucial role in acquiring NPAs from banks, helping them clean up their balance sheets.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, indeed provides the legal framework for their operation.  ARCs typically have a time limit for resolving the acquired assets.  However, the statement about SEBI regulation is incorrect; ARCs are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately represent the characteristics of ARCs; therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly characterize the regulatory body or misrepresent the number of accurate statements.

4.  The introduction of a new tax on dairy products to fund research and development.

How many of the above initiatives are directly associated with improving the health, productivity, or management of the Indian dairy sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ‘Gau Chip’ and ‘Mahish Chip’ initiatives aim to improve livestock management through identification and tracking. The NADCP focuses on disease control, directly impacting animal health and productivity.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to improve the genetic stock and productivity of indigenous breeds.  However, the introduction of a new tax on dairy products is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are directly related to improving aspects of the dairy sector. Option (c) correctly identifies these three initiatives. Options (a), (b), and (d) either underestimate the number of relevant initiatives or incorrectly include an irrelevant one.


**7. Consider the following indicators used in the Human Development Report (HDR):**

How many of the above are indices used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to measure aspects of human development?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The HDI, GII, and IHDI are all indices developed and used by the UNDP to measure different aspects of human development. The HDI provides an overall measure, the GII focuses on gender inequalities, and the IHDI adjusts the HDI to account for inequality.  However, the MPI, while measuring poverty, is a separate initiative jointly undertaken by the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not solely a UNDP index. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are UNDP indices. Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the number of UNDP indices included in the list.


**8. Consider the following measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to manage liquidity in the banking system:**

1.  Open Market Operations (OMO) involving the buying and selling of government securities.
2.  Adjustments to the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR).
3.  Changes to the Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, and Bank Rate.
4.  Implementation of the Variable Rate Repo (VRR) and Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) mechanisms.

How many of the above are tools used by the RBI to influence liquidity in the Indian banking system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI employs all four mentioned measures to manage liquidity. OMOs directly impact the money supply, CRR and SLR adjustments affect banks' lending capacity, and changes to policy rates influence borrowing costs.  VRR and VRRR are additional tools for fine-tuning liquidity based on market conditions.  Therefore, all four options are correct.  Any option selecting less than four would be incorrect, as all the listed measures are tools used by the RBI for liquidity management.

**Explanation:**

KISAN directly utilizes space technology and geoinformatics for crop insurance and yield estimation.  ADeX, while not directly using satellite imagery, relies on geotagged farm location data, which often originates from satellite-based mapping systems.  The ICCC utilizes technologies like remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for informed decision-making. PM KUSUM Component-A, focused on solar power for farmers, doesn't directly involve space technology or remote sensing in its core functionality. Therefore, three out of the four initiatives (KISAN, ADeX, and ICCC) leverage space technology or remote sensing in their operation.


**2. Consider the following aspects of Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1.  MSP is announced at the beginning of the sowing season.
2.  The Food Corporation of India is the nodal procuring agency for all 22 MSP-covered crops.
3.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, but the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
4.  MSP covers only Kharif and Rabi crops, excluding commercial crops.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of India's MSP system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: MSP announcement timing aligns with the sowing season to benefit farmers. Statement 3 is also correct:  The CACP's recommendation is crucial, but the final authority lies with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. Statement 4 is incorrect: MSP also covers commercial crops like jute and copra, in addition to Kharif and Rabi crops.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; FCI is primarily for wheat and paddy. Thus, only three statements (1, 3, and a modified version of 2 focusing on wheat and paddy) accurately describe the MSP system.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural export performance and policies:**

1. India's agricultural exports exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion by 2022 set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.
2. Rice is the largest contributor to India's agricultural exports.
3. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) aims to improve export logistics and infrastructure.
4. The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme focuses on a product-specific approach to export promotion.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the current state of India's agricultural exports and related policies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: Agricultural exports fell short of the $60 billion target. Statement 2 is partially correct: Rice is a significant contributor but not necessarily the largest; marine products also hold a substantial share. Statement 3 is correct: TIES directly supports infrastructure development for exports. Statement 4 is correct: MAI emphasizes a focused approach to expand market access for specific products.  Therefore, only two statements (3 and 4) accurately reflect the situation.


**4. Consider the following elements related to Asset Monetization in India:**

1.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years.
2.  The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs.
3.  Asset Monetization primarily involves selling government-owned assets.
4.  The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended Asset Monetization in 2012.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Asset Monetization in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The NMP's timeframe is four years, not five. Statement 2 is incorrect: VGF provides up to 40%, not 50%, of project costs. Statement 3 is incorrect: Asset Monetization involves licensing or leasing, not necessarily outright sales. Statement 4 is correct: The Kelkar Committee's recommendation marked a significant milestone.  Only statement 4 is entirely accurate; therefore, only one statement is correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's livestock sector:**

1.  Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a major cause of economic losses in the livestock sector.
2.  India ranks first globally in the use of antibiotics in animals.
3.  The "Gau Chip" is a unified genomic chip developed for buffaloes.
4.  The average annual productivity of cattle in India surpasses the world average.

How many of the above statements accurately describe challenges and initiatives in India's livestock sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: FMD significantly impacts the sector. Statement 2 is incorrect: India ranks fourth, not first, in antibiotic use. Statement 3 is incorrect: "Gau Chip" is for cattle, not buffaloes ("Mahish Chip" is for buffaloes). Statement 4 is incorrect: Indian cattle productivity is lower than the world average. Only statement 1 is accurate.


**6. Consider the following concerning Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India:**

1.  A loan is classified as an NPA if it is overdue for more than 180 days.
2.  The Financial Stability Report is published annually by the RBI.
3.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, empowers secured creditors to take possession of collateral in case of loan defaults.
4.  The National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited focuses on resolving stressed assets below ₹500 crore.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of NPAs and related measures in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect:  A loan becomes an NPA after 90 days, not 180. Statement 2 is incorrect: The FSR is published biannually, not annually. Statement 3 is correct: SARFAESI provides this power to secured creditors. Statement 4 is incorrect: The NARCL handles stressed assets *above* ₹500 crore.  Therefore, only two statements (3, and a corrected version of 4) are accurate.


**7. Consider the following about the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA):**

1.  APEDA was established under the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority Act, 1995.
2.  APEDA promotes exports and handles GI registration for Indian products abroad.
3.  APEDA serves as the secretariat to the National Accreditation Board for organic exports.
4.  APEDA directly manages the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the roles and functions of APEDA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: APEDA was established in 1985, not 1995. Statements 2 and 3 are correct: APEDA performs these functions. Statement 4 is incorrect:  While APEDA supports export promotion, it doesn't directly manage the MAI scheme; that's handled by a separate government body. Therefore, three statements (2, 3, and a corrected version of 4) are correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS):**

1. PACS primarily lend to non-members for their mutual benefit.
2.  A PACS must have at least one hundred members to be operational.
3.  PACS are cooperative societies.
4.  PACS must maintain a minimum net owned fund of five lakh rupees.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of PACS in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: PACS lend only to their members. Statement 2 is incorrect: The minimum membership is two hundred, not one hundred. Statement 3 is correct: PACS are a type of cooperative. Statement 4 is incorrect: The minimum net owned funds are ten lakh rupees, not five.  Only statement 3 is correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS):**

1.  BIS is responsible for issuing the "Eco Mark" for environment-friendly products.
2.  BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2006.
3.  The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.
4.  BIS oversees the Hallmark certification for precious metals.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the functions and regulations of BIS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: BIS issues the Eco Mark. Statement 2 is incorrect: The BIS Act was enacted in 2016, not 2006. Statement 3 is incorrect: The ISI mark is mandatory only for *specific* products, not all. Statement 4 is correct: BIS oversees Hallmark certification. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) are accurate.


**10. Consider the following initiatives related to India's microfinance sector:**

1.  The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank was India's second Microfinance Institution (MFI).
2.  Microfinance loans are defined as collateral-free loans to households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh.
4.  The RBI's Malegam Committee's recommendations focused on regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) involved in microfinance.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's microfinance landscape?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: SEWA Bank was the *first*, not the second, MFI in India. Statement 2 is incorrect: The income limit for microfinance loans is *up to*, not exceeding, ₹3,00,000. Statement 3 is partially correct: the budget of 2024 increased the limit to ₹20 Lakh. Statement 4 is correct: The Malegam Committee addressed NBFC-MFI regulation. Therefore, only statement 4 (and a modified version of statement 3) is fully accurate.



1. Consider the following statements regarding the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP):

1. It was introduced in the IBC, 2016 through an amendment in 2020.
2. It is available for defaults of at least ₹ 5 lakh.
3. PPIRP is a purely formal process from initiation to completion.
4. PPIRP must be completed within 90 days.

Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PPIRP was introduced in the IBC, 2016, through an amendment in 2021, not 2020.  The amendment significantly altered the insolvency resolution process for MSMEs, providing a more streamlined and efficient mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PPIRP is available for defaults of at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹5 lakh. This threshold ensures that the process is targeted towards businesses with a certain level of debt, avoiding the unnecessary application of the process to smaller defaults.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PPIRP is a hybrid process, combining informal pre-initiation phases with formal post-initiation stages. This hybrid approach is designed to balance efficiency with legal safeguards.  The informal phase allows for quicker negotiations and settlements, while the formal phase ensures transparency and adherence to due process.

Statement 4 is incorrect. PPIRP is required to be completed within 120 days, not 90 days.  This timeframe is crucial for ensuring timely resolution of stressed assets.  The 120-day limit is designed to balance speed with due diligence and fair treatment of all parties.


2. Consider the following regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):

1. ARCs are financial institutions that primarily purchase Performing Assets from banks.
2.  The Narasimham Committee I proposed the establishment of ARCs.
3. ARCs are mandated to resolve assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.
4. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, envisioned that ARCs would be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs purchase Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), not Performing Assets, from banks and financial institutions.  The primary objective is to help banks clean up their balance sheets and improve their financial health by removing bad loans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Narasimham Committee II (1998), not Committee I, proposed the establishment of ARCs in India.  This recommendation was based on the success of similar asset management companies globally.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, of acquisition. This extended timeframe allows for a comprehensive and effective resolution strategy.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, envisioned that ARCs would be registered and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The RBI's oversight is crucial for maintaining financial stability and protecting the interests of depositors.


3. Consider the following entities regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):

1. All Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) regardless of size.
2. All Housing Finance Companies.
3. All Payment System Participants.
4. All Credit Information Companies (CICs).

How many of the above are correctly identified as entities regulated by the RBI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Not all NBFCs are regulated in the same way. While many are under RBI's purview,  the level of regulation differs based on size, activity, and perceived riskiness (as seen in the Scale-based Regulation for NBFCs).  Only NBFCs with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above, and those authorized to accept deposits or have customer interface are specifically mentioned in the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) operate within the financial sector,  the text does not explicitly state that *all* HFCs are under RBI's direct regulation in the same way as the other mentioned entities.  Their regulation might have some overlaps but is not fully encompassed in the given information.

Statement 3 is correct. All Payment System Participants are regulated by the RBI. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of the payment system.

Statement 4 is correct.  All Credit Information Companies (CICs) are regulated by the RBI to ensure the accuracy and reliability of credit information. This is critical for responsible lending and credit risk management.


4.  Consider the following statements related to the RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks:

1. The norms apply only to Urban Co-operative Banks.
2. Provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) are not required to be charged as an expense.
3. Co-operative banks may allocate net profits to BDDR only after complying with IRACP norms.
4. Provisioning, in this context, refers to banks setting aside funds from their capital to cover probable losses.


Which of the statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised norms apply to Urban, State, and Central co-operative banks, not just Urban Co-operative Banks.  This broader application ensures consistent regulatory standards across different types of co-operative banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Provisions for BDDR under IRACP norms *must* be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account. This is a crucial aspect of sound financial management and accurate financial reporting.

Statement 3 is correct. Co-operative banks are allowed to allocate net profits to BDDR only after complying with IRACP norms and other relevant regulations. This ensures that provisions are made for potential losses before profits are distributed.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Provisioning means that the bank sets aside a prescribed amount from *profits*, not capital, to cover probable losses. This distinction is important because it reflects the prudent allocation of earnings to mitigate potential risks.


5. Consider the following regarding the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):

1. It is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2. It operates as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for the Urban Cooperative Bank (UCB) sector.
3. The need for a UO for India’s UCB sector was first highlighted by the Das Committee.
4. One of its major functions is to provide direct lending to UCBs.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I. Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which accurately reflects NUCFDC's role in providing services to UCBs.

Statement 2 is correct. NUCFDC operates as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for the UCB sector, providing support and guidance on regulatory compliance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The need for a UO for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by the Viswanathan Committee, not the Das Committee.  The Das Committee subsequently built upon this recommendation, providing a more detailed model.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While NUCFDC aims to provide liquidity and capital support, it does not directly lend to UCBs. Its functions involve raising capital, offering fund management services, and providing consultancy, all to support the financial health and stability of UCBs.


6. Consider the following statements about the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):

1. The PCA framework is effective from April 1, 2024.
2. It applies to all UCBs, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
3. Exit from PCA requires no breaches in risk thresholds for two consecutive quarterly financial statements.
4. Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are key monitoring areas.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework is effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024. This date marks the transition from the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, *except* those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  This exception reflects a differentiated approach to supervision based on the level of risk.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Exit from PCA and the withdrawal of restrictions require no breaches in risk thresholds for four successive quarterly financial statements, not two. This stringent requirement ensures the sustained financial health of the UCB.

Statement 4 is correct. Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are indeed the key areas for monitoring under the PCA framework.  These parameters provide a comprehensive assessment of the UCB's financial health and stability.


7. Consider the following related to Microfinance in India:

1.  The RBI is the regulatory body for all MFIs operating in the country.
2.  Microfinance loans are defined as collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
3. The Malegam Committee recommended a framework to regulate NBFC-MFIs.
4. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loans are exclusively provided through MFIs.


Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the RBI plays a significant role, the regulation of MFIs might involve other bodies depending on their specific characteristics.  The statement is not entirely inaccurate in the context of the provided information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Microfinance loans are defined as collateral-free loans to individuals/groups belonging to low-income households, having an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  This income ceiling is crucial for targeting the intended beneficiaries of microfinance schemes.

Statement 3 is correct. The Malegam Committee (2010) played a vital role in recommending a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs in India, addressing concerns about the sector's growth and potential risks.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loans are provided through various channels, including commercial banks, NBFCs, and others, not exclusively through MFIs.  This broader approach ensures wider access to credit for small and micro enterprises.


8. Consider the following regarding the Jute Corporation of India (JCI):

1. The JCI was established in 1972 as a price support agency for jute.
2. The JCI implements the Jute I-CARE Project, which focuses on improving jute farming techniques.
3. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging for all commodities.
4. JCI's primary function is to regulate jute production and pricing.

Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JCI was established in 1971, not 1972, as a price support agency for jute. This early establishment demonstrates the government's commitment to supporting the jute industry.

Statement 2 is correct. The JCI implements the Jute I-CARE Project, which aims at mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting using microbial consortium, thus improving cultivation and processing techniques.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging material for *specific* commodities, not all commodities. This targeted approach balances the promotion of jute with the practicality of using other packaging materials where appropriate.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the JCI influences jute pricing through its price support role, its primary function is not to regulate production and pricing directly.  It acts as a price support agency, intervening to stabilize prices and ensure fair returns to farmers.


9. Consider the following about the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS):

1. NAFIS was launched in 2017-18.
2. NAFIS provides insights into rural livelihoods and the level of financial inclusion.
3.  NAFINEX is a measure of financial inclusion based on data from NAFIS.
4. NAFIS primarily focuses on the financial health of rural banks.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS was launched in 2016-17, not 2017-18. The launch date marks the beginning of a comprehensive effort to understand the financial inclusion landscape in rural India.

Statement 2 is correct. NAFIS provides a comprehensive overview of rural population in terms of their status of livelihoods and level of financial inclusion, including access to loans, insurance, and pensions.

Statement 3 is correct. NAFINDEX is a measure of financial inclusion developed using data collected through NAFIS.  This index provides a quantitative assessment of financial inclusion progress.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  NAFIS covers a broader scope than just the financial health of rural banks. It provides a holistic view of financial inclusion in rural areas, encompassing various financial services and their accessibility to the rural population.


10. Consider the following about the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT):

1. The CBDT is responsible for the administration of indirect tax laws.
2. The CBDT functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
3. The CBDT administers direct tax laws through the Income Tax Department.
4. The CBDT is responsible for the formulation of monetary policy.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 3
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBDT is responsible for the administration of *direct*, not indirect, tax laws. Indirect taxes are administered by a different body, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).

Statement 2 is correct. The CBDT functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance. This organizational placement highlights the CBDT's role in the government's overall fiscal management.

Statement 3 is correct. The CBDT administers direct tax laws through the Income Tax Department. This reflects the CBDT's role in overseeing the collection and enforcement of direct taxes.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The formulation of monetary policy is the responsibility of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the CBDT.  The RBI's mandate is to maintain price stability and manage the country's currency.



1. Consider the following statements regarding GST:

1. GST is a direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services.
2. The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act introduced GST in 2017.
3. The GST Council is a statutory body established under Article 279B of the Constitution.
4.  The GST Appellate Tribunal is the first appellate authority for disputes related to GST.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016, paved the way for the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, which came into effect in 2017.  Statement 1 is incorrect; GST is an *indirect* tax, not a direct tax. Direct taxes are levied on the income or profits of individuals or corporations, while indirect taxes are levied on goods and services.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the GST Council is established under Article 279A, not Article 279B.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the GST Appellate Tribunal is a *second* appellate authority.  First appeals are typically heard by the designated appellate authorities under the CGST and SGST Acts. Therefore, only two statements are correct.



2. Consider the following features of the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS):

1. Import duties on finished goods are higher than on input goods.
2.  IDS makes domestic products cheaper and enhances export competitiveness.
3. Taxpayers facing IDS have Input Tax Credit (ITC) blocked in their GST electronic credit ledger.
4.  IDS simplifies working capital management for taxpayers.

How many of the above features accurately describe IDS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An inverted duty structure exists when the import duty (or, in the context of GST, the tax rate) on input goods is *higher* than on finished goods. Statement 3 is correct.  The higher tax on inputs compared to outputs means businesses have excess input tax credit (ITC) that cannot be fully utilized, leading to blocked working capital. Statement 4 is incorrect.  IDS creates working capital issues, precisely because ITC is blocked, tying up funds.  Statement 2 is incorrect; IDS makes domestic products *more* expensive and *hinders* export competitiveness due to the higher cost of inputs. Therefore, only one statement accurately describes IDS.


3. Consider the following regarding the amendment to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions on immovable properties:

1. The amendment reinstates indexation benefits for all properties.
2. The amendment abolishes indexation benefits for properties acquired after July 23, 2024.
3. The amendment introduces a grandfather clause for properties acquired before July 23, 2024.
4. The amendment applies retrospectively to all properties acquired before 2024.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the amendment?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The amendment continues the abolishment of indexation benefits announced in Budget 2024-25 for properties acquired *after* the specified date. Statement 3 is correct: A grandfather clause protects properties acquired *before* July 23, 2024, allowing them to continue benefiting from indexation. Statement 1 is incorrect: Indexation benefits are *not* reinstated for all properties; they are only retained for those acquired before the cutoff date. Statement 4 is incorrect: The amendment is not retrospective; it applies prospectively to properties acquired after July 23, 2024.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


4. Consider the following statements about the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):

1. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2. NaBFID is a private financial institution with majority government ownership.
3. NaBFID's primary objective is to promote short-term infrastructure financing.
4. NaBFID is notified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 4 is correct. The central government notified NaBFID as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013.  Statement 1 is incorrect; NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. Statement 2 is incorrect; NaBFID is a public financial institution, with its entire shareholding currently held by the Government of India. Statement 3 is incorrect; NaBFID focuses on *long-term* non-recourse infrastructure financing.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


5. Consider the following regarding India's e-commerce sector:

1.  In 2022, the sector was worth $100 billion.
2. 100% FDI is permitted under the automatic route for inventory-based e-commerce models.
3. The Draft e-Commerce Policy aims to hinder the growth of the e-commerce sector.
4.  The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a platform-centric model.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states the sector was worth $70 billion in 2022, not $100 billion. Statement 2 is incorrect. 100% FDI is *not* permitted under the automatic route for inventory-based e-commerce models in India; it is permitted for marketplace models.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Draft e-Commerce Policy aims to *facilitate* and create a supportive regulatory environment for the growth of the e-commerce sector. Statement 4 is incorrect. ONDC uses a network-centric model, not a platform-centric model, aiming for greater inclusivity and interoperability. Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


6.  Consider the following about the Equalisation Levy:

1. It was initially applied at a rate of 10% on online advertisements.
2. In 2020, its scope was extended to cover e-commerce supplies from non-resident operators to Indian residents.
3.  The levy is applicable only to non-resident e-commerce operators *without* a permanent establishment in India.
4. The purpose of the levy is to promote fair competition and provide governments with the ability to tax businesses effectively.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Equalisation Levy?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The scope of the Equalisation Levy was expanded in 2020 to include e-commerce supplies to Indian residents by non-resident operators. Statement 4 is correct:  The levy aims to ensure fair competition and give governments the power to tax businesses operating within their jurisdiction. Statement 1 is incorrect: The initial rate was 6%, not 10%.  Statement 3 is incorrect: The 2% levy is applicable to non-resident e-commerce operators *with* a permanent establishment in India.

A core element of the AoA's Market Access pillar is tariffication, the process of replacing non-tariff barriers (like quotas and variable levies) with equivalent tariffs. The AoA also addresses domestic support measures (subsidies) that impact production and trade, classifying them into different categories (boxes) based on their trade-distorting effects.  Finally, the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 established a commitment for both developed and developing countries to eliminate export subsidies, aiming for a fairer global agricultural trading environment.  The statements accurately reflect these crucial elements of the AoA.


**2. Consider the following regarding mechanisms to address double taxation in international trade:**

1.  A Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism primarily used to resolve existing transfer pricing disputes under tax treaties.
2.  Advanced Pricing Agreements (APAs) are designed to prevent future transfer pricing disputes for specific transactions.
3.  Both MAP and APAs are mechanisms exclusively applied to active income, preventing double taxation of profits from business operations.
4.  Taxpayers utilize MAP for pending disputes while choosing APAs as a proactive strategy for similar future transactions.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the differences and applications of MAP and APAs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  MAP is indeed a mechanism within tax treaties (like DTAs) used to resolve *existing* transfer pricing disputes between tax authorities of two countries. APAs, conversely, aim to *prevent* future disputes by establishing pre-agreed transfer pricing methods for specific transactions between related parties in different jurisdictions.  Taxpayers typically use MAP for resolving already arisen disputes, whereas they opt for APAs for future transactions to avoid potential conflicts. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  MAP and APAs are not limited to active income; they can also be applied to resolve double taxation issues related to passive income (e.g., interest, royalties, dividends).  Both mechanisms are crucial for ensuring fair and consistent taxation in international transactions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The UN's Ad Hoc Committee is indeed working on a framework convention for international tax cooperation, and the ultimate goal is to establish a more equitable and effective global tax system. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that developed nations such as the US, UK, and Australia *opposed* the treaty's terms of reference. While the treaty aims to enhance international tax cooperation, statement 4 is misleading. While the OECD's Global Minimum Tax is a related initiative aiming to curb profit shifting by MNCs, the UN Global Tax Treaty has a broader scope than just a minimum tax rate.  It intends to address various aspects of international taxation to create a fairer system.

India's EEZ is vast and holds significant potential for offshore mineral resources.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The rules explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals listed in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  While statement 4 mentions commercially viable deposits, the text only states the *presence* of gold, diamonds, and rare earth elements, not their commercial viability.  Further exploration and assessment are required to determine the economic feasibility of extracting these minerals.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural exports:**

1. Agricultural exports and imports experienced a decline in 2023-24.
2. Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products.
3. India's share of the global agricultural export market in 2022 was over 5%.
4. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) provides assistance for upgrading cold chains and border haats.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the state of India's agricultural exports and related support schemes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The provided text indicates a decline in both agricultural exports and imports in 2023-24.  TIES does indeed offer support for infrastructure development, including cold chains and border haats. However, statement 2 is inaccurate. While rice is a significant export, the text indicates that it constitutes 21% of total exports, with marine products holding a 15% share.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  India's share of the global agricultural export market in 2022 was 2.4%, not over 5%, according to the cited WTO data.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate representations of the facts.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY):**

1. PMMSY is an umbrella scheme aiming to improve fish production and productivity.
2. The scheme promotes the adoption of advanced technologies like Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) and Biofloc.
3. PMMSY focuses solely on marine fisheries, neglecting inland fisheries infrastructure development.
4. The Rangeen Machhli app, developed under PMMSY, provides information on ornamental fish species.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the objectives and components of PMMSY?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. PMMSY is a comprehensive scheme designed to enhance fish production and productivity through various interventions.  It actively encourages the use of modern technologies such as RAS and Biofloc for sustainable aquaculture.  The Rangeen Machhli app is indeed a part of PMMSY, offering information on ornamental fish.  However, statement 3 is inaccurate.  PMMSY addresses both marine and inland fisheries, aiming to improve infrastructure and production across the sector.  Therefore, three of the four statements correctly describe PMMSY's scope and initiatives.


**7. Consider the following about Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1. MSP is the minimum price at which the government procures crops from farmers to prevent distress selling.
2.  MSP currently covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops.
3. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, with the final decision resting with the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
4.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the MSP mechanism in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. MSP serves as a safety net for farmers, ensuring a minimum price for their produce.  The number of crops covered under MSP is accurately stated as 22.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate.  While FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the *sole* agency for all MSP-covered crops. Other agencies also participate in procurement depending on the crop and region.  Hence, only two statements are fully accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements related to the World Trade Organization (WTO):**

1. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, established the WTO, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2. The WTO's scope encompasses trade in services and intellectual property rights, beyond just goods.
3. The WTO's dispute settlement mechanism is designed to resolve trade disputes between member countries.
4.  All WTO member countries have equal voting rights in the organization's decision-making processes.

How many of the statements above correctly describe the WTO and its functions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement did indeed lead to the formation of the WTO, expanding the scope of trade regulations beyond just goods to include services and intellectual property. The WTO provides a mechanism for resolving trade disputes between member countries.  However, statement 4 is inaccurate.  The WTO's decision-making process involves weighted voting, with larger economies typically having more influence than smaller ones.  Therefore, only three of the statements correctly depict the WTO's structure and functions.


**9. Consider the following about the Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security:**

1. PSH allows governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) and distribute them to the poor.
2. The "de minimis" limits under the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture define permissible levels of domestic support for PSH.
3. Developed countries generally support higher de minimis limits for developing countries' PSH programs.
4. India seeks a permanent solution at the WTO to address concerns regarding its PSH program.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the aspects of Public Stockholding (PSH) policies and the global debate surrounding them?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. PSH programs enable governments to buy crops at MSPs and distribute them to vulnerable populations.  The WTO's AoA sets de minimis limits on domestic support, impacting PSH programs.  India actively seeks a permanent solution at the WTO to address concerns about its PSH program and allow for higher levels of food subsidies.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Developed countries generally *oppose* higher de minimis limits for developing countries' PSH programs, arguing that they distort markets.  They view such programs as unfair competition.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the complexities of PSH policies and the international discussions around them.

**12. Consider the following about the Marrakesh Agreement:**

1. It was signed in 1994.
2.  It led to the formation of the WTO.
3.  It primarily focused on trade in agricultural products.
4.  It replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement was signed in 1994, marking the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations.  This agreement led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as the primary global trade governance body.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Marrakesh Agreement addressed agricultural trade, its scope extended beyond it to encompass trade in services, intellectual property rights, and other areas.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**13. Consider the following regarding the WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13):**

1. It was held in Abu Dhabi.
2.  It fully resolved the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue.
3.  PSH policies allow governments to procure crops at MSP.
4.  Developed countries generally support increasing de minimis limits for PSH.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The WTO's MC13 was held in Abu Dhabi. PSH (Public Stockholding) policies enable governments to purchase crops from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), playing a role in food security and farmer support.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MC13 did not fully resolve the PSH issue; it concluded without a permanent solution.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Developed countries generally oppose increasing de minimis limits for PSH, viewing it as a market-distorting subsidy.  Developing countries advocate for such increases. Therefore, only two statements are correct.

1. It is an initiative of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.
2.  It aims to create decentralized storage facilities at PACS level.
3.  PACS can avail subsidies for constructing warehouses.
4.  The plan focuses solely on modernizing existing FCI facilities.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The plan aims to establish decentralized grain storage facilities at the level of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS), enhancing storage capacity closer to farmers.  PACS can indeed access subsidies and interest subvention for constructing godowns and other agricultural infrastructure.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  It's an initiative of the Ministry of Cooperation, not the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the plan aims to improve overall storage capacity, it doesn't focus solely on modernizing existing Food Corporation of India (FCI) facilities. It also includes creating new storage facilities at the PACS level. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**15. Consider the following regarding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1.  Capital adequacy is a key monitoring area for UCBs.
2.  Profitability is not a factor in determining PCA for UCBs.
3.  PCA is imposed if risk thresholds are breached.
4.  Exit from PCA requires consistent improvement over eight quarters.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Capital, asset quality, and profitability are all key areas monitored for UCBs' financial health.  If a UCB breaches the established risk thresholds, it can be placed under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA).

Statement 2 is incorrect. Profitability is a critical factor considered when determining whether to place a UCB under PCA.  Poor profitability indicates financial distress.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Exit from PCA requires consistent improvement over four successive quarters, not eight. Therefore, three statements are correct.


**16. Consider the following about Microfinance in India:**

1.  SEWA Bank was established in 1976.
2.  All collateral-free loans to low-income households are considered microfinance loans.
3.  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) typically charge lower interest rates than commercial banks.
4.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. As per RBI guidelines, collateral-free loans to low-income households (with an annual income up to ₹3,00,000) are classified as microfinance loans.

Statement 4 is partially correct, but outdated. While the PMMY initially provided loans up to ₹10 lakh, the 2024 Union Budget increased the limit to ₹20 lakh for those who have successfully repaid previous loans under the Tarun category.


Statement 1 is incorrect. SEWA Bank was established in 1974, not 1976.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MFIs generally charge higher interest rates compared to commercial banks due to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income borrowers. Therefore, only two statements (2 and the updated version of 4) are substantially correct.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's infrastructure development initiatives:**

1. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharatmala Pariyojana indeed aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases, significantly expanding India's national highway network.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project, under the aegis of DFCCIL (Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited), is a crucial component of the National Rail Plan 2030. Its primary objective is to enhance the efficiency and capacity of freight transportation by rail, thereby increasing its share in the overall freight traffic from the existing level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While LEEP and PM GatiShakti aim to improve logistics efficiency, their scope is broader than just road transport.  They encompass various modes of transport and aim for integrated logistics solutions, incorporating railways, waterways, and other infrastructure components.  PM GatiShakti, in particular, emphasizes a holistic approach to infrastructure development, integrating various ministries and departments.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The investment outlay for the MMLPs initiative is stated to be $6.2 billion, not exceeding $5 billion.  This is a significant investment aimed at modernizing and streamlining logistics operations across multiple modes of transport.

Therefore, only two of the statements (1 and 2) accurately reflect the facts related to India's infrastructure development plans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RELOS agreement with Russia (and other countries) is designed to facilitate broader logistical support, including fuel, rations, spare parts, and berthing for troops, warships, and aircraft during both wartime and peacetime operations.  It is not limited to fuel replenishment for warships alone.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ULIP aims to create a unified digital platform for seamless logistics across various modes of transport, not just road-based logistics. It is meant to integrate the various aspects of logistics into a single, easily accessible platform.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The LEADS index assesses the ease of doing business in the logistics sector *across different states* within India, highlighting state-level variations in logistics performance and policy effectiveness, not national-level policies.

Therefore, only one statement (1) accurately describes aspects of India's port sector and logistics infrastructure.



**3. Consider the following statements about initiatives aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity and farmer welfare:**

1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) exclusively focuses on improving crop yield estimation through satellite imagery.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India Stack includes three interconnected layers: identity, payment, and data governance.  It's not limited to just identity and payment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The One Future Alliance aims to *support* and *accelerate* the implementation of DPI in low- and middle-income countries, providing capacity building, technical assistance, and funding. It's not about hindering implementation.

Statement 3 is correct. The GDPIR is indeed intended to establish a focused institution for the global advancement of DPI.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The EU-India TTC agreement on DPI aims for broader international collaboration on DPI development and deployment, not solely within the EU.

Therefore, only one statement (3) accurately describes aspects of India's DPI and related global initiatives.  The other options contain misleading or factually incorrect information, testing the examinee's detailed knowledge.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning India's financial sector:**

1. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) will be implemented from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs and is categorized as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
3.  Ease of expansion for some UCBs includes the permission to open new branches up to 10% (maximum 5 branches) of the existing number of branches in the previous financial year without prior RBI approval.
4.  The RBI's intervention in managing UCBs includes aspects of management, governance, and winding up, but excludes the handling of their capital adequacy.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulatory environment for India's urban cooperative banks?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date of the PCA framework for UCBs is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. NUCFDC does operate as an SRO for UCBs, but it's classified as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II implies it accepts public funds or has a customer interface, while Type I does not.

Statement 3 is correct.  The ease-of-expansion policy for UCBs allows them to open a limited number of new branches without prior RBI approval.

Statement 4 is incorrect. RBI's oversight of UCBs encompasses management, governance, winding up, and *also* capital adequacy.  Capital adequacy is a crucial aspect of their financial health and stability.

Therefore, only two statements (3 and, with a correction, 2) accurately reflect aspects of the regulatory environment for India's urban cooperative banks.  The inaccuracies in the other statements test the examinee's precise knowledge of the regulatory details.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India:**

(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; ARCs do purchase NPAs from banks.  Statement 4 is also correct; the Narasimham Committee II recommended ARCs. However, statement 1 is incorrect; PPIRP has a minimum default threshold (₹10 lakh). Statement 3 is incorrect; ARCs are regulated by the RBI, not SEBI.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements related to the Indian Microfinance sector:**

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Buying G-secs injects liquidity into the market. Statement 2 is incorrect. Reducing CRR and Repo Rate *increases* market liquidity. Statement 3 is incorrect. VRR is generally *lower* than the Repo Rate, but above the Reverse Repo Rate. Statement 4 is correct. Selling G-secs through OMO absorbs excess liquidity. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly reflect the relationship between RBI actions and market liquidity.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI revised PSL guidelines to *promote* small loans in economically disadvantaged districts, not discourage them. Statement 2 is correct. PSL aims to direct credit towards sectors vital for inclusive growth. Statement 3 is incorrect. The revised guidelines aim to *reduce* average loan sizes in such districts, to make credit more accessible. Statement 4 is correct.  PSL indeed targets these sectors and others considered crucial for socio-economic development. Thus, only statements 2 and 4 are correct, leading to (b) as the correct answer. The remaining options misinterpret the intent and effects of the revised PSL guidelines.

4.  A high CD ratio can increase liquidity risk for banks.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a high CD ratio might suggest lending activity, it doesn't automatically mean strong performance; it can also indicate higher risk. Statement 2 is correct. A high CD ratio signifies a larger portion of bank funds are channeled into loans. Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI expresses concern over excessively high CD ratios, as they can lead to risks. Statement 4 is correct.  High CD ratios can indeed expose banks to liquidity risks if borrowers default or if deposit growth lags behind loan growth.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct, resulting in (b) as the correct option. The other options incorrectly assess the implications of a high CD ratio on bank performance and stability.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Bharatmala Pariyojana indeed targets the construction of roughly 65,000 km of national highways, significantly bolstering road infrastructure. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project is also correctly described; it aims to substantially increase the share of rail freight in India's overall freight transport, aligning with the National Rail Plan 2030's objectives.  Statement 4 is partially correct, ULIP aims to integrate different logistics systems and improve efficiency but doesn't specifically focus on customs clearance.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  LEEP aims to improve overall freight transport efficiency, encompassing various modes, not solely road transport. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the described initiatives.  The inclusion of seemingly plausible but slightly inaccurate details (like focusing only on road transport efficiency in LEEP) serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of these programs.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts within the logistics sector.


2. Consider the following initiatives related to India's infrastructure development:

1.  The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) allows Indian and Russian militaries to access each other's bases and ports for logistical support.

3.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a digital master planning tool developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).
4.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. RELOS facilitates reciprocal access to logistics and support facilities between India and Russia for military purposes. Statement 2 is also correct; Vadhvan Port is planned to be India's largest container port and a major deep-water port. Statement 3 is incorrect. The digital master planning tool for PM GatiShakti is developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics), not the NIC. Statement 4 is correct. The NMP aims to generate investment through the monetization of government assets, with the stated target.  The inclusion of the incorrect entity in statement 3 acts as a key distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the implementing agency. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify the correct details about various infrastructure projects.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate. KISAN leverages space technology for improved yield estimation, and ADeX holds the specified datasets. Statement 3 is inaccurate. While MSP covers many Kharif and Rabi crops, the total number of crops covered is 22, not 25.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate. The target of $60 billion in agricultural exports was indeed set by the 2018 policy, but the target year was 2022, not 2024. Therefore, only two statements are completely correct. The incorrect statements present plausible but false details to increase the difficulty and test the candidate's precise knowledge of the agricultural sector.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern subtle inaccuracies in seemingly correct statements.


4. Consider the following statements concerning India's economic policies:

1.  The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as a global leader in technical textiles.
2.  The RoDTEP scheme replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) to refund taxes and levies on exported products.
3.  The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) comprises eight core industries, representing 50% of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
4.  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is responsible for formulating India's FDI policy.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The National Technical Textiles Mission indeed aims for global leadership, RoDTEP replaced MEIS as stated, and DPIIT is responsible for FDI policy formulation.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The eight core industries in the ICI represent 40.27% of the IIP's weight, not 50%. The slightly inaccurate percentage in statement 3 serves as a distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the economic indicators. The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify the correct figures related to key economic policies and indicators.


5. Consider the following about India's financial and services sectors:

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement established the WTO, developing countries seek the stated amendments regarding PSH, and the Trade Connect e-Platform aims to assist MSMEs in international trade. Statement 2 is incorrect. MC13 did *not* result in a permanent solution to the PSH issue; it concluded without such a resolution. The incorrect outcome of MC13 regarding PSH serves as a key distractor, demanding precise knowledge of the WTO's recent activities. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of India's trade policies within the context of WTO negotiations and agreements.  The question also tests the candidate's knowledge of the outcome of the 13th Ministerial Conference of WTO.

1.  National Food Security Mission (NFSM)
2.  Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)
3.  Crop Diversification Programme (CDP)
4.  Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)

How many of the above initiatives are directly involved in promoting pulse cultivation in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NFSM directly aims to increase pulse production through area expansion and productivity enhancement. PM-AASHA includes pulses under its price support scheme at Minimum Support Price (MSP), thus directly supporting pulse cultivation. The CDP, a sub-scheme of RKVY, focuses on crop diversification in specific states, which can include pulses as a part of the diversification strategy.  Therefore, three initiatives (NFSM, PM-AASHA, and CDP) are directly involved in promoting pulse cultivation. RKVY is a broader scheme and not exclusively focused on pulses.  Option (a) is incorrect as more than one scheme is directly involved. Option (b) is incorrect because three schemes are directly related. Option (d) is incorrect because RKVY is not exclusively focused on pulses, even though CDP under it might indirectly support pulse cultivation.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the MSP system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is the minimum price at which the *government* purchases crops from farmers, not private buyers. This crucial distinction safeguards farmers from distress selling at lower market prices.  The government acts as a buyer of last resort, ensuring a baseline price for their produce.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MSP system in India covers a wider range of crops than just Kharif crops. It encompasses 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra), along with additional MSPs for Toria and de-husked coconut based on the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard and copra, respectively. This broad coverage reflects the government's commitment to supporting diverse agricultural production.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. This process ensures that political and economic considerations are integrated into the MSP determination, reflecting the broader national interest.

Consequently, none of the provided statements accurately depict the MSP system.  The statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding the buying entity, crop coverage, and decision-making authority, demonstrating the need for precise understanding of this critical agricultural policy mechanism.



3. Consider the following regarding India's Agricultural Export Policy:

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Agricultural exports in India did *not* consistently increase annually after the policy's inception.  In fact, there was an 8% decline in 2023-24, indicating the policy's challenges in achieving consistent growth despite its stated aims. This highlights the complexities of international markets and the need for adaptive strategies in agricultural export promotion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was *not* achieved.  The shortfall underscores the gap between policy aspirations and on-the-ground realities, highlighting the need for a reassessment of the policy's strategies and targets.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) is not solely focused on domestic agricultural infrastructure.  It aims to improve infrastructure with *export linkages*, such as border haats, land custom stations, cold chains, and trade promotion centers. This export-oriented focus is essential for facilitating efficient and competitive agricultural exports.


Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the policy's performance or components.  The statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding export growth, target achievement, and the scope of TIES, demonstrating the need for a thorough understanding of the policy's impact and mechanisms.

1. The ISI mark is solely managed by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
2.  The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.
3. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and managing the ISI mark.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the ISI mark and its governance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays a significant role in promoting standards and quality control, the ISI mark is not solely managed by this ministry. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the primary body responsible for its development and implementation, operating under the overall framework of government policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ISI mark is *not* mandatory for all products sold in India.  The Central Government mandates it for *specific* products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), based on considerations of safety, quality, and public interest.  This selective approach ensures that the mandatory application of the ISI mark is targeted and effective.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), established under the BIS Act, 2016, is responsible for developing and managing the ISI mark.  It sets the standards, oversees testing and certification, and ensures that products bearing the mark meet the specified quality and safety requirements.  This role is central to the ISI mark's credibility and effectiveness.

Therefore, only one statement accurately describes the ISI mark and its governance.  The incorrect statements highlight potential misconceptions about the scope of the ISI mark's mandatory application and the specific agency responsible for its management.



5. Consider the following features of  Household Savings in India:

1. Household savings are categorized solely into financial savings.
2. A decline in financial savings benefits the banking sector's liquidity and credit risk management.
3. The household sector typically invests all its savings internally, without lending to other sectors.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of household savings in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Household savings in India are categorized into *both* financial savings (currency, deposits, life insurance funds, etc.) and physical savings (physical assets, gold, and silver).  This dual categorization reflects the diverse forms in which households accumulate savings, reflecting both liquid and illiquid assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A decline in financial savings poses *challenges* for the banking sector in maintaining liquidity and managing credit risk.  Financial savings are a crucial source of funds for banks, and their reduction can constrain lending capacity and increase credit risk.  This highlights the interconnectedness of household savings and the stability of the financial system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. In India, the household sector typically generates *surplus* savings relative to its investments, lending the excess to other sectors of the economy.  This surplus plays a vital role in financing investment and economic growth, contributing to national capital formation.


Therefore, only one statement is incorrect.  The incorrect statements reveal a misunderstanding of the diverse composition of household savings, their impact on banking sector stability, and the role of household savings in broader economic activity.



6. Consider the following regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India:

1.  Excise duty under GST applies to all goods and services.
2. State Excise duty is levied on petroleum products by the Central Government.
3. The GST Compensation Cess was designed to compensate states for revenue losses due to GST implementation.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the GST system in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Excise duty under the GST regime does *not* apply to all goods and services.  It primarily applies to petroleum products and alcohol.  Many other forms of excise duty that previously existed were subsumed under the GST, simplifying the tax structure but leaving specific items under the purview of excise duty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. State Excise duty is levied on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances, not petroleum products. Petroleum products remain subject to central excise duty, reflecting the continuing distinction in tax administration at the central and state levels.

Statement 3 is correct. The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was enacted precisely to levy a Compensation Cess on certain goods, compensating states for revenue losses that might arise from the implementation of the GST. This mechanism aimed to ensure fiscal stability during the transition to the new tax regime.


Therefore, only one statement is correct.  The incorrect statements demonstrate a lack of clarity on the scope of excise duty under GST and the specific products subject to State Excise duty, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the GST's structure and its implications for different tax categories.



7. Consider the following statements concerning India's tax treaties and international tax cooperation:

1. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS aims to curb tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).
2.  The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS was signed by India in 2023.
3. Pillar One of the BEPS Two-pillar approach focuses on reallocating profits of MNEs to countries where their production takes place.

How many of the above statements accurately describe India's involvement in international tax cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is a global initiative explicitly designed to combat tax avoidance strategies employed by multinational enterprises (MNEs).  India's participation in this framework underscores its commitment to ensuring fair tax practices globally.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS in 2017, not 2023.  This date reflects the timeline of India's engagement in this crucial international tax agreement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Pillar One of the BEPS Two-pillar approach focuses on reallocating profits of MNEs to countries where their *consumers* are present, not where their production takes place.  This consumer-centric approach addresses the challenges of taxing large digital companies that may have minimal physical presence in the jurisdictions where they generate significant revenue.


Therefore, only one statement is correct. The incorrect statements reveal inaccuracies regarding the timing of India's convention signing and the specific focus of Pillar One in the BEPS framework, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of this complex area of international tax cooperation.



8. Consider the following features of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:

1.  All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating methodologies and conflict of interest guidelines.
3.  The RBI solely regulates all aspects of CRAs' operations in India.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulatory landscape of CRAs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While several CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions, not *all* of them are.  Brickwork Ratings, for example, is a notable exception. This highlights the nuanced regulatory overlap between SEBI and RBI in overseeing CRAs' operations.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, clearly mandate that CRAs must disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines on dealing with conflict of interest. This transparency requirement is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of credit ratings.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI does not solely regulate all aspects of CRAs' operations. SEBI also plays a significant regulatory role, particularly concerning the disclosure and transparency requirements of CRAs.  This shared regulatory responsibility reflects the importance of maintaining both financial stability and investor protection in the credit rating sector.

Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the regulatory landscape of CRAs. The incorrect statements highlight misconceptions about the extent of RBI accreditation among SEBI-registered CRAs and the exclusive nature of RBI's regulatory authority.  This underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the multi-agency regulatory framework governing CRAs in India.


9. Consider the following statements regarding Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India:

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs are *not* exclusively used for investing in residential real estate.  They primarily focus on infrastructure projects such as toll roads, power lines, and pipelines.  This distinction is crucial in understanding their role in financing large-scale infrastructure development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) *does* regulate InvITs, setting the framework for their establishment, operations, and investor protection.  This regulatory oversight is essential for ensuring transparency and investor confidence in this investment vehicle.

Statement 3 is correct. InvITs offer a mechanism for investors to participate in infrastructure projects through relatively low ticket sizes.  This accessibility makes infrastructure investment more inclusive, broadening the participation beyond large institutional investors.


Therefore, only one statement accurately describes InvITs.  The incorrect statements reflect misconceptions about the types of projects InvITs finance and the regulatory oversight they are subject to.  This emphasizes the need for a clear understanding of this important investment vehicle's characteristics and regulatory environment.


10. Consider the following about Jute cultivation and related initiatives in India:

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) explicitly aims to increase pulse production through area expansion and productivity enhancement.  PM-AASHA, while relevant to pulses through its price support scheme, focuses more broadly on oilseeds and pulses. The Crop Diversification Programme is geared towards diversifying crops in specific regions, not solely focused on pulses.  The Yellow Revolution targeted edible oil production, primarily from mustard and sesame seeds, not pulses. Therefore, only the NFSM directly targets increased pulse production.  The other options include initiatives with broader or different agricultural focuses, creating plausible but incorrect distractors.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's jute industry:**

1. India accounts for approximately 70% of global jute goods production.
2. The National Jute Board (NJB) was established under the National Jute Board Act, 2008.
3.  The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987 mandates the use of jute packaging.
4.  Assam is the largest jute-producing state in India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. India holds a significant share of global jute production, the NJB's establishment date is correct, and the compulsory use of jute packaging is mandated by the mentioned Act. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while Assam is a jute-producing state, West Bengal holds the largest share of jute production in India.  The inclusion of statement 4 as a plausible but false statement increases the difficulty of the question, requiring precise knowledge of the jute industry's geographical distribution.


**3. Consider the following schemes related to the development of India's oilseed sector:**

1. National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP)
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)
4. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)

How many of the above schemes are directly involved in promoting oilseed production or supporting oilseed farmers?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NFSM-OS&OP and NMEO-OP directly focus on oilseed and oil palm cultivation. PM-AASHA provides price support to oilseed farmers.  MIDH, however, focuses on horticulture, fruits, vegetables, and other crops, not directly on oilseeds. Therefore, only three of the listed schemes are directly involved in the oilseed sector. The inclusion of MIDH as a distractor highlights the need for careful consideration of the specific goals of each scheme.


**4. Consider the following factors contributing to stagnant millet production in India:**

1. Labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer application.
2. Consumer preference shifts towards fine cereals.
3. Relatively shorter shelf life of millets compared to other grains.
4. Lack of government support for millet cultivation.

How many of the above factors contribute to the stagnation of millet production?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Labor shortages, insufficient fertilizer, and the shorter shelf life of millets are all factors contributing to stagnant production. While government support is crucial, the question focuses on factors directly impacting production.  The absence of explicit government support for millet cultivation in the text doesn't necessarily negate the impact of the other three factors. The inclusion of "lack of government support" as a potential but ultimately less direct factor increases the difficulty and requires a nuanced understanding of the issue.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning India's agricultural exports:**

1. Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports.
2. India's share of the global agricultural export market is over 5%.
3. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) aims to improve agricultural export infrastructure.
4. APEDA promotes exports and handles GI registration for Indian agricultural products abroad.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 and 4 are correct.  TIES indeed aims to improve export infrastructure, and APEDA's role in export promotion and GI registration is accurate. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while rice is a significant export, marine products hold a larger share. Statement 2 is also incorrect; India's share of the global agricultural export market is below 5%. The inclusion of these seemingly plausible but incorrect statements tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the data on Indian agricultural exports.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1. The MSP covers 22 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs.
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.
4. MSP is aimed at preventing distress selling by farmers.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The MSP covers a range of crops, the CACP's role in recommending MSPs is accurate, and the aim of MSP is to prevent distress selling.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while FCI is the major procuring agency for wheat and paddy, it's not the nodal agency for all MSP-covered crops. The inclusion of a seemingly correct but ultimately false statement about FCI's role tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the MSP mechanism.


**7. Consider the following initiatives related to India's fisheries sector:**

1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF)
3. Rangeen Machhli app
4. National Horticulture Mission (NHM)

How many of the above initiatives are specifically designed to promote or support the fisheries sector in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PMMSY and FIDF are directly related to the development of the fisheries sector. The Rangeen Machhli app also supports the ornamental fish segment within the fisheries sector.  However, the National Horticulture Mission (NHM) focuses on horticulture, not fisheries.  Therefore, only three initiatives are directly related to the fisheries sector.  The inclusion of NHM as a distractor tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between related but distinct agricultural development programs.


**8. Consider the following technologies or platforms used in India's agricultural sector:**

1. FASAL Project (Forecasting Agricultural Output)
2. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology)
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)
4. National Fisheries Development Program Portal

How many of the above are primarily focused on leveraging technology for improved agricultural management or information dissemination?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

FASAL, KISAN, and ADeX all utilize technology for improved agricultural management and data analysis. The National Fisheries Development Program Portal also leverages technology for information dissemination within the fisheries sector.  Therefore, all four options represent technological advancements in the agricultural sector.  There are no incorrect options here, testing the candidate's comprehensive understanding of various tech-enabled initiatives.


**9. Consider the following statements about India's silk production:**

1. India is the world's largest silk producer.
2. Karnataka is the leading silk-producing state in India.
3. India produces all four major varieties of silk (Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga).
4. The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its platinum jubilee.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Karnataka is a major silk producer, India produces all four silk varieties, and the Central Silk Board's platinum jubilee is mentioned.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; India is the second largest silk producer, not the largest. The inclusion of a seemingly correct but incorrect statement about India's global ranking in silk production tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the industry.


**10. Consider the following regarding seaweed farming in India:**

1. Seaweed farming is considered a part of aquaculture.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims for significant seaweed production by 2025.
3. Seaweed cultivation is primarily land-based in India.
4.  Seaweed farming plays a role in carbon sequestration.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Seaweed farming is part of aquaculture, the PMMSY targets seaweed production, and seaweed farming contributes to carbon sequestration.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; seaweed cultivation is also undertaken offshore, particularly in the Andaman region. The inclusion of this geographically specific detail increases the difficulty and tests specific knowledge about seaweed farming practices.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economic concepts and incorporating challenging distractors.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms for Cooperative Banks:**

1.  The norms mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account.
2.  Cooperative banks can allocate net profits to BDDR only after complying with IRACP norms and other regulations.
3.  The new norms apply only to Central Cooperative Banks, excluding Urban and State Cooperative Banks.
4.  Provisioning, in this context, refers to the bank setting aside a prescribed amount from its liabilities to cover probable losses.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The revised norms clearly state that provisions for BDDR must be an expense and that net profit allocation to BDDR is contingent upon compliance with other regulations. Statement 3 is incorrect; the norms apply to Urban, State, and Central Cooperative Banks. Statement 4 is also incorrect; provisioning involves setting aside funds from *profits*, not liabilities, to cover potential losses.  This distinction is crucial in understanding the financial health and risk management practices of banks.


**2. Consider the following features of Co-lending arrangements as per RBI guidelines:**

1.  Multiple lenders share the risk and increase lending capacity.
2.  Banks can co-lend with any NBFC, regardless of its promoter group affiliation.
3.  A minimum of 20% credit risk must be borne by the NBFC, with the remaining risk borne by the bank.
4.  Co-lending is restricted to loans for non-priority sectors only.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the RBI's co-lending framework?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe the RBI's co-lending framework.  Co-lending aims to share risk and increase lending capacity, and a risk-sharing model with a minimum 20% for the NBFC is in place.  Statement 2 is incorrect; banks are prohibited from co-lending with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. Statement 4 is also incorrect; co-lending is permitted for priority sectors.  Understanding the nuances of co-lending is vital for analyzing the financial landscape and risk mitigation strategies employed by banks and NBFCs.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Wilful Defaulters (WD) as per RBI directions:**

1.  A wilful defaulter is a borrower who deliberately avoids repaying loans, regardless of their repayment capacity.
2.  The minimum outstanding amount for WD classification is ₹1 crore.
3.  Consequences for WDs include credit bans and potential criminal charges.
4.  The RBI's directions on WDs are based solely on the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005.

Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct representations of RBI's stance on wilful defaulters.  The definition emphasizes deliberate avoidance of repayment, and the consequences include severe penalties.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the minimum outstanding amount is ₹25 lakh, not ₹1 crore. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the RBI's directions are based on the RBI Act, 1934, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005.  Understanding the definition and implications of wilful default is important for assessing credit risk and the regulatory framework governing lending institutions.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) as announced by the RBI:**

1.  The FI-Index measures financial inclusion across various sectors, including banking, investments, and insurance.
2.  It is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete exclusion.
3.  The index incorporates three parameters: Access, Usage, and Quality, with Usage accounting for the largest weightage.
4.  The FI-Index is published quarterly, in January, April, July, and October.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the RBI's FI-Index?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The FI-Index covers multiple sectors,  allocates the highest weightage to Usage, and is published annually (not quarterly). Statement 2 is incorrect; 100 represents full inclusion, not complete exclusion.  A thorough understanding of the FI-Index is important for assessing the progress of financial inclusion initiatives and their impact on various segments of the population.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021:**

1.  It was launched as part of the RBI's Alternate Grievance Redressal framework.
2.  It covers all commercial banks, but excludes Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative Banks.
3.  It aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints.
4.  Its formation is based solely on the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.

Which of the above statements are true regarding the RB-IOS?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the objectives and framework of the RB-IOS. It aims to provide a cost-effective mechanism for resolving customer grievances, and it functions under the broader RBI grievance redressal framework. Statement 2 is incorrect; it does cover RRBs and certain cooperative banks (those meeting specific criteria). Statement 4 is also incorrect; its formation is based on the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  Understanding the RB-IOS is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of grievance redressal mechanisms in the banking sector.



**6. Consider the following statements concerning the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1.  It is registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  It primarily functions as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for UCBs.
3.  Its establishment was recommended by the N.S. Viswanathan committee in 2009.
4.  One of its key functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs, with a target capital of ₹500 crore.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the NUCFDC?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 (b) 1, 2, and 4 (c) 1 and 2 only (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe the NUCFDC. It is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, functions as an SRO, and aims to provide capital support with a target of ₹300 crore (not ₹500 crore). Statement 3 is incorrect; the model was recommended by the V.S. Das committee (following the N.S. Viswanathan committee's initial highlighting of the need).  Understanding the NUCFDC's role is important for analyzing the regulatory and developmental initiatives aimed at strengthening the urban cooperative banking sector.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1.  It replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  It applies to all UCBs, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
3.  Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are key monitoring areas.
4.  Exit from PCA requires no breaches in risk thresholds for two consecutive quarters.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the new PCA framework for UCBs?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The PCA framework replaces SAF, focuses on capital, asset quality, and profitability, and requires four consecutive quarters without breaches for exit.  Statement 2 is incorrect; it excludes UCBs under AID.  Understanding the PCA framework is essential for assessing the RBI's approach to regulating and supervising the financial health of UCBs.


**8.  Consider the following regarding the RBI's concerns about banks' high Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio:**

1.  A high CD Ratio indicates that a significant portion of a bank's resources are allocated to loans.
2.  A high CD Ratio always leads to lower Net Interest Margins (NIMs).
3.  The RBI's Financial Stability Report indicates that the CD Ratio peaked in December 2023 at 78.8%.
4.  Slower deposit growth, partially driven by customer shifts to investments, contributes to a high CD Ratio.

Which of the above statements correctly reflect the RBI's concerns about high CD Ratios?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 (b) 1, 3, and 4 (c) 2, 3, and 4 (d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the RBI's concerns. A high CD ratio does indicate a significant portion of resources allocated to loans, it did peak at 78.8% in December 2023, and slower deposit growth is a contributing factor. Statement 2 is incorrect; while a high CD ratio *can* put pressure on NIMs, it doesn't always lead to lower NIMs.  The relationship is complex and depends on various other factors, including interest rate spreads and operating costs. Understanding the implications of a high CD ratio is important for assessing the stability and profitability of banks.


**9. Consider the following about the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs):**

1. NBFCs are allowed to accept demand deposits like banks.
2.  NBFCs are part of the payment and settlement system.
3.  Deposit insurance from DICGC is available for NBFC depositors.
4.  Scale-based regulation (SBR) for NBFCs categorizes them into four layers based on size and risk.

Which of the above statements are incorrect regarding NBFC regulations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all incorrect. NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits, they are not part of the payment and settlement system, and their depositors are not covered by DICGC insurance.  Statement 4 is correct; SBR does categorize NBFCs into four layers based on size and risk.  Understanding the differences between banks and NBFCs and their respective regulatory frameworks is crucial for evaluating investment options and assessing financial risks.


**10. Consider the following regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1. ARCs are financial institutions that buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks.
2. ARCs are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, mandates that ARCs resolve assets within a maximum of 5 years.
4. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) proposed the establishment of ARCs in India.

How many of the above statements correctly describe ARCs?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. ARCs buy NPAs, the SARFAESI Act sets a maximum resolution period of 8 years (not 5 years), and the Narasimham Committee II did propose their establishment. Statement 2 is incorrect; ARCs are regulated by the RBI, not SEBI.  Understanding the role and regulation of ARCs is essential for assessing their impact on the resolution of stressed assets in the banking sector.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) oversight of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs):**

1.  All NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets exceeding ₹100 crore and engaging in deposit acceptance or customer interface are subject to RBI regulation.
2.  The RBI's oversight extends to all Payment System Participants.
3.  Credit Information Companies (CICs) are explicitly excluded from RBI's regulatory purview.
4.  The RBI may appoint Ombudsmen for a term exceeding five years to handle customer complaints.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that all NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above, and those accepting deposits or interacting with customers, fall under RBI's regulatory umbrella.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that all Payment System Participants are subject to RBI oversight.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text includes CICs among the entities under RBI's regulatory purview.  Therefore, this statement is factually inaccurate.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The text specifies that the tenure of the RBI Ombudsmen is a maximum of three years, not exceeding five years.  This contradicts the statement.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate, making (b) the correct option. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the RBI's regulatory scope concerning NBFCs, Payment System Participants, and CICs, as well as the tenure of the Ombudsmen.



**2. Consider the following features of the Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs) as finalized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  SROs must be established as for-profit companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  An SRO's eligibility criteria include having adequate net worth and sufficiently diversified shareholding.
3.  SROs are mandated to develop standards for improving compliance culture but not surveillance methods for sector monitoring.
4.  The governance framework necessitates that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, excluding the Chairperson, comprises independent members.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct regarding the RBI's Omnibus Framework for SROs?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The framework requires SROs to be set up as *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, not for-profit entities.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that adequate net worth and diversified shareholding are eligibility criteria.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The framework mandates SROs to develop standards for improving compliance culture *and* surveillance methods.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The requirement is that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, *including* the Chairperson, must be independent.

Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are NOT correct, making (b) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly identify the inaccurate statements within the RBI's Omnibus Framework for SROs.



**3. Consider the following aspects of the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  As a Type II NBFC-ND, NUCFDC accepts public funds and maintains a customer interface.
3.  NUCFDC functions solely as a regulatory body for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
4.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was initially highlighted by a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) working group chaired by Shri V.S. Das.

Which of the above statements regarding NUCFDC are NOT correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a *Type II* NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds, a key characteristic of NUCFDC.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text confirms NUCFDC's status as a Type II NBFC-ND, accepting public funds and having a customer interface.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While NUCFDC acts as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the UCB sector, its functions extend beyond mere regulation.  It also provides liquidity and capital support and technological assistance.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The need for a UCB umbrella organization was first highlighted by the RBI working group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan, not Shri V.S. Das.  The Das working group built upon this by providing a model.

Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are inaccurate, making (d) the correct option. Other options misrepresent the facts about NUCFDC's organizational structure, operational nature, and the history of its establishment.


**4. Consider the following features of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1.  The PCA framework aims to address the financial health of UCBs with reduced precision and inflexibility.
2.  The framework will be effective from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
3.  The framework applies to all UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, excluding those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
4.  Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are not the key areas for monitoring under the PCA framework.


Which of the above statements is/are NOT correct regarding the RBI's PCA framework for UCBs?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework explicitly aims to address UCB financial health with *greater* precision and flexibility, the opposite of what the statement claims.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The implementation date is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the framework applies to all UCBs in the specified tiers, except those under AID.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Capital, asset quality, and profitability are indeed the key monitoring areas under the PCA framework.

Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are NOT correct, making (c) the correct answer.  The other options fail to accurately identify all the incorrect statements about the RBI's PCA framework for UCBs.



**5. Consider the following regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India:**

1.  GST is a comprehensive indirect tax levied on the supply of goods but not services.
2.  The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279B of the Constitution.
3.  The GST Appellate Tribunal is a first appellate authority for hearing appeals against orders passed by the Appellate Authority under the CGST Act, 2017, and State GST Acts.
4.  Excise duty on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances is collected by the Central Government and is called "Central Excise" duty.


How many of the above statements are NOT correct regarding GST in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GST is levied on the supply of *both* goods and services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GST Council is established under Article 279A, not Article 279B.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a *second* appellate authority, not the first.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Excise duty on alcohol, etc., is collected by the *State* Government, not the Central Government, and is called "State Excise" duty.

Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 4) are incorrect, making (c) the correct answer. Option (a) and (b) incorrectly identify the number of inaccurate statements.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS):**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where import duties on finished goods are higher than on input goods.
2.  IDS affects domestic industries, making it easier for them to compete in the export market.
3.  Taxpayers facing IDS will always have Input Tax Credit (ITC) in their GST electronic credit ledger.
4.  IDS leads to working capital issues for taxpayers due to high input tax.


Which of the above statements are NOT correct regarding the Inverted Duty Structure?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 and 4
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDS is characterized by import duties on *input* goods being higher than on *finished* goods—the opposite of what the statement describes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IDS makes it *more difficult* for domestic industries to compete in the export market due to the higher cost of inputs.

Statement 3 is correct. Taxpayers facing IDS will have ITC blocked until the sale of the finished product.

Statement 4 is correct.  High input tax under IDS does lead to working capital issues as resources are tied up in ITC.

Thus, statements 1 and 2 are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer. Options (c) and (d) do not correctly identify all the incorrect statements, and option (b) includes an accurate statement.


**7. Consider the following concerning Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions on immovable properties:**

1.  The recent amendment to the Finance Bill, 2024, reinstates indexation benefits for properties acquired before July 23, 2024.
2.  The grandfather clause allows properties purchased before the cutoff date to continue benefiting from indexation despite new rules.
3.  The amendment abolishes indexation benefits for all properties acquired after July 23, 2024.
4.  The amendment introduces indexation benefits for properties acquired after July 23, 2024.


Which of the above statements are correct regarding the amendment to LTCG tax provisions?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendment *continues* the abolishment of indexation benefits, not reinstates them.

Statement 2 is correct. The grandfather clause does apply to properties acquired before the cutoff date.

Statement 3 is correct.  Indexation benefits are abolished for properties acquired after July 23, 2024.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The amendment does *not* introduce indexation benefits for properties acquired after the cutoff date.

Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct, making (b) the correct answer. Other options incorrectly represent the impact of the amendment on indexation benefits for long-term capital gains on immovable property.



**8. Consider the following regarding the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index):**

1.  The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete exclusion and 0 represents full inclusion.
2.  The FI-Index incorporates details from the banking, investment, and insurance sectors.
3.  The FI-Index is published bi-annually in January and July.
4.  Access, Usage, and Quality are the three broad parameters used in calculating the FI-Index.


Which of the above statements are NOT correct regarding the FI-Index?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In the FI-Index, 0 represents complete exclusion, and 100 represents full inclusion—the opposite of what is stated.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FI-Index includes banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published *annually* in July, not bi-annually.

Statement 4 is correct. Access, Usage, and Quality are the three parameters used.

Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.  Other options fail to accurately identify the inaccurate statements concerning the Financial Inclusion Index.



**9. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021:**

1.  RB-IOS was launched in 2022 as part of the Alternate Grievance Redress (AGR) Framework of RBI.
2.  The scheme's formation is based on the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.
3.  RB-IOS aims to provide a costly redress of customer complaints.
4.  The scheme covers all commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above.


Which of the above statements are NOT correct regarding RB-IOS?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 and 4
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022.

Statement 2 is correct. The scheme's formation is based on the mentioned Acts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. RB-IOS aims to provide *cost-free* redressal of customer complaints.

Statement 4 is correct. The scheme covers the mentioned banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above.

Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.  Other options fail to accurately identify all the incorrect statements regarding the RB-IOS.



**10. Consider the following regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1.  ARCs are financial institutions that buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions to clean up their balance sheets.
2.  ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.
3.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, provided for ARCs to be registered and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
4.  The Narasimham Committee II (1998) proposed the establishment of ARCs.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct regarding ARCs?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ARCs function as described.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, to resolve acquired assets.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ARCs are registered and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.

Statement 4 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II did propose ARCs.

Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.  Other options do not accurately identify all the incorrect statements concerning ARCs.


**11. Consider the following about Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:**

1.  There are six CRAs registered with SEBI.
2.  All six CRAs are RBI-accredited domestic CRAs.
3.  SEBI regulations require CRAs to disclose their rating criteria and methodology.
4.  RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA do not regulate any aspects of CRAs.


How many of the above statements are NOT correct regarding CRAs in India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. There are seven CRAs registered with SEBI, not six.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Only six of the seven CRAs are RBI-accredited; Brickwork Ratings is the exception.

Statement 3 is correct. SEBI regulations mandate this disclosure.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA do regulate certain aspects of CRAs.

Therefore, two statements (1 and 2) are incorrect, making (b) the correct answer.  Other options incorrectly identify the number of inaccurate statements.



**12. Consider the following regarding Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs):**

1.  InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds that allow investment in infrastructure projects.
2.  InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
3.  The new norms allow for the issuance of subordinate units by publicly placed InvITs to sponsors.
4.  InvITs earn income primarily through dividends from their investments.


Which of the above statements are NOT correct regarding InvITs?

(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 and 1
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. InvITs function as described.

Statement 2 is correct. Sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under SARFAESI.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The new norms allow issuance of subordinate units by *privately* placed InvITs, not publicly placed ones.

Statement 4 is correct. While InvITs earn income through multiple avenues, dividends are a significant source.

Therefore, only statement 3 is incorrect, making (a) the correct answer. Other options incorrectly identify the inaccurate statements.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India:

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies.
2.  Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Companies are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  Chit Fund Companies fall under the regulatory purview of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulates Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Companies, stock exchanges, stock brokers, and sub-brokers.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Chit Fund Companies are primarily regulated by the respective State Governments, not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, although the latter may have some oversight related to company registration and compliance.  Statement 1 is also incorrect. While the RBI regulates a significant portion of the NBFC sector, Housing Finance Companies are primarily regulated by the National Housing Bank (NHB), a subsidiary of the RBI.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the regulatory landscape of NBFCs in India, highlighting the complexities and nuances of financial sector regulation.


2. Consider the following features related to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):

1.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, irrespective of their tier categorization.
2.  The framework's objective is to enhance the precision and adaptability in addressing the financial health of UCBs.
3.  UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID) are excluded from the PCA framework's application.
4.  Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the key monitoring areas under the PCA framework.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the PCA framework for UCBs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The PCA framework aims for greater precision and flexibility in addressing UCB financial health; UCBs under AID are indeed exempt; and capital, asset quality, and profitability are the core monitoring parameters.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework specifically excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions and applies only to UCBs in Tier 2, 3, and 4 categories.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the nuances of the PCA framework. The inclusion of a partially correct statement (1) serves as a strong distractor, requiring careful analysis to identify the precise scope and application of the PCA framework.


3. Consider the following regarding the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  It functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
3.  One of its primary functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs.
4.  The need for an umbrella organization for UCBs was first identified by the V.S. Das working group.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the NUCFDC?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. NUCFDC acts as an SRO for UCBs, offering liquidity and capital support; and the need for such an umbrella organization was highlighted by the V.S. Das working group (following the initial identification by the N.S. Viswanathan working group).  Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, meaning it accepts public funds and has a customer interface, unlike Type I NBFCs.  This question tests factual knowledge about NUCFDC's structure, function, and historical context, emphasizing the importance of understanding the different types of NBFCs and the role of SROs in the financial sector. The inclusion of a slightly incorrect statement concerning NBFC type serves as a significant distractor.


4. Consider the following entities regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):

1.  All Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) with assets exceeding ₹100 crore.
2.  All Payment System Participants.
3.  Credit Information Companies (CICs)
4.  Housing Finance Companies.

Which of the above are directly regulated by the RBI?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Payment System Participants and CICs are directly under RBI's purview, and while the RBI has significant influence over the NBFC sector, Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) are primarily regulated by the National Housing Bank (NHB), a subsidiary of the RBI.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it excludes the exception of Housing Finance Companies.  The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the RBI’s regulatory reach and the specific regulatory bodies involved in overseeing different segments of the financial sector. The inclusion of Housing Finance Companies as a distractor tests the understanding of the division of regulatory responsibilities.


5. Consider the following aspects of the RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs):

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  An SRO should possess adequate net worth and a sufficiently diversified shareholding structure.
3.  An SRO's governance framework must include at least one-third independent directors on its board.
4.  An SRO is required to develop standards for improving compliance culture and surveillance methods.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the eligibility criteria or characteristics of SROs as per the RBI's framework?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  SROs require adequate net worth and diversified shareholding; at least one-third of board members must be independent; and they must develop compliance standards and surveillance methods. Statement 1 is incorrect. SROs, under the RBI's framework, must be *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the RBI's SRO framework, requiring precise recall of the eligibility criteria and characteristics of recognized SROs. The inclusion of a partially correct statement concerning the for-profit/not-for-profit nature of SROs acts as a key distractor.


6. Consider the following regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):

1.  ARCs are required to maintain a minimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) of ₹200 crore to commence business.
2.  ARCs must obtain a certificate of registration (CoR) from the SEBI before commencing business.
3.  The age limit for the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) or Whole-time Director of an ARC is 70 years.
4.  ARCs are mandated to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 15% of their total risk-weighted assets.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the regulatory requirements for ARCs in India?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  The age limit for MD/CEO or Whole-time Director is indeed 70; and ARCs must maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 15%. Statement 1 is incorrect; the minimum NOF is ₹300 crore, not ₹200 crore. Statement 2 is also incorrect; ARCs obtain their CoR from the RBI, not SEBI.  The question tests the detailed regulatory requirements for ARCs, focusing on numerical values and regulatory authorities.  The use of slightly incorrect numerical values and regulatory bodies serves as a key distractor, demanding precise knowledge.


7. Consider the following statements concerning the RBI's surplus and its transfer to the government:

1.  The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of the RBI's entire net interest income to the Central Government.
2.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, suggests transferring surplus based on realized equity and economic capital.
3.  The Currency and Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA) includes capital, reserves, and unrealized gains or losses.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions regarding the RBI's surplus transfer?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The ECF does indeed suggest surplus transfer based on realized equity and economic capital; and the CGRA does include capital, reserves, and unrealized gains/losses.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of *profits*, not the entire net interest income, to the Central Government.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the legal and policy frameworks governing the RBI's surplus transfer, highlighting the distinction between profits and net interest income. The inclusion of a partially correct statement increases the difficulty level and demands careful analysis.


8. Consider the following statements about the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) scheme:

1.  The WMA scheme is exclusively available to State Governments.
2.  Special WMA (now SDF) has a higher interest rate than Normal WMA.
3.  The interest rates for WMA are linked to the repo rate.
4.  WMA is a facility provided by the RBI to meet temporary mismatches in the cash flows of receipts and payments.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the WMA scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  Interest rates for WMA are indeed linked to the repo rate; and the purpose of WMA is to address temporary cash flow mismatches.  Statement 1 is incorrect, as the WMA facility is also available to the Union Government.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; Special WMA (now SDF) has a *lower* interest rate than Normal WMA.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the WMA scheme, including its beneficiaries and interest rate structure.  The use of slightly incorrect information regarding beneficiaries and interest rates increases the difficulty level, demanding precise knowledge.


9. Consider the following regarding Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:

1.  All collateral-free loans to individuals or groups belonging to high-income households are treated as microfinance loans.
2.  The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a framework to regulate NBFC-MFIs.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans exclusively to MFIs.
4.  The SHG-Bank Linkage Program was initiated by the RBI in 1992.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of microfinance in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Malegam Committee did indeed recommend a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs. Statement 1 is incorrect; microfinance loans target low-income households, not high-income ones. Statement 3 is also incorrect; PMMY provides loans through various channels, not exclusively to MFIs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the SHG-Bank Linkage Program was initiated by NABARD, not the RBI.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of microfinance regulations, schemes, and the key players involved.  The use of incorrect information regarding income levels, loan beneficiaries, and initiating agency increases the difficulty level, requiring precise understanding.


10. Consider the following regarding Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:

1.  All seven CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2.  SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy.
3.  The RBI is the sole regulatory authority for all aspects of CRAs’ operations.
4.  Brickwork Ratings is an RBI-accredited domestic CRA.

How many of the statements correctly describe the regulation and operation of CRAs in India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. SEBI regulations do require CRAs to disclose their methodologies and policies; and Brickwork Ratings is indeed an RBI-accredited domestic CRA. Statement 1 is incorrect; only six CRAs (excluding Brickwork) are RBI-accredited. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the RBI regulates certain aspects, SEBI is also a key regulator for CRAs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory framework for CRAs in India, highlighting the multiple regulatory bodies involved.  The inclusion of partially correct information concerning the number of RBI-accredited CRAs and the regulatory landscape enhances the difficulty level.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (covering diverse aspects of Indian economics and governance), some questions necessarily draw on multiple sections.  The difficulty is achieved through subtle misdirection in the options and requiring precise recall of information.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the GST Council:**

1. It is a statutory body established under Article 279A of the Constitution.
2. The Union Finance Minister chairs the council.
3. Decisions require a two-thirds majority of weighted votes, with states holding a majority.
4. It is responsible for setting tax rates and making policy recommendations on GST to the Centre and states.

How many of the above statements are accurate depictions of the GST Council's structure and function?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is a *constitutional* body, not a statutory one, established under Article 279A.  Statements 2 and 4 are accurate reflections of the GST Council's composition and responsibilities. Statement 3, however, contains a slight inaccuracy. While states do hold a greater voting weight (two-thirds), the phrasing "majority" is misleading.  A decision requires a three-fourths majority of the weighted votes, not a simple majority. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC):**

1. The IBC aims to resolve distressed businesses within 180 days, extendable to 330 days.
2. Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) handle corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs).
3. Information Utilities (IUs) authenticate and disseminate financial information to facilitate the insolvency resolution process.
4. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) hears appeals against NCLT decisions related to IBC cases.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the IBC?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the time frame for CIRP under the IBC.  Statement 2 is incorrect;  NCLTs, not DRTs, handle CIRPs for corporate entities. Statement 3 correctly describes the role of IUs.  Statement 4 accurately outlines the appellate process for NCLT decisions within the IBC framework. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following features of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):**

1.  It replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  It applies to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3.  Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are key monitoring areas.
4. It is implemented by the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC).

How many of these features accurately describe the RBI's PCA framework for UCBs?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the PCA framework's characteristics.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while the NUCFDC plays a role in supporting UCBs, it does not implement the PCA framework. The RBI itself implements the PCA framework. Therefore, only three of the statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following related to the  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):**

1.  It aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.
2.  It is managed by the Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs.
3.  It targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over a five-year period.
4.  It primarily focuses on the monetization of public sector banks.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the NMP?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the NMP's core objective.  Statement 2 is correct; the Private Investment Unit plays a key role in policy-level matters related to the NMP.  Statement 3 is largely correct, although it's a four-year (FY22-FY25), not five-year, target. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NMP encompasses a broader range of government assets than just public sector banks. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 (with the minor correction on the timeframe) are accurate.


**5. Consider the following concerning Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs):**

1.  DTAAs aim to avoid double taxation on the same declared asset in two countries.
2.  The agreement between India and Mauritius was first signed in 1981.
3.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) resolves double taxation disputes.
4.  DTAAs are primarily concerned with the avoidance of tax on immovable property.

How many of the above statements correctly describe key aspects of DTAAs?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the purpose of DTAAs. Statement 2 is incorrect; the India-Mauritius DTAA was first signed in 1982, not 1981. Statement 3 correctly describes the function of the MAP. Statement 4 is incorrect; DTAAs cover a wider range of taxes and assets than just immovable property.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**6. Consider the following regarding the Geographical Indications Act, 1999:**

1. It guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge.
2. It is primarily concerned with the protection of industrial designs.
3. It is administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
4. UNESCO recognition plays a role in its implementation.


Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the Geographical Indications Act, 1999?

(a) 1 and 4 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Act's purpose of protecting collective rights related to geographical indications.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act does not primarily deal with industrial designs. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act is an Indian law, not administered by the WTO.  Statement 4 is partially correct; while UNESCO recognition of intangible cultural heritage is relevant to the broader context of traditional knowledge, it's not directly involved in the Act's implementation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is fully correct, and statement 4 is partially true in a broader context.


**7. Consider the following aspects of the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS):**

1.  It refers to a situation where import duties on input goods are lower than on finished goods.
2.  It leads to Input Tax Credit (ITC) accumulation for taxpayers.
3.  It is primarily a concern in the context of indirect taxation.
4.  It benefits domestic industries by lowering production costs.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics of an Inverted Duty Structure?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; IDS is characterized by *higher* import duties on input goods than on finished goods.  Statement 2 is correct;  taxpayers facing IDS have accumulated ITC. Statement 3 is correct; IDS is a phenomenon within indirect tax systems like GST. Statement 4 is incorrect; IDS *harms* domestic industries by raising production costs. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**8. Consider these elements related to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) functions:**

1.  Managing monetary policy is a key function.
2.  It is responsible for the administration of direct tax laws.
3.  It regulates Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).
4. It is responsible for setting interest rates on government bonds.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of RBI functions?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; monetary policy management is a core RBI function. Statement 2 is incorrect; the administration of direct tax laws falls under the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), not the RBI. Statement 3 is correct; RBI regulates NBFCs. Statement 4 is partially correct. While the RBI influences interest rates, it doesn't directly set interest rates on government bonds.  The government and the RBI interact, but the RBI doesn't have direct authority in this area.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1.  They buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks.
2.  They are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, envisages their registration and regulation by the RBI.
4.  They are required to resolve assets within a maximum of 5 years.

How many of the above statements accurately describe ARCs in India?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; ARCs acquire NPAs from banks. Statement 2 is incorrect; ARCs are regulated by the RBI, not SEBI. Statement 3 is correct; the SARFAESI Act designates the RBI as the regulator. Statement 4 is incorrect; ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, to resolve assets.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following about the  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1. It is registered with RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2. It operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
3. It was recommended by the V.S. Das working group.
4. It primarily focuses on providing credit to rural cooperative banks.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the NUCFDC?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; NUCFDC is a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Statement 2 is correct; it acts as an SRO for UCBs. Statement 3 is correct; the V.S. Das working group recommended its creation. Statement 4 is incorrect; NUCFDC focuses on urban, not rural, cooperative banks.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1. It is solely driven by the Ministry of Railways' infrastructure projects.
2.  The Digital Master Planning tool utilizes solely domestically developed GIS technology.
3. It integrates data from various ministries, including those related to inland waterways and UDAN.
4. It is exclusively based on data collected through ground surveys.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Railways is a key component, PM GatiShakti encompasses seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  It's a multi-modal approach, not solely reliant on Railways.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Digital Master Planning tool uses a GIS platform developed by BISAG-N, but it also leverages open-source technology and integrates ISRO satellite imagery. This indicates a mix of domestic and international technologies.

Statement 3 is correct. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan explicitly mentions integrating data from various ministries, including those responsible for Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, and UDAN. This demonstrates its comprehensive nature.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The plan utilizes ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps, indicating reliance on both satellite and ground-based data sources.  It is not exclusively based on ground surveys. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**2. Consider the following about India's Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by privatizing all government-owned businesses.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
3. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for the implementation of PPP projects.
4. The NMP targets a specific amount of investment over a defined period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADeX is a broader agricultural data exchange platform that provides access to various types of information, not solely credit.  It features farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crop-sown data, supporting various agricultural services.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Krishi ICCC utilizes advanced technologies such as AI, remote sensing, and GIS to provide data-driven insights for improved decision-making in agriculture.

Statement 4 is partially correct.  The MSP aims to prevent distress selling by providing a minimum price guarantee to farmers. However, it is not directly intended to ensure that farmers receive a fair *market* price.  The MSP is a government-set price, and the market price may fluctuate above or below it.


**4. Consider the following aspects of India's infrastructure development:**

1. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) are primarily aimed at improving road infrastructure.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) involves selling government-owned infrastructure assets.
3. The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) acts as a Development Financial Institution (DFI).
4. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India are primarily managed by the Ministry of Rural Development.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's infrastructure development?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 3 only (d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MMLPs are designed to improve overall logistics efficiency by providing integrated facilities for various modes of transport and logistics operations.  While they utilize road access, their focus is broader than just road infrastructure.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMP is a government initiative to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets, such as infrastructure projects, through various methods including leasing or concessions.  It does not necessarily involve outright sales in all cases.

Statement 3 is correct. NaBFID is specifically established as a DFI to provide long-term financing for infrastructure projects.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The primary responsibility for policy-level matters concerning PPPs in India rests with the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.  While other ministries are involved in specific projects, the overall policy direction comes from the Department of Economic Affairs.





Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Marrakesh Agreement:**

1. It was signed in 1994, concluding the Uruguay Round of negotiations.
2. It led to the formation of the WTO, replacing GATT.
3. It primarily focused on tariff reductions in manufactured goods.
4. It established a dispute settlement mechanism for trade disagreements.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, concluded the Uruguay Round of negotiations and established the World Trade Organization (WTO), replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Statement 4 is also correct; the WTO established a robust dispute settlement mechanism to address trade conflicts between member nations.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Marrakesh Agreement did involve tariff reductions, its scope extended far beyond manufactured goods to encompass trade in services, intellectual property rights, and agricultural products, significantly expanding the ambit of international trade regulations.  The Uruguay Round negotiations aimed to create a more comprehensive and modern multilateral trading system.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Public Stockholding (PSH) policy:**

1.  It allows governments to procure crops from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSP).
2.  The de minimis limits for subsidies are based on the value of agricultural production in 1986-88.
3.  Developing countries advocate for increased de minimis limits and changes in the subsidy calculation formula.
4.  Developed countries generally support higher PSH limits to promote food security globally.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the global debate surrounding PSH?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly represent aspects of the PSH debate.  Statement 1 accurately describes the core function of PSH: government procurement at MSP to support farmers and ensure food security. Statement 2 is also correct; the de minimis limits, which restrict the amount of subsidies allowed, are indeed calculated based on a reference price from 1986-88. This creates a major point of contention, as developing nations argue that this outdated calculation significantly underestimates their current agricultural production and thus unfairly restricts their ability to provide adequate subsidies. Statement 3 reflects the position of developing countries, who push for higher limits and a revised formula. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  Developed countries generally oppose higher PSH limits, arguing that they distort markets and provide an unfair competitive advantage to developing countries.  They often view PSH as a form of trade-distorting subsidy.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI):**

1.  India Stack comprises an identity layer, a payment layer, and a data governance layer.
2.  The One Future Alliance aims to promote DPI adoption in high-income countries.
3.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) seeks to establish a focused institution for DPI development.
4.  The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is actively discouraging the global adoption of DPI.


Which of the above statements correctly describe initiatives related to the global advancement of DPI?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the three key layers of India Stack.  Statement 3 is also correct; the GDPIR is designed to create a centralized hub for knowledge sharing and support in DPI development and implementation globally.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the One Future Alliance aims to support the adoption of DPI in *low and middle-income countries*, not high-income ones.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the EU-India TTC is actively *promoting* the development and deployment of DPI, rather than discouraging it.  The aim is to foster collaboration and accelerate the adoption of DPI in other countries.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) within the WTO framework:**

1.  The AoA includes provisions on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.
2.  Tariffication under the AoA involves converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.
3.  The "peace clause" provides a permanent solution to the issue of public stockholding for food security.
4.  Developed countries have completely eliminated export subsidies for agricultural products.


Which of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the AoA?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The AoA indeed addresses market access (including tariffication), domestic support (subsidies), and export subsidies.  Tariffication is a key element, requiring the conversion of non-tariff barriers (like quotas) into equivalent tariffs.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The "peace clause" is an *interim* solution, not a permanent one, for the issue of public stockholding for food security.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while developed countries were committed to eliminating export subsidies under the AoA and the Nairobi Ministerial Decision 2015, complete elimination hasn't been fully achieved across all member states.  There are still ongoing debates and challenges regarding compliance and implementation.


**5. Consider the following elements related to India's logistics sector:**

1.  The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 focuses primarily on hard infrastructure development.
2.  The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index ranks states based on their logistics performance.
3.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) aim to reduce the share of rail freight traffic.
4.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) are planned to enhance logistics efficiency.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the initiatives undertaken to improve India's logistics sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The LEADS index indeed ranks states based on logistics performance, and MMLPs are planned to improve efficiency.  Statement 4 is also correct: the aim of MMLPs is to integrate different modes of transport, thus improving efficiency. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NLP 2022 focuses on both *soft and hard* infrastructure development, encompassing process reforms, digitization, and human resource development, in addition to physical infrastructure.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; DFCs aim to *increase*, not reduce, the share of rail freight traffic.  They are a crucial part of the National Rail Plan 2030, aiming to significantly improve the efficiency and capacity of rail freight transportation.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s initiatives:**

1.  The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework applies to all UCBs, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) acts as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
3.  The Omnibus Framework for recognizing SROs mandates that at least one-third of an SRO's board members must be independent.
4.  RBI's new PCA framework for UCBs will be effective from April 1, 2024.

Which of the above statements correctly describe recent RBI initiatives?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The NUCFDC operates as an SRO for UCBs, and the Omnibus Framework for SROs requires at least one-third independent board members.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the PCA framework *excludes* UCBs under AID.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the new PCA framework is effective from April 1, 2025, not 2024.  The effective date is a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of regulatory changes in the banking sector.  These inaccuracies highlight the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):**

1.  It was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO.
2.  Its primary aim is to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that deplete fish stocks.
3.  It includes provisions for increased fishing quotas for developing countries.
4.  It has been universally ratified by all WTO member states.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Geneva Package?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 is correct. The Geneva Package's core objective is to reduce harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it was adopted during the *12th*, not 11th, Ministerial Conference.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the agreement aims for sustainable fishing practices, it doesn't specifically include provisions for increased quotas for developing countries.  The focus is on curbing harmful subsidies, not directly increasing quotas.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the agreement, while adopted, hasn't yet been universally ratified by all WTO member states.  The ratification process is ongoing and faces various challenges.  This question tests both knowledge of the agreement's content and understanding of its implementation status.


**8. Consider the following about PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1. It is driven by seven engines including Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.
2. It uses a Digital Master Planning tool developed by ISRO.
3. It integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.
4. It is hosted on a private cloud platform.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The PM GatiShakti plan indeed uses the seven engines mentioned, integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India data, and is hosted on Meghraj, a Government of India cloud platform.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the plan utilizes GIS technology and satellite imagery, the Digital Master Planning tool was developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics), not ISRO directly.  Although both organizations are involved in spatial data and technology, attributing the tool's development solely to ISRO is inaccurate.  This illustrates the importance of precise factual knowledge in distinguishing between closely related entities and their roles in a specific project.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's aquaculture initiatives:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) includes the development of Integrated Aquaparks utilizing technologies like Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS).
2.  Biofloc technology, an environmentally friendly aquaculture technique, is promoted under PMMSY.
3.  The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) focuses solely on marine fisheries infrastructure development.
4. The Rangeen Machhli app provides information on ornamental fish species in all Indian languages.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PMMSY indeed promotes Integrated Aquaparks and the use of advanced technologies like RAS.  Integrated Aquaparks aim to consolidate various fisheries activities in a single location, improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact. RAS, a water recycling system, is crucial for sustainable aquaculture.

Statement 2 is also correct. Biofloc is a sustainable aquaculture technique that uses in-situ microorganism production to improve water quality and reduce reliance on external inputs.  This aligns with PMMSY's focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  FIDF's scope is broader than just marine fisheries; it supports infrastructure development in both marine and inland fisheries sectors to augment fish production.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Rangeen Machhli app does provide multilingual information on ornamental fish, it does so in eight Indian languages, not all of them.  This demonstrates a partial truth that could mislead an examinee.


**2. Consider the following about agricultural initiatives in India:**

1.  KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation.
2.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) primarily focuses on providing real-time weather forecasts to farmers.
3.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes artificial intelligence and remote sensing for agricultural decision-making.
4.  Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) are exclusively for organic farmers.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Indian agricultural initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoinformatics) leverages space technology and geoinformatics for precise yield estimation, improving the accuracy of crop insurance assessments.

Statement 2 is inaccurate. ADeX's primary function is not weather forecasting; instead, it's a data exchange platform holding crucial datasets like farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown data.  Weather information may be incorporated but isn't its central focus. This is a key distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. ICCC utilizes AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture, contributing to improved resource management and productivity.

Statement 4 is incorrect. KCCs are not limited to organic farmers; they are available to all eligible farmers for accessing credit for agricultural purposes. This is a significant distractor, as it presents a plausible but incorrect limitation.


**3. Consider the following regarding Minimum Support Prices (MSP) in India:**

1.  MSP is the minimum price at which farmers can sell their produce to private buyers.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture.
3.  MSP currently covers 22 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops, as well as some commercial crops.
4.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.


How many of these statements are correct regarding India's MSP system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MSP is the minimum price at which the government *purchases* crops from farmers, not the minimum price for private sales.  This is a crucial distinction, as it affects market dynamics and farmer income security.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not solely the Ministry of Agriculture.  This subtle difference is a key distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The MSP system does indeed cover 22 crops, encompassing Kharif, Rabi, and some commercial crops.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the *sole* agency for all MSP-covered crops. Other agencies may also participate in procurement depending on the crop and region.  This is a common misconception that the question plays upon.


**4. Consider the following about India's Agricultural Export Policy:**

1.  India's agricultural exports have consistently increased year-on-year since the policy's inception.
2. The 2018 Agricultural Export Policy aimed for \$60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.
3.  The policy primarily focuses on promoting exports of processed food products.
4. The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was primarily due to reduced global demand.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's Agricultural Export Policy and its outcomes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, contradicting the statement of consistent year-on-year growth. This is a direct counterpoint designed to test factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2018 policy did indeed set an ambitious target of \$60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.

Statement 3 is partially true but misleading. While the policy aims to boost processed food exports, it also covers a wide range of agricultural products. The focus on processed food is not the *exclusive* element of the policy.  This is a subtle but important nuance.

Statement 4 is partially correct but oversimplified. While reduced global demand played a role in the decline, other factors, such as domestic supply chain issues or policy implementation challenges, also contributed.  Attributing the decline solely to global demand is an oversimplification.


**5. Consider the following statements about India's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1.  The NITI Aayog introduced the National MPI (NMPI) in 2021 using data from the National Sample Survey (NSS).
2.  The NMPI includes indicators from education, health, and living standards, mirroring the global MPI.
3.  A person is classified as MPI poor if they are deprived in at least one-third of the weighted indicators.
4.  The NMPI value is calculated solely by the headcount ratio (H).


How many of the above statements correctly describe the NMPI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While NITI Aayog did introduce the NMPI in 2021, it used data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  This is a key distinction, as the data sources differ in methodology and scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMPI does incorporate indicators from education, health, and living standards, similar to the global MPI, though with the addition of Maternal Health and Bank Account.

Statement 3 is correct.  The threshold for classifying someone as MPI poor is indeed deprivation in at least one-third of the weighted indicators.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The NMPI value is calculated by multiplying both the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), not solely by the headcount ratio.  This is a crucial detail that highlights the complexity of the MPI calculation.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF):**

1. VGF provides funding for infrastructure projects through equity participation.
2. The scheme aims to enhance project viability by covering up to 40% of project costs.
3.  VGF is primarily targeted at public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the renewable energy sector.
4. The funding under VGF is provided as a loan that needs to be repaid with interest.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the VGF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. VGF provides funding as a capital grant, not through equity participation.  The distinction is crucial because equity implies ownership, while a grant is a non-repayable form of assistance.

Statement 2 is correct. VGF does provide up to 40% of project costs as a capital grant to make projects more financially attractive and viable.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While VGF can support PPP projects in various sectors, it is not exclusively limited to renewable energy. It can be applied to a wide range of infrastructure projects to improve their viability.

Statement 4 is incorrect. VGF funding is provided as a grant, which means it doesn't need to be repaid.  This is a critical difference compared to loans or other forms of financing.


**7. Consider the following about  India’s National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):**

1. The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore in investment over five years.
2.  The top five sectors under the NMP account for approximately 83% of the aggregate pipeline.
3. The NMP primarily focuses on the privatization of government-owned enterprises.
4. Asset monetization under the NMP involves only outright sales of government assets.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the NMP?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's target is ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The top five sectors (roads, railways, power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom) do indeed account for approximately 83% of the NMP's total value.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetizing existing assets, not through privatization.  Monetization can involve various methods, including leases, concessions, and joint ventures, not just outright sales.  This is a crucial distinction.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Asset monetization under the NMP includes various methods beyond outright sales, such as long-term leases or concessions, creating a wider range of options for revenue generation.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning India's microfinance sector:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households with annual incomes exceeding ₹300,000.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
3.  The Malegam Committee's recommendations led to a strengthened regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies-Microfinance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs).
4. Microfinance institutions generally charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding India's microfinance sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's definition specifies an annual income *up to* ₹300,000, not exceeding it. This is a critical detail that reverses the meaning of the statement.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While PMMY does provide loans to MSMEs, the upper limit has been enhanced to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) in the 2024 Union Budget, for those who have previously availed and repaid loans under the Tarun category.  The statement is partially true but not entirely updated.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Malegam Committee's recommendations significantly influenced the regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Microfinance institutions typically charge *higher* interest rates compared to commercial banks due to the higher risk involved in lending to low-income borrowers.  This is a common misunderstanding.


**9. Consider the following about  the  Revised Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms:**

1. The RBI's revised PSL guidelines aim to increase the average loan size in economically disadvantaged districts.
2.  The revisions prioritize lending to large corporations in rural areas.
3. The changes encourage banks to promote small loans in economically disadvantaged areas.
4. PSL norms are primarily concerned with lending to the agricultural sector.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the RBI's revised PSL guidelines?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised PSL guidelines aim to *promote small loans* in economically disadvantaged districts, implying a *reduction* in the average loan size, not an increase. This is a direct contradiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The revisions focus on promoting lending to small borrowers in economically disadvantaged areas, not large corporations.

Statement 3 is correct. The revised guidelines encourage banks to provide smaller loans in economically disadvantaged districts to enhance financial inclusion and development.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the agricultural sector is a significant component of PSL, it also covers other sectors like education, small-scale industries, and weaker sections of society.  PSL is broader than just agriculture.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Variable Repo Rate (VRR):**

1.  VRR is a fixed rate determined by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
2.  The RBI uses VRR to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.
3.  VRR is typically lower than the repo rate but not below the reverse repo rate.
4. VRR is used for loans with durations of only one day.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the VRR mechanism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. VRR is a *market-determined* rate, not a fixed rate set by the MPC.  The market influences the rate, making it dynamic.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While the RBI uses VRR to inject liquidity, it also uses the Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) to absorb excess liquidity.  The statement only captures half of the VRR's role.

Statement 3 is correct. VRR is generally lower than the repo rate but remains above the reverse repo rate to maintain a functional monetary policy corridor.

Statement 4 is incorrect. VRR is used for loans with durations exceeding one day, usually up to 14 days.  This is a precise factual detail that differentiates VRR from other short-term liquidity management tools.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Consider the following statements regarding Prosopagnosia:**
    1. It is a medical condition where individuals take an unusually long time to recognize familiar people.
    2.  Affected individuals often mistake strangers for familiar people.
    3.  Kawasaki disease is a closely related condition.
    4. Huntington's disease shares similar symptoms.

    How many of the above statements are correct regarding Prosopagnosia?
    (a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness.  It's a neurological condition impacting the ability to recognize faces, even those of close family members.  The prolonged recognition time and confusion of strangers with familiar individuals are key characteristics.  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis affecting children, while Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with different symptoms.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


2. **Consider the following statements about the Higgs Boson:**
    1. It is a fundamental particle associated with a field that confers mass to other elementary particles.
    2. Its existence was confirmed through experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
    3. It is characterized by a significant mass.
    4. It plays a crucial role in the strong nuclear force.

    Which of the above statements are correct about the Higgs Boson?
    (a) 1 and 2 only (b) 1, 2, and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Higgs Boson is indeed a fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, which gives mass to other elementary particles (statement 1).  Its discovery was a landmark achievement at CERN's LHC (statement 2).  The Higgs Boson itself possesses mass, contrary to some misconceptions (statement 3).  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Higgs Boson is not directly involved in the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by gluons.


3. **Consider the following regarding Poliomyelitis (polio):**
    1. It is a highly contagious viral disease primarily affecting young children.
    2. Eradication efforts have been successful globally except in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
    3. The disease is caused by a bacterium.
    4.  Effective vaccines are unavailable.


    How many of the statements above are correct regarding Poliomyelitis?
    (a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Poliomyelitis is a highly contagious viral disease, predominantly affecting children under five (statement 1).  While eradication efforts are ongoing, the virus remains endemic in a limited number of countries, predominantly Pakistan and Afghanistan, not just Pakistan and Bangladesh (statement 2). Statement 3 is incorrect as polio is caused by a virus, not a bacterium.  Effective vaccines exist and are crucial in polio eradication efforts, making statement 4 incorrect.

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan uses a digital master planning tool developed by BISAG-N, leveraging a GIS platform.  It is driven by seven key infrastructural sectors: railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure. The plan effectively integrates data from various ministries to provide a comprehensive overview of ongoing and future projects. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (the Government of India's cloud), and utilizes ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps. This demonstrates a commitment to utilizing accessible and readily available technological resources.


**4. Consider the following regarding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India:**

1.  A specific unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for PPP policy.
2.  A committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline aims to generate investment through the monetization of government assets.
4. The World Bank recently released a report exclusively focused on PPPs in India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs handles policy matters related to PPPs. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative focused on generating investment by monetizing existing government assets. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the World Bank did release a report benchmarking infrastructure development and analyzing PPP regulatory landscapes across 140 economies, it was not exclusively focused on India. The report provided a broader global perspective on PPPs.


**5. Consider the following about the  Agricultural Export Policy in India:**

1.  Agricultural exports and imports in India experienced a decline in a recent fiscal year.
2.  Rice is among the leading agricultural export products of India.
3.  Vegetable oil is a major agricultural import product for India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.  Agricultural exports and imports in India showed a decline in 2023-24. Rice constitutes a significant portion (21%) of total agricultural exports. Vegetable oil accounts for a large percentage (45%) of agricultural imports. However, statement 4 is incorrect. India's ranking in global agricultural exports is 9th, not among the top five.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to accurately represent the data concerning India's agricultural exports and imports.


**6. Consider the following regarding the WTO and agricultural policies:**

1. The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference concluded without a resolution on a specific agricultural policy issue.
2.  The "de minimis" limits under WTO agreements pertain to agricultural subsidies.
3.  Developing countries advocate for changes to the formula used to calculate price support subsidies.
4.  Developed countries generally support the removal of export restrictions on agricultural products.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly reflect aspects of the WTO and its dealings with agricultural policies. The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference in Abu Dhabi concluded without a permanent solution to the public stockholding (PSH) issue.  "De minimis" limits under WTO agreements define permissible levels of agricultural subsidies. Developing countries have consistently pushed for adjustments to the formula used for calculating price support subsidies. Developed countries generally advocate for the elimination of export restrictions on agricultural products, viewing them as trade-distorting measures.

3.  India's average annual cattle productivity is higher than the global average.
4.  A specific genomic chip has been developed for cattle and buffaloes.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  India's livestock sector experiences substantial economic losses due to diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis. India ranks fourth globally in antibiotic use in animals. A unified genomic chip, "Gau Chip" for cattle and "Mahish Chip" for buffaloes, has been developed. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  India's average annual cattle productivity (1777 kg/animal/year) is lower than the world average (2699 kg/animal/year).

All four statements are accurate descriptions of the Human Development Report (HDR). The HDR is published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Human Development Index (HDI) is a central element of the HDR. The HDR comprehensively examines major global challenges impacting human development. The report includes several indices, such as the Gender Inequality Index (GII), Gender Development Index (GDI), and Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI), to provide a multi-faceted assessment of human development.


**10. Consider the following about the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1. The MPI report is published jointly by two specific organizations.
2. The MPI report covers a significant number of countries globally.
3.  India has a relatively low number of people living in extreme poverty according to the MPI.
4.  The MPI measures poverty based on multiple dimensions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report is jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).  The MPI report covers 112 countries. The MPI employs a multidimensional approach to measuring poverty, considering various factors beyond income. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India has a substantial number of people (234 million) living in extreme poverty according to the MPI report.  The other options are incorrect because they do not reflect the complete factual data regarding the MPI.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999
2.  The UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage
3.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan
4.  The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India
5.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)

How many of the above initiatives primarily focus on economic development and infrastructure in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, while protecting traditional knowledge, indirectly supports economic development by safeguarding unique products and their associated markets. UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage boosts tourism and related economic activities. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework directly aim to improve infrastructure and attract investment, driving economic growth. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) further contributes by unlocking the value of existing government assets for investment. Therefore, all four initiatives, in their own ways, are directly or indirectly related to economic development and infrastructure development in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the economic significance of these initiatives.  The question is designed to test the candidate's ability to understand the subtle yet crucial economic dimensions of seemingly diverse governmental programs.  The inclusion of UNESCO recognition as a distractor tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between cultural preservation with economic impact and direct economic policy.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK)
2.  Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches
3.  KAVACH System
4.  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID)
5.  Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)

How many of the above are specifically designed to enhance infrastructure development or safety in India’s transportation sector?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2, 3 and 5
(c) 1, 3 and 4
(d) Only 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) is a dedicated fund for upgrading railway safety infrastructure. Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches represent a technological upgrade aimed at improving railway safety. The KAVACH system is an indigenous automatic train protection system enhancing safety and efficiency. NaBFID focuses on infrastructure financing across various sectors.  The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) supports infrastructure projects' viability, but is not specific to the transportation sector. Therefore, only RRSK, LHB coaches, and KAVACH system directly address infrastructure development or safety within India’s transportation sector.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include initiatives that have broader scopes or are not directly related to transportation safety and infrastructure. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between initiatives with similar goals but different scopes within a specific sector.



**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles
2.  PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks (MITRA) Scheme
3.  Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP)
4.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)
5.  Navratna status granted to IREDA and SECI

How many of the above initiatives are directly related to the promotion or measurement of industrial performance in India's textile or energy sector?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PLI scheme for textiles, the MITRA scheme, and the SITP are all directly aimed at boosting India's textile industry. The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) measures industrial performance, including some related to the energy sector. However, the granting of Navratna status to IREDA and SECI, while impacting the energy sector, is primarily a matter of corporate governance and does not directly measure or promote industrial performance in the same way as the other initiatives.  Therefore, only three of the listed initiatives are directly related to the promotion or measurement of industrial performance in the textile or energy sector. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude initiatives based on a misunderstanding of their specific goals and impacts.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between policy measures aimed at stimulating growth and those aimed at assessing performance. The inclusion of the “Navratna” status adds a layer of complexity, testing the understanding of different types of government interventions in the industrial sector.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)
2.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)
3.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)
4.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)
5.  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)

How many of the above are primarily concerned with financial regulation, restructuring, or support for specific sectors of the Indian financial system?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2, 3 and 4
(c) 3, 4 and 5
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NUCFDC is an umbrella organization for urban cooperative banks, involved in regulation and support. The PCA framework for UCBs is a direct regulatory mechanism. PMMY provides financial support to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). ARCs handle the resolution of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the banking system. InvITs facilitate investment in infrastructure projects. Therefore, all five initiatives are directly concerned with financial regulation, restructuring, or support for specific sectors within the Indian financial system, albeit in different capacities. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more relevant initiatives, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the Indian financial landscape. The question tests the candidate's overall understanding of the various mechanisms and institutions that constitute the Indian financial system.  The inclusion of seemingly disparate elements (like PMMY and InvITs) makes the question challenging and ensures that only candidates with a thorough understanding will be able to correctly identify all the relevant options.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)
2.  National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)
3.  Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP)
4.  Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the WTO
5.  WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package)

How many of the above are primarily concerned with legal frameworks or international trade agreements related to resolving financial disputes or regulating specific economic sectors?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

DRTs handle debt recovery cases. NCLAT deals with appeals related to company law matters. PPIRP provides a framework for insolvency resolution. The AoA of the WTO deals with agricultural trade policies, impacting financial flows and disputes. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies addresses trade related to the fisheries sector.  Therefore, all four of these entities or agreements are directly involved in legal frameworks or international trade agreements related to resolving financial disputes or regulating specific economic sectors. Option (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of the relevant entities or agreements, suggesting a lack of comprehensive understanding of the interplay between legal and international trade mechanisms in economic regulation.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between domestic and international legal frameworks and their respective roles in economic governance. The inclusion of both domestic and international aspects (DRTs and WTO agreements) further increases the complexity of the question.
