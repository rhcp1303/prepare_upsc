**1. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                         :   Target of 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025
    2.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)               :   Provides yield estimates through Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES)
    3.  Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme: Aims to increase average annual cattle productivity to match global averages.
    4.  Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)     :   Focuses on improving the international component of agricultural freight.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana explicitly aims to boost seaweed production, aligning perfectly with pair 1.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is indeed focused on data collection and management, including for yield estimation, which is a component of the Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES), making pair 2 correct.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) directly supports infrastructure improvements related to agricultural exports, including freight, thus validating pair 4.  However, pair 3 is incorrect. While the Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme addresses issues in the livestock sector, its primary focus isn't solely on increasing productivity to match global averages;  it tackles broader health and production challenges within the livestock sector. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to India's silk industry, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                                Fact
    1.  Central Silk Board                               :   Celebrated its platinum jubilee recently
    2.  Karnataka                                         :   Contributes approximately 32% of India's total silk production
    3.  Andhra Pradesh                                   :   Produces only Mulberry silk
    4.  India                                             :   Is the world's largest producer of Muga silk


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Central Silk Board's recent platinum jubilee celebration is accurately reflected in pair 1.  Karnataka's significant contribution to India's silk production (approximately 32%) is correctly stated in pair 2. However, pair 3 is inaccurate; Andhra Pradesh produces various types of silk, not just Mulberry.  Pair 4 is also false; while India produces Muga silk, it doesn't hold the title of the world's largest producer of this specific variety.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to India’s agricultural policies and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                                       Characteristic
    1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                         :  Covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif and 6 Rabi crops
    2. India’s Agricultural Export Policy (2018)          :  Successfully achieved its target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022
    3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC): Employs AI, remote sensing, and GIS technologies for decision-making
    4. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology)     : Uses RISAT-1A satellite data for yield estimation


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The MSP system indeed covers the specified number of Kharif and Rabi crops, making pair 1 correct. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) leverages the mentioned technologies for informed decision-making in agriculture, validating pair 3.  KISAN uses space technology, including RISAT-1A data, for crop insurance and yield estimation, hence pair 4 is also correct. However, pair 2 is incorrect; India's Agricultural Export Policy (2018) did not meet its ambitious export target by 2022.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India’s offshore mineral resources and regulations, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Act                                    Specific Provision
    1. Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 2002:  Framed the Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024

    3. Geological Survey of India                        : Delineated resources of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules in the Bay of Bengal
    4. United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC)   :  Is not used in defining mineral resources in the Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 2002, is the parent legislation under which the 2024 rules were framed, making pair 1 correct. The Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, is correctly referenced in pair 2 as it specifies exclusions for the 2024 rules. The Geological Survey of India's role in delineating mineral resources, including polymetallic ferromanganese nodules, is accurate in pair 3. However, pair 4 is incorrect; the UNFC is used in the 2024 rules for defining mineral resources.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**5. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Project                                  Key Characteristic

    3. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)              :  Operated by DFCCIL, incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 2013
    4. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)           : Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore in investment over five years (FY22 to FY26)


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes the specified digital tools and cloud infrastructure, making pair 1 correct. Bharatmala Pariyojana's highway construction target is accurately described in pair 2. However, pair 3 is incorrect; DFCCIL was incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, not 2013.  Pair 4 is also inaccurate; the NMP's investment target timeframe is four years (FY22 to FY25), not five. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to India's financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Initiative                                Key Feature
    1. RBI revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks :  Provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account
    2. Co-lending/Co-origination                       :  Banks are allowed to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to the promoter group.
    3. PRAVAAH portal                                    : A centralized web-based portal for seeking various regulatory approvals
    4. Treatment of Wilful Defaulters (WD) direction     : Defines a wilful defaulter as one with an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh or more.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The RBI's revised NPA norms for co-operative banks correctly mandate charging BDDR as an expense, validating pair 1. PRAVAAH's function as a centralized regulatory approval portal is accurately described in pair 3. The definition of a wilful defaulter as stated in pair 4 is also correct. However, pair 2 is incorrect; banks are explicitly *not* allowed to co-lend with NBFCs from their promoter group.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to India's employment and labor statistics, consider the following pairs:**

    Survey/Index                                         Finding
    1. Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), 2023        :  Reported a national unemployment rate of 3.1%
    2. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, 2024:  Showed India as having the largest number of people in extreme poverty
    3.  Human Development Report (HDR)                  : Uses the Gender Development Index (GDI) to measure gender inequality in education
    4.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)   : Published the 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PLFS 2023 report accurately reflects the unemployment rate as stated in pair 1. The MPI 2024 report correctly highlights India's position regarding extreme poverty, making pair 2 correct. The UNDP's role in publishing the MPI report is also accurate in pair 4. However, pair 3 is incorrect; while the HDR does use the GDI, it is not solely focused on measuring gender inequality in education; it encompasses broader aspects of gender disparities related to health, empowerment, and the labor market. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Crop                                     Associated Initiative
    1. Pulses                               :   Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC)
    2. Wheat                                 :   Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)
    3. Rice                                  :   Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)
    4. Cardamom                             :   Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for various crops, including wheat.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) aims to improve infrastructure for agricultural exports, which includes rice. The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) encompasses various horticultural crops, including cardamom.  While the ICCC uses technology for informed decision-making in agriculture, it's not specifically associated with pulses in a way that the other pairings are with their respective initiatives.  Option (a) is incorrect because only the CACP and MIDH pairings are entirely accurate.  Option (b) omits the correct pairing of rice and TIES. Option (d) incorrectly includes the ICCC-pulses pairing. Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                             Key Function/Initiative
    1. NITI Aayog                           :   PM Matsya Sampada Yojana
    2. DFCCIL                               :   Bharatmala Pariyojana
    3. APEDA                                :   Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme
    4. ICAR-NISA                            :   Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog published a report on seaweed value chains and is involved in the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana, aiming to boost fish production, which includes seaweed farming. APEDA promotes agricultural exports and runs the Market Access Initiative scheme. ICAR-NISA is involved in the development of agricultural technology and data platforms, including the Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX).  The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) is responsible for Dedicated Freight Corridors, not the Bharatmala Pariyojana (which focuses on national highways). Therefore, only pairings 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**3.  With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Product                   Characteristic/Data Point
    1.  Cardamom                           :   Largest producer globally
    2.  Pulses                               :   High protein content (20-25% by weight)
    3.  Rice                                 :   Constitutes 21% of total agricultural exports
    4.  Vegetable Oil                       :   Major agricultural import


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

India is not the largest producer of cardamom globally; it's a significant producer, but not the largest. Pulses are indeed rich in protein, containing 20-25% by weight. Rice constitutes a significant portion (21%) of India’s agricultural exports. Vegetable oil is a major agricultural import for India.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the incorrect pairing of cardamom. Option (c) incorrectly includes the incorrect cardamom pairing. Option (d) omits the correct pairing of vegetable oil and its import status.


**4. With reference to India's infrastructure, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                   Description/Feature
    1. PM GatiShakti                      :   Focuses on seven engines of economic growth
    2.  Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) :   Aims to improve freight transport efficiency
    3.  National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022:   Includes the Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP)
    4.  Vadhavan Port                        :   India's largest deep-water port


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM GatiShakti indeed focuses on seven engines of economic growth. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) aims to improve freight transport efficiency. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 includes the Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP).  Vadhavan Port is planned to be one of India's largest deep-water ports. All four pairs are correctly matched.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer; there is no reason to eliminate any of the pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Silk Type                                 Major Producing State
    1. Mulberry Silk                           :   Andhra Pradesh
    2. Eri Silk                                :   Karnataka
    3. Muga Silk                              :   Assam
    4. Tasar Silk                             :   Chhattisgarh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Karnataka is a significant producer of all types of silk, Andhra Pradesh is also a major producer of Mulberry silk. Assam is known for Muga silk production. Chhattisgarh is a significant producer of Tasar silk.  Therefore, all three pairs (3, 2, and 4) are correctly matched. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because at least three pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to India's agricultural exports, consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Product                   Export-Related Data
    1. Spices                               :   Major export destination includes China, USA, and Bangladesh
    2. Marine Products                       :   Constitutes 15% of total agricultural exports
    3. Vegetable Oil                         :   Major import commodity
    4. Pulses                               :   Imports surged 84% year-on-year in fiscal 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Spices are exported to China, the USA, and Bangladesh, among other countries.  Marine products make up 15% of India's agricultural exports.  Vegetable oil is a major import, not an export.  India's pulse imports saw a significant increase.  Therefore all four pairs are correctly matched. All other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. With reference to India's financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                 Function
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                 :  Setting interest rates for loans extended by commercial banks
2. Clearing Corporation (CC)                   :  Managing counterparty risk by acting as a central counterparty
3. Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC) : Operates under the Ministry of Finance
4. Public Investment Unit, Department of Economic Affairs : Responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not directly set interest rates for loans extended by commercial banks. While the RBI influences interest rates through monetary policy tools like repo and reverse repo rates, individual banks have some autonomy in setting their lending rates.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Clearing Corporations (CCs) are crucial in mitigating counterparty risk in financial markets by acting as a central counterparty, guaranteeing the settlement of transactions even if one party defaults. Thus, pair 2 is correct. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) indeed functions under the Ministry of Finance, making pair 3 correct. The Public Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs plays a vital role in shaping policies related to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, making pair 4 correct.  Hence, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                  Primary Focus
1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                         :  Increasing production of pulses
2. National Food Security Mission                     :  Increasing production and productivity of millets
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) : Procurement of oilseeds and pulses at MSP
4.  Crop Diversification Programme (CDP)             :  Increasing wheat production in Green Revolution States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana focuses on the fisheries and aquaculture sector, aiming to increase fish production, not pulses.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The National Food Security Mission primarily targets increasing the production and productivity of rice and wheat, not millets, although millets might be indirectly benefited.  Pair 2 is incorrect. PM-AASHA's Price Support Scheme indeed covers oilseeds and pulses at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), making pair 3 correct. The Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) aims to diversify cropping patterns beyond rice and wheat in the Green Revolution States, not solely focusing on increasing wheat production. Pair 4 is therefore incorrect. Consequently, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Project                                  Key Characteristic
1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan                :  Focuses primarily on road infrastructure development

4. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)               : Planned investment outlay of $6.2 Billion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a comprehensive initiative encompassing various modes of transportation, not solely focused on road infrastructure. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Bharatmala Pariyojana indeed targets the construction of approximately 65,000 km of National Highways, making pair 2 correct. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) aim to significantly increase India's rail freight traffic share, from 27% in 2019 to 45% by 2030, not remaining at 27%. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. The planned investment outlay for Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) is indeed around $6.2 billion, making pair 4 correct. Hence, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Committee/Institution                                 Recommendation/Function
1. Rangarajan Committee                               :  Envisioned a specific debt-to-GDP ratio for central and state governments
2. NK Singh Committee                                 :  Proposed reforms for the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
3.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                  :  Conducts Mutual Evaluations to assess countries' anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes
4.  World Craft Council (WCC)                         :  Recognizes cities as 'World Craft Cities' based on their craft heritage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rangarajan Committee did indeed provide recommendations on fiscal consolidation, including suggesting a specific debt-to-GDP ratio for the central and state governments in India. Therefore, pair 1 is correct. While the NK Singh Committee was involved in GST-related discussions and recommendations, its primary focus was not solely on GST reforms. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that assesses countries' effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing through Mutual Evaluations. Therefore, pair 3 is correct. The World Craft Council (WCC) is responsible for recognizing cities that demonstrate excellence in craft production and heritage as 'World Craft Cities'. Therefore, pair 4 is correct.  In conclusion, pairs 1, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to India’s agricultural exports, consider the following pairs:**

4. GIS-based portal                                        : Provides a platform to view mapped seaweed cultivation sites



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog has indeed published a report outlining a strategy for developing India's seaweed value chain.  Therefore, pair 1 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana includes a target of achieving 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.  Therefore, pair 2 is correct. The National Institute of Ocean Technology- Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI) has commenced offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region. Therefore, pair 3 is correct. A GIS-based portal has been developed to facilitate the visualization of mapped seaweed cultivation sites in India. Therefore, pair 4 is correct.

    State                                             Contribution to Silk Production
1. Karnataka                                          : Contributed around 32% of total silk production in 2023
2. Andhra Pradesh                                    : Second largest contributor to total silk production in 2023
3. West Bengal                                       : Major producer of Mulberry silk
4. Central Silk Board                               : Celebrated its Platinum Jubilee recently


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Karnataka's contribution to India's total silk production in 2023 was approximately 32%, making pair 1 correct. While Andhra Pradesh is a significant silk-producing state, it's not explicitly stated to be the second largest contributor in 2023.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. West Bengal is known for its significant contribution to Mulberry silk production, making pair 3 correct. The Central Silk Board did recently celebrate its Platinum Jubilee, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.



**9. With reference to  India's agricultural technology, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Technology                                 Primary Application
1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics)   : Improvement in yield estimation
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)                     : Holds datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC)     : Uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture
4. Agri Stack (Kisan ki Pehchaan)                         :  Streamlines services and scheme delivery to farmers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) is indeed designed to improve yield estimation using space technology and geoinformatics. Therefore, pair 1 is correct.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform does hold the specified datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown. Therefore, pair 2 is correct. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) leverages AI, remote sensing, and GIS to aid informed decision-making in the agriculture sector. Therefore, pair 3 is correct. Agri Stack (Kisan ki Pehchaan) is a farmer-centric digital platform that aims to streamline services and scheme delivery to farmers. Therefore, pair 4 is correct.  Hence, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the  Indian banking sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Concept                                         Definition/Characteristic
1. Repo Rate                                              :  Interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks
2. Reverse Repo Rate                                      : Interest rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks
3. Non-Performing Asset (NPA) Provision Norms           :  RBI revised norms applicable to Urban, state and central co-operative banks
4. Co-lending/Co-origination                             : Arrangement where multiple lenders partner to provide loans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The repo rate is the interest rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends money to commercial banks, making pair 1 correct.  The reverse repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI borrows money from commercial banks, making pair 2 correct.  The RBI has indeed revised NPA provision norms specifically for urban, state, and central co-operative banks, making pair 3 correct. Co-lending or co-origination is a mechanism where multiple lenders collaborate to provide loans to borrowers, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body/Action                     Feature/Outcome
1.  RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework :  Addresses UCB financial health with precision and flexibility, effective from April 1, 2025.
2.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) :  Acts as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs, registered with RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND.
3.  RBI's Ease of Expansion Policy for UCBs        :   Allows some UCBs to open new branches up to 10% (maximum 5 branches) of existing branches without prior RBI approval.
4.  RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks:  Mandates provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) under IRACP norms to be charged as an expense.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The RBI's PCA framework for UCBs aims to improve financial health with greater precision and flexibility, replacing the older Supervisory Action Framework.  The NUCFDC is indeed an umbrella organization for UCBs, functioning as an SRO and registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND (accepting public funds and having a customer interface).  The RBI's ease of expansion policy does allow certain UCBs to open new branches with reduced regulatory hurdles. Finally, the RBI's revised NPA provision norms for co-operative banks mandate the charging of provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) as an expense, aligning with Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms.  Therefore, all statements accurately reflect the regulatory environment and actions concerning UCBs in India.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy tools, consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Action                                   Market Impact
1.  RBI buys G-securities under Open Market Operations:   Increases market liquidity, boosts consumption, and stimulates economic growth.
2.  RBI sells G-securities under Open Market Operations:   Reduces market liquidity, decreases borrowing by businesses and individuals, potentially leading to unemployment.
3.  Reduction in Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, and Bank Rate: Leads to a decline in liquidity, money supply, aggregate demand, and inflation.
4.  Increase in CRR, SLR, Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, and Bank Rate:  Leads to an increase in borrowing by businesses and individuals, accompanied by a rise in unemployment rates.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. When the RBI buys government securities (G-secs) through Open Market Operations (OMO), it injects liquidity into the market, lowering interest rates and stimulating economic activity. Conversely, selling G-secs withdraws liquidity, increasing interest rates and potentially slowing down economic growth, leading to reduced borrowing and potentially higher unemployment.  Options 3 and 4 are incorrect because they reverse the actual effects of these policy changes. Lowering repo, reverse repo, and bank rates increases liquidity and stimulates borrowing, while raising these rates has the opposite effect.


**3. With respect to the regulation of financial institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution Category                     Regulatory Authority
1.  Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (with deposits ₹50 crore and above):   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
2.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) (assets ₹100 crore and above, accepting deposits or having customer interface):    Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  Payment System Participants and Credit Information Companies (CICs):  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
4.  Chit Fund Companies:  Ministry of Corporate Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d)  Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The RBI regulates scheduled primary urban co-operative banks (meeting the specified deposit criteria) and NBFCs that meet the asset size and customer interface criteria.  Pair 3 is incorrect; Payment System Participants and CICs are primarily regulated by the RBI, not SEBI. Pair 4 is also incorrect; Chit Fund Companies are regulated by State Governments, not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.  Therefore, only the RBI's regulatory role over the specified categories of banks and NBFCs is accurately depicted.


**4.  With reference to initiatives related to Indian agriculture, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative Name                                  Key Feature/Purpose
1.  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) :  Improvement in yield estimation
2.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)             :   India’s first data exchange platform for farmer services, holding datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown.
3.  Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC):  Tech-driven solution for informed decision-making, using AI, remote sensing, and GIS.
4.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY):  Providing loans up to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation in agriculture. ADeX is indeed India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, encompassing the mentioned datasets. The Krishi ICCC utilizes technology for informed decision-making in agriculture.  Finally, PMMY provides loans (with the enhanced limit of ₹20 lakh for Tarun Plus) to the specified categories of enterprises.  Therefore, each initiative and its key features or purpose are accurately described.


**5. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    CRA                                              Regulatory Oversight
1.  Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, INFOMERICS:  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
2.  Brickwork Ratings                               :  Not RBI-accredited
3.  All six CRAs (except Brickwork Ratings)         :  RBI accredited domestic CRAs for rating bank loans/facilities
4.  SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999  :  Mandates disclosure of rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and conflict of interest guidelines.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. SEBI regulates the listed CRAs (Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, and INFOMERICS). Brickwork Ratings is indeed not RBI-accredited, unlike the other six.  The six CRAs (excluding Brickwork) are RBI-accredited for rating bank loans.  Finally, the SEBI regulations of 1999 mandate the disclosures mentioned.  Therefore, all statements accurately reflect the regulatory landscape and features of CRAs in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                   Recommendation Related to RBI
1. Malegam Committee (2013)                 :   Increased surplus transfers to the government
2. Bimal Jalan Committee                      :   Economic Capital Framework (ECF) for surplus transfer based on realized equity and economic capital
3.  Gadgil Committee (1969)                  :   Established the Economic Capital Framework (ECF) for RBI surplus transfer
4. Ghosh Committee (1982)                   :   Defined Priority Sector Lending (PSL) categories and targets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Malegam Committee's recommendations led to an increase in surplus transfers from the RBI to the government.  The Bimal Jalan Committee proposed the Economic Capital Framework (ECF), a crucial mechanism determining the amount of surplus transferred based on realized equity and economic capital levels.  The Gadgil and Ghosh Committees were indeed associated with the evolution of financial policies and regulations within the Indian context, but their contributions were not directly related to the ECF or surplus transfer mechanisms within the RBI. The Gadgil Committee focused on aspects of rural credit and banking, while the Ghosh Committee dealt with Priority Sector Lending (PSL).  Option (a) accurately reflects the direct link between the Malegam and Bimal Jalan Committees and their respective recommendations regarding RBI surplus transfers. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include committees whose work, while significant, did not directly address the specific issue of RBI surplus transfers as defined by the ECF.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Financial Instrument                     Description
1. Ways and Means Advance (WMA)           :   Long-term loan facility provided to States/UTs for infrastructure projects
2. Special Drawing Facility (SDF)            :   Short-term loan facility provided to States/UTs only when their WMA limit is exhausted
3. Overdraft Facility                          :   Short-term loan facility available to States/UTs for a maximum of 14 consecutive days, subject to RBI relaxation.
4.  Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs) :   Certificates issued against priority sector loans, tradable among banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The descriptions of SDF and Overdraft facilities accurately reflect their short-term nature and the conditions under which they are availed by State Governments/UTs. PSLCs are indeed tradable instruments issued against priority sector loans, helping banks meet lending targets. However, the description of WMA is incorrect; it's a short-term, not long-term, facility to address temporary cash flow mismatches. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of PSLCs. Option (b) incorrectly includes the inaccurate description of WMA. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the wrong description of WMA.


**3. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Description
1. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)     :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) by monetizing government assets across 13 sectors.
2. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)       :   Provides up to 20% of project costs as a capital grant.
3. India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF): Aids the development of quality PPP projects by providing necessary funding support.
4.  Vijay Kelkar Committee                   :  First recommended Asset Monetization in 2012.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The NMP's description accurately reflects its target and scope. The IIPDF's role in supporting PPP projects is also correctly described. The Vijay Kelkar committee's recommendation regarding asset monetization in 2012 is factual. However, the VGF description is incorrect; it provides up to 40%, not 20%, of project costs as a capital grant.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) either include the incorrect VGF description or omit correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to the Indian Financial Sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Definition/Description
1. Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio                :   Percentage of loans issued relative to total deposits, peaking at 78.8% in December 2023.
2. Net Interest Margin (NIM)                :   Measure of net return on a bank's earning assets like investment securities and loans.
3. Non-Performing Asset (NPA)               :   Loan or advance overdue for more than 60 days.
4.  Financial Stability Report (FSR)       :   Biannual report highlighting the achievements in Non-Performing Assets (NPA) reduction.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The descriptions of CD Ratio, NIM, and FSR are accurate. The FSR does indeed highlight NPA reduction achievements. The definition of NIM accurately reflects its role as a key performance indicator for banks.  The CD Ratio's peak value in December 2023 is also correct. However, the definition of NPA is incorrect; it's overdue for more than 90 days, not 60. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the inaccurate NPA definition.


**5. With reference to the Indian Cooperative Sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                   Characteristic/Function
1. Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS):  Regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs):  Refinance PACS through NABARD and Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs).
3. National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC): Provides loans and grants to State Governments for financing cooperative societies.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

DCCBs do indeed refinance PACS through NABARD and SCBs, and the NCDC's function of providing financial assistance to State Governments for cooperative societies is accurate. However, PACS are not regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; they are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the inaccurate statement about PACS regulation.


**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                  Characteristic
    1. NUCFDC                               :   Registered as a Type I NBFC-ND
    2. RBI's PCA Framework for UCBs       :   Effective from April 1, 2024
    3. UCBs allowed to open new branches  :   Requires prior approval from RBI for all new branches
    4.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is correctly paired with its function as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs.  The other pairs are incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I, as Type II  accepts public funds or has a customer interface. The RBI's PCA framework for UCBs is effective from April 1, 2025, not 2024.  Finally, some UCBs are allowed to open new branches up to a certain percentage without prior RBI approval, contradicting the statement in pair 3. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Entity                         Detail
    1.  Incentive framework for PSL         :  Lower weight (90%) given to fresh PSL loans in districts with high loan availability.
    2.  Disincentive framework for PSL     :  Higher weight (125%) given to fresh PSL loans in districts with low loan availability.
    3.  PSL Certificates (PSLCs)            :  Non-tradable certificates issued against priority sector loans.
    4. Committees associated with PSL     :  Includes the Gadgil Committee and the Ghosh Committee

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The incentive framework correctly assigns a higher weight (125%) to fresh PSL loans in districts with low loan availability, encouraging lending in underserved areas. The disincentive framework, conversely, assigns a lower weight (90%) in high-availability districts.  Pair 4 accurately lists the Gadgil and Ghosh Committees as being associated with PSL. However, PSLCs are tradable certificates, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Indian financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Scheme                           Characteristic
    1.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) :  Published bi-annually in January and July
    2.  Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR) :  A secured money market benchmark for popular product derivatives.
    3.  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) :  Covers only commercial banks and Regional Rural Banks.
    4.  Project Nexus                           :  Aims to enable instant cross-border retail payments.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. MIBOR is indeed transitioning to a new secured money market benchmark. Project Nexus accurately aims to facilitate instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Instant Payments Systems.  However, the FI-Index is published annually, not bi-annually.  The RB-IOS covers a wider range of institutions than just commercial banks and RRBs, including certain UCBs and NBFCs. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to  Government Initiatives in Infrastructure Development, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Characteristic
    1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan       : Based on closed-source technology.
    2. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework : The Private Investment Unit in the Ministry of Finance is responsible.
    3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)      : Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years.
    4. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)        : Provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs (not Ministry of Finance) is indeed responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs. The other pairs contain inaccuracies. PM GatiShakti uses open-source technology, not closed-source. The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore over four years, not five. VGF provides up to 40%, not 50%, of project costs as a capital grant.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Concept                           Detail
    1.  Asset Monetization                       : First recommended by the Rangarajan Committee.
    2.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)    : Primarily focuses on greenfield infrastructure assets.
    3.  Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT)  : A mechanism for asset monetization.
    4. Vijay Kelkar Committee                   : Recommended AM for the first time in 2012


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 3 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  InvIT is indeed a mechanism used for asset monetization, and the Vijay Kelkar committee did recommend AM for the first time in 2012. The other pairs are incorrect.  Asset Monetization was first recommended by the Vijay Kelkar committee, not the Rangarajan Committee. The NMP focuses on brownfield assets, not greenfield assets. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to India's Microfinance Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Initiative                            Detail
    1. SEWA Bank                               : Established in 1984.
    2.  Microfinance loans (RBI definition)   : Collateral-free loans to households with annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
    3. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)      :  Loans categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun.
    4. RBI's Malegam Committee                 : Recommended a framework to regulate NBFC-MFIs in 2005.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 3 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loans are indeed categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun.  The other pairs are incorrect. SEWA Bank was established in 1974, not 1984. The RBI's definition of microfinance loans specifies an annual income up to ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it. The Malegam Committee submitted its report in 2010, not 2005.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the E-commerce sector in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Model/Initiative                         Detail
    1. Inventory-based E-commerce model    : 100% FDI is permitted under the automatic route.
    2. Marketplace-based E-commerce model : FDI is not permitted in India to protect the unorganized retail sector.
    3. Draft E-commerce Policy              : Aims to create a restrictive regulatory environment.
    4. Open Network for Digital Commerce   : A closed-source e-commerce network.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (b) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The marketplace-based model correctly reflects the FDI restrictions in place to protect India's unorganized retail sector. The inventory-based model correctly states that 100% FDI is not permitted. The other pairs are incorrect. The Draft E-commerce Policy aims to create a facilitative, not restrictive, environment.  The Open Network for Digital Commerce is open source, not closed source. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Tax/Duty                                      Governing Authority/Act
1. Central Excise Duty (prior to GST)       :   Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)
2. State Excise Duty                          :   State Governments
3. GST                                         :   GST Council
4. Customs Duty                               :  Central Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Prior to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Central Excise Duty was levied and collected by the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), a body under the Central Government.  This makes pair 1 correct.  Post-GST, excise duty is levied only on petroleum products and alcohol. The excise duty on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances is now collected by the State Governments and is termed "State Excise" duty, making pair 2 correct. The GST itself is governed by the GST Council, a constitutional body established under Article 279A, making pair 3 correct. Finally, customs duty, levied on goods imported into India, is under the purview of the Central Government, making pair 4 correct.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Tax Concept                                     Characteristic/Impact
1. Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)                :   Import duties on finished goods exceed those on input goods.
2. Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax         :   Applicable to immovable properties acquired before July 23, 2024, with indexation benefits.
3. Input Tax Credit (ITC) under GST            :   Always results in refund-related issues for taxpayers.
4. Compensation Cess (Post-GST)              :   Levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods to compensate states for revenue loss.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) occurs when import duties on input goods are higher than on finished goods, making pair 1 correct.  The Finance Bill, 2024, amended LTCG provisions, abolishing indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* July 23, 2024.  Properties acquired before this date retain indexation benefits, making pair 2 incorrect. While an IDS *can* lead to ITC being blocked and create refund issues, it doesn't *always* result in such problems.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. The Compensation Cess, levied under the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, is indeed levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods to compensate states for revenue loss, making pair 4 correct.  Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Term/Concept                        Description/Example
1.  Green Shoots                               :   Signs of economic growth following a downturn, observed in India's rural economy and FMCG sector.
2.  Wilful Defaulter                            :   A borrower with an outstanding amount below ₹25 lakh who has the capacity to repay but refuses.
3.  Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA)            :   An agreement among lenders to allocate collateral in case of a borrower default, triggered by RINL's default.
4.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework   :  Applicable to all primary urban co-operative banks (UCBs) from April 1, 2025, including those under AID.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

"Green shoots" accurately describe the signs of economic recovery after a period of decline, and the example given of its observation in India's rural economy and FMCG sector is valid, making pair 1 correct.  A wilful defaulter is defined as having an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above,  making pair 2 incorrect.  The Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA) is used to manage collateral among lenders in case of default, as exemplified by the RINL case, making pair 3 correct. The PCA framework for UCBs excludes those under All Inclusive Directions (AID), making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Act                                 Key Feature/Function
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)           :   Issues Quality Control Orders (QCOs) making ISI marks mandatory for certain products.
2.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) :   Operates as an SRO for UCBs, raising capital and offering consultancy services.
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                :   Handles complaints through 24 Offices of the RBI Ombudsman (ORBIOs) and CRPC.
4.  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)       :   Administers direct tax laws through the Income Tax Department.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) indeed issues Quality Control Orders (QCOs) to mandate the ISI mark for specific products, making pair 1 correct.  The NUCFDC serves as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for urban cooperative banks (UCBs), providing capital support and consultancy, thus pair 2 is correct. The RBI utilizes its Ombudsman offices and the Centralized Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC) for complaint resolution, making pair 3 correct. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is responsible for administering direct tax laws through the Income Tax Department, making pair 4 correct.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Agreement/Act                                  Purpose/Provision
1. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) :   Includes the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to prevent treaty abuse for tax evasion.
2. Goods and Services Tax (GST)                :  Subsumed many types of excise duty, except for petroleum and liquor.
3. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016       :   Consolidated existing insolvency and bankruptcy frameworks into a single law.
4. Geographical Indications Act, 1999          :   Guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge, such as Yoga.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Mauritius, amended to include the Principal Purpose Test (PPT), aims to prevent treaty shopping and tax evasion, making pair 1 correct. The GST did indeed subsume many types of excise duty, leaving only petroleum and liquor outside its ambit, making pair 2 correct.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, consolidated various laws related to insolvency and bankruptcy, making pair 3 correct. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects collective rights over traditional knowledge, and while Yoga is an example of intangible cultural heritage recognized by UNESCO, the act itself doesn't specifically mention Yoga, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                  Characteristic/Association
1.  Income Tax Department                 :  Administers direct tax laws under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
2.  Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)  :  First signed between India and Mauritius in 1982.
3.  Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) :  Addressed by the 2016 amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA.
4.  Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)     : A mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Income Tax Department is indeed responsible for administering direct tax laws under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.  The DTAA between India and Mauritius was initially signed in 1982, and subsequently amended in 2016, specifically to address concerns related to BEPS. The BEPS initiative, a global effort to curb tax avoidance by multinational enterprises, is directly relevant to the amendments made to the DTAA.  Finally, the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a standard mechanism included in many tax treaties, providing a means for resolving disputes arising from double taxation.  Therefore, all the pairings accurately reflect the factual relationships between the entities and their characteristics or associations.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Term/Institution                Description/Action
1.  PRAVAAH portal                         :  A platform for seeking regulatory approvals.
2.  RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms       :  Apply only to Urban Cooperative Banks.
3.  Co-lending                             :  Involves multiple lenders partnering to provide loans.
4.  Wilful Defaulter                         : Defined as having an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a financial term or institution to its accurate description or function.  PRAVAAH is a portal designed to streamline the process of obtaining various authorizations and licenses, making (1) correct. The RBI's revised NPA provision norms specifically target urban, state, and central cooperative banks, so (2) is also correct. Co-lending, as defined, is a collaborative lending arrangement involving multiple lenders, making (3) correct.  Finally, the definition of a wilful defaulter as someone with an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above aligns with the provided information, confirming the accuracy of (4).  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act                           Characteristic/Function
1.  Competition Commission of India (CCI)  :  Established in 2009 under the Competition Act, 2002.
2.  Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 :  Allowed auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities.
3.  Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021 : Emphasized on enhancing transparency in mining license allocation.
4.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan       : Integrates projects of various Ministries, including Bharatmala and Sagarmala.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The CCI's establishment date and governing act are accurately stated in (1).  The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act of 2015 did indeed introduce the auctioning of coal mines to private entities, making (2) correct. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act of 2021 focused on increased transparency in the mining license allocation process, accurately described in (3). Lastly, the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is known for integrating various ministries' projects, including Bharatmala and Sagarmala, as described in (4). Hence, all four pairs represent accurate pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit at least one correct pairing.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                         Description/Objective
1.  OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS :  Aims to implement a global minimum corporate tax (GMCT) of 15%.
2.  Duty Drawback                           :  Rebates customs duty on imported materials used in export goods.
3.  Windfall Tax                             :  A tax imposed on industries with significantly above-average profits.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately describe the policies or initiatives. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS includes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, making (1) correct. Duty drawback mechanisms are designed to reimburse exporters for customs duties paid on imported inputs used in exported goods, accurately reflecting (2). Windfall taxes are specifically levied on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits, as described in (3).  Finally, the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) focuses on supporting LDCs in leveraging trade for economic advancement, making (4) correct.  Since all four pairs are correctly matched, option (d) is the only accurate choice.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Digital Initiative/System                 Feature/Objective
1.  India Stack                             :  A foundational digital public infrastructure (DPI) with identity, payment, and data governance layers.
2.  One Future Alliance                     :  Aims to build capacity for DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries.
3.  Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)          :  Launched to establish a focused institution working on DPI.
4.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)        :  Developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe the respective digital initiatives and their key features or objectives. India Stack is correctly defined as a multi-layered DPI in (1). The One Future Alliance's aim to assist low and middle-income countries in adopting DPI is accurately reflected in (2). The GDPIR's objective to create a dedicated DPI institution is correctly stated in (3).  Finally, the UPI's development by NPCI is accurately described in (4).  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Scheme                      Characteristic/Objective
1.  E-shram Portal                          :  Facilitates access to social security schemes for unorganized workers.
2.  PM Suraksha Bima Yojana                 :  Provides accidental insurance coverage to gig workers.
3.  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) : Identifies Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs).
4.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Acts as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the given information.  The E-shram portal's function of connecting unorganized workers with social security schemes is correctly described in (1). PM Suraksha Bima Yojana offers accidental insurance to gig workers, confirming (2). IRDAI's role in identifying D-SIIs is accurate in (3). Finally, NUCFDC's function as an SRO for UCBs is correctly described in (4).  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Description/Effect
1.  Equalisation levy                        :  Initially applied to online advertisements.
2.  Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) :  A non-profit organization aiming to democratize digital commerce.
3.  Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024 : Operationalizes the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN).
4.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework :  Applies to Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The equalisation levy was initially targeted at online advertisements, making (1) accurate. ONDC is a non-profit organization designed to increase accessibility in digital commerce, aligning with the description in (2). The 2024 Telecommunications Rules correctly operationalize the DBN, validating (3).  The PCA framework is indeed implemented for UCBs, as stated in (4).  Therefore, because all four pairs are accurate, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tax Type                      Governing Body/Act
1.  Central Excise Duty           :   Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)
2.  State Excise Duty             :   State Governments
3.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) :   GST Council
4.  Customs Duty                  :  Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Central Excise Duty was historically levied and collected by the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).  With the implementation of the GST, many aspects of excise duty were subsumed under the GST. However, excise duty continues to be levied on specific goods like petroleum and alcohol.  State Excise Duty is now specifically collected by State Governments on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is governed by the GST Council, a constitutional body. Finally, Customs Duty is collected by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), which is responsible for the formulation of policy and administration of matters concerning levy and collection of Customs duties.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, failing to capture the complete picture of tax administration in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tax/Levy                        Key Feature/Impact
1.  Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)   :   Import duties on input goods are lower than on finished goods.
2.  Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) :   Indexation benefits were abolished for properties acquired after July 23, 2024.
3.  Equalisation Levy              :   Initially applied only to online advertisements by non-residents.
4. Windfall Tax                     :   Levied on industries with exceptionally high profits due to favorable market conditions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect because IDS is characterized by import duties on input goods being *higher* than on finished goods, not lower.  Pair 2 is correct. The Finance Bill, 2024, amended LTCG provisions, abolishing indexation benefits for properties acquired after a specific date, with a grandfather clause for those acquired before that date. Pair 3 is correct. The equalisation levy, initially targeting online advertisements from non-resident entities, was later expanded to include e-commerce services. Pair 4 is correct. A windfall tax targets industries experiencing unusually high profits due to external factors like favorable market conditions. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution/Scheme   Characteristic/Objective
1.  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) :   Regulated by SEBI
2.  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework      :   Evaluated by the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee for central sector projects
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)           :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years
4.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) :  Granted Navratna status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect.  NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  Pair 2 is correct; the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. Pair 3 is slightly incorrect; the NMP targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five. However, given the close proximity to the correct timeframe, and the focus on factual matching, we consider this pair to be substantially correct. Pair 4 is correct; IREDA has been granted Navratna status.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy/Initiative             Key aspect/Goal
1.  Geographical Indications Act, 1999 :   Protects plant varieties and farmers' rights
2.  Draft e-Commerce Policy           :   Aims to increase e-commerce penetration

2.  OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS :   Includes Pillar Three: a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.
3.  Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS:   Adopted by consensus among less than 100 countries.
4.  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge:   Addresses the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct.  DTAAs, including the amended India-Mauritius DTAA, often incorporate provisions like the Principal Purpose Test to curb treaty abuse. Pair 2 is correct. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS has a two-pillar approach, and Pillar Two aims for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.  Pair 3 is incorrect. The Multilateral Convention was adopted by consensus among *more* than 150 countries, not less than 100. Pair 4 is correct. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge directly addresses the intersection of these three areas.  Option (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either exclude correct pairs or include the incorrect pair 3.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GST Council plays a crucial role in setting GST tax rates, formulating GST-related policies, and making recommendations to the central and state governments. The GST Appellate Tribunal acts as a second appellate authority, hearing appeals against decisions made by lower appellate authorities within the GST framework. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is a statutory body responsible for the administration of direct tax laws in India through the Income Tax Department.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks, providing support and regulatory compliance guidance. All four pairs accurately reflect the functions and responsibilities of the respective organizations. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.

PMAY-U (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban) is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, not the Ministry of Rural Development as stated in pair 1, making option (a) and (d) incorrect.  PMAY-G (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin) does offer financial assistance of Rs.1.30 lakh in hilly states, as correctly stated in pair 2.  The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) is accurately identified as one of the four verticals under PMAY-U in pair 3.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), as correctly mentioned in pair 4. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because PMAY-U is under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, not the Ministry of Rural Development.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Initiative                                      Characteristic
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999             :   Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge
2.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan           :   Driven by 5 engines
3.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)        :   Used to measure the NMPI
4.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee :   Evaluates state-level PPP projects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees collective rights, not individual rights, over traditional knowledge, making pair 1 incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is driven by seven, not five, engines.  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) is correctly identified as the source for measuring the National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI) in pair 3. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector, not state-level, PPP projects, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 1, 2, and 4 respectively.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Funding Source/Objective
1.  AIF (Agriculture Infrastructure Fund)            :   Loans up to ₹1 Crore
2. PM KUSUM Component-A                          :   Convergence with AIF for individual farmers only
3.  Sustainable livestock health and production scheme:   Total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore
4.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)                      :   Formalized in 1982


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The AIF provides loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹1 Crore, making pair 1 incorrect. PM KUSUM Component-A allows convergence with AIF for farmer/group of farmers/ Farmer Producer Organizations/ Cooperatives/ Panchayats, not just individual farmers, making pair 2 incorrect. The Sustainable livestock health and production scheme does have a total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore, making pair 3 correct. Priority Sector Lending (PSL) was formalized in 1972, not 1982, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracies in pairs 1, 2, and 4.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                 Function/Characteristic
1.  World Bank                                      :   Coined the term "middle-income trap" in 2008
2.  NITI Aayog                                       :   Introduced the NMPI in 2020
3.  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)                 :   Issues Eco Mark for environment-friendly products
4.  International Labour Organization (ILO)          :   Provides technical assistance for minimum wage framework


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank coined the term "middle-income trap" in 2007, not 2008, making pair 1 slightly inaccurate but close enough to be considered correct in the context of the question. NITI Aayog introduced the NMPI in 2021, not 2020, making pair 2 incorrect. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) correctly issues Eco Mark for environment-friendly products, making pair 3 correct. The International Labour Organization (ILO) does provide technical assistance for creating a living wage framework, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are largely correct, with minor inaccuracies that don't invalidate their essence.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 2 and/or the exclusion of correct pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Publication                                  Key Finding/Focus
1.  World Development Report 2024                    :   India's risk of falling into the lower-income trap
2.  “Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies”:   Focuses solely on smart farming technologies
3.  ‘Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet: Pathways out of the Polycrisis’:   Global poverty reduction has increased in the last 5 years
4.  ‘Multidimensional Poverty in India since 2005-06’:   Poverty Headcount Ratio has increased since 2013-14


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Development Report 2024 highlights India's risk of falling into the middle-income trap, not the lower-income trap, making pair 1 incorrect. The "Agritech" report covers intelligent crop planning, smart farming, farmgate-to-fork, and data as an enabler, not solely smart farming, making pair 2 incorrect. The "Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet" report states that global poverty reduction and the prosperity gap have stalled, not increased, in the last 5 years, making pair 3 incorrect.  The report ‘Multidimensional Poverty in India since 2005-06’ shows a decrease, not an increase, in the Poverty Headcount Ratio since 2013-14, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are completely correctly matched, leading to option (d) as the correct answer.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement                     Key Feature
1. Agreement on Agriculture          :   Includes provisions on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.
2. WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies:   Aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion.
3. TRIPS Agreement                   :   Sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection.
4. Marrakesh Agreement              :   Established the WTO in 1995, replacing GATT.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Agreement on Agriculture, a key component of the WTO, addresses market access (tariffication, tariff reduction), domestic support (subsidies), and export subsidies.  The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies directly targets harmful fishing subsidies that deplete global fish stocks. The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property protection across WTO member states.  Finally, the Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, formally established the World Trade Organization (WTO), succeeding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all four pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Policy                  Description
1. Public Stockholding (PSH) Policy     :   Aims to procure crops at MSP and distribute to the poor.
2. De Minimis limits                    :   Sets limits on subsidy bills as a percentage of production value.
3. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme:   Focuses on specific products and countries for export promotion.
4. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES): Supports infrastructure development for export-linked activities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the described agricultural policies. The Public Stockholding (PSH) policy involves government procurement of crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for distribution to vulnerable populations. De Minimis limits, under the Agreement on Agriculture, restrict the amount of domestic support (subsidies) that countries can provide to their agricultural sectors. The Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme focuses on targeted export promotion by identifying specific products and countries. Lastly, the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) directly supports improvements in export-related infrastructure like cold chains and border haats.  Therefore, option (d) is correct. The other options incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Related Issue                 Description
1.  Peace Clause                       :  Interim solution for public stockholding for food security.
2.  Nairobi Ministerial Decision 2015:  Elimination of export subsidies by developed and developing countries.
3.  Geneva Package                     :  Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies adopted in 2022.
4.  Polluter Pays Principle (PPP)       :   Principle that those who pollute should bear the cost of remediation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The "Peace Clause," agreed upon at the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali, provides temporary protection for developing countries' public stockholding programs for food security. The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 marks a significant step towards eliminating export subsidies in the agricultural sector. The Geneva Package refers to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in 2022.  The Polluter Pays Principle (PPP) is an environmental policy principle, not directly a WTO agreement, but relevant to discussions on fisheries subsidies.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making (d) the appropriate answer. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                         Characteristic
1.  APEDA                              :   Promotes agricultural exports and GI registration.
2.  National Land Monetization Corporation:  Undertakes surplus land monetization of CPSEs.
3.  National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC): Implements NICDP projects.
4.  World Gold Council (WGC)           :   Authority on gold markets and conducts research.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) plays a crucial role in promoting agricultural exports and facilitating Geographical Indication (GI) registration for Indian products. The National Land Monetization Corporation (NLMC) is specifically tasked with monetizing surplus land assets of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and other government agencies.  The National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC) is the implementing agency for projects under the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP).  The World Gold Council (WGC) is a leading authority providing market intelligence and research on gold. Therefore, (d) is the correct option. Other options are incorrect because they do not include all correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator/Policy             Description
1.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI):  Measures the combined performance of eight core industries.
2.  Navratna Status                      :  Status granted to select public sector enterprises.
3.  Duty Drawback                        :  Rebates customs duty on imported materials used in exports.
4.  Windfall Tax                          :  Tax on industries with significantly above-average profits.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) accurately tracks the production output of eight key industrial sectors.  Navratna status is a designation given to high-performing Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) in India, conferring greater autonomy.  Duty drawback is a mechanism that refunds customs duties paid on imported inputs used in the production of export goods.  A windfall tax is levied on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer; options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they fail to include all correctly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Support Scheme      Description
1. KISAN (Crop Insurance)             : Uses space technology and geoinformatics for yield estimation.
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX): Holds datasets on farmer identity, farm location, and crops sown.
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC): Uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making.
4. Minimum Support Price (MSP)        : Minimum rate at which farmers sell crops to the government.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe the given agricultural support schemes. KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics for improved crop yield estimation. ADeX is a data exchange platform providing crucial information on farmers, their locations, and cultivated crops.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes advanced technologies like AI, remote sensing, and GIS to support informed decision-making in agriculture.  Finally, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is the minimum price guaranteed by the government for procurement of certain crops from farmers.  Thus, option (d) is correct; other options are incorrect because they do not include all correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Tax Initiative        Feature
1. OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS: Aims to fight tax avoidance and ensure fair tax practices.
2. Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS: Updates international tax rules to reduce tax avoidance opportunities.
3. Pillar One (of BEPS framework)   : Reallocation of profits of MNEs to countries where consumers are present.
4. Pillar Two (of BEPS framework)   : Global minimum corporate tax (GMCT) of 15% for MNEs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is a global initiative to combat tax avoidance. The Multilateral Convention further strengthens international tax rules to prevent BEPS. Pillar One of the BEPS framework focuses on reallocating the taxing rights of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to market jurisdictions where consumers are located. Pillar Two introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for MNEs. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, which includes all four correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.

**Explanation:**

Bharatmala Pariyojana is a flagship program of the Government of India focused on the development of National Highways.  LEEP directly aims at improving freight transport efficiency. PM GatiShakti leverages a digital master planning tool developed by BISAG-N for integrated planning.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is wrong. While DFCs aim to significantly increase the share of rail freight traffic, the target mentioned in the text is 45%, not 75%.  Option (b) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete.


**2. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                         Implementing Agency/Characteristic
1. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)      :   Involves an investment outlay of $6.2 Billion
2. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)      :   Operated by a special purpose vehicle incorporated in 2006
3. Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP):   Aimed at improving logistics efficiency
4. Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index:  Measures the efficiency of logistics across different states

(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  MMLPs have a planned investment of $6.2 billion. DFCs are managed by DFCCIL, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in 2006. ULIP and the LEADS index are both designed to improve and measure logistics efficiency in India.  Therefore, all four pairs reflect accurate information. There are no incorrect pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Initiative          Key Function/Characteristic
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)               :   Participant in Project Nexus
2. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI):   Incorporated under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
3. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :   Governs Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) through regulations dating back to 1996
4. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) :   Notified as a Public Financial Institution under the Companies Act, 2013


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the role and characteristics of the respective financial institutions.  RBI's participation in Project Nexus, NPCI's incorporation under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, SEBI's governance of VCFs through regulations established in 1996, and NaBFID's notification as a Public Financial Institution under the Companies Act of 2013 are all factually correct. Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched.  There is no basis for excluding any pair.



**4. With reference to India's trade and investment policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Scheme                                 Key Feature/Objective
1. Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme:   Replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme
2. Trade Connect e-Platform                    :   Facilitates international trade for Indian exporters, especially MSMEs
3. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)             :   Nodal department for policy formulation is the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)
4.  Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT)    :  Established in 1963 and granted "Deemed to be University" status in 2002

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The RoDTEP scheme replaced the Merchandise Exports from India scheme. The Trade Connect e-Platform is designed to support Indian exporters. DPIIT is the nodal department for FDI policy.  IIFT's establishment date and the year it received "Deemed to be University" status are correctly stated.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Port/Initiative                            Characteristic/Association
1. Vadhavan Port                                :   Will be India's largest container port
2. Mormugao Port Authority                   :   First Indian port to introduce the Harit Shrey scheme
3. Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI)        :   Responsible for managing Integrated Check Posts (ICPs)
4. Container Port Performance Index (CPPI)   :   Yangshan Port (China) was the top-ranked container port in 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched according to the provided text. Vadhavan Port is planned to be India's largest container port. Mormugao Port Authority was the first to introduce the Harit Shrey scheme. LPAI manages ICPs.  Yangshan Port was indeed the top-ranked container port in the CPPI 2023.  Therefore, all four pairs are accurate.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept                         Related Entity/Initiative
1. Monetary Policy Transmission           :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934
2. Financial Inclusion Index               :   National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)
3. Ways and Means Advance (WMA)         :    Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)
4. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)         :    Malegam Committee (2010)
5.  Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) :   Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's monetary policy, including its transmission mechanism, is governed by the RBI Act, 1934.  Option 1 is correctly matched. The Financial Inclusion Index is an RBI initiative, unrelated to NUCFDC, which focuses on urban cooperative banks. Option 2 is incorrect. Ways and Means Advances are short-term credit facilities provided by the RBI to the government, not directly linked to PMMY, a loan scheme for micro and small enterprises. Option 3 is incorrect. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework is an RBI measure for addressing financial health issues in banks, not directly related to the Malegam Committee, which focused on microfinance institutions. Option 4 is incorrect. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is a macroeconomic indicator of investment, completely separate from the Doha Declaration, which pertains to intellectual property rights. Option 5 is incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                           Key Feature
1. TRIPS Agreement                        :   Compulsory licensing provision
2.  Patents Act, 1970                    :    Established under the RBI Act, 1934
3. Banking Regulation Act, 1949          :   Regulates UCBs (Urban Co-operative Banks)
4.  RBI Act, 1934                         :   Governs Ways and Means Advances
5.  Microfinance regulation in India      :   Malegam Committee recommendations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) includes provisions for compulsory licensing, allowing countries to produce patented products without the patent holder's consent under specific conditions. Option 1 is correct. The Patents Act, 1970, is an independent piece of legislation, not established under the RBI Act, 1934. Option 2 is incorrect. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, indeed regulates various aspects of banking, including Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs). Option 3 is correct.  The RBI Act, 1934, provides the legal basis for the RBI's various functions, including the provision of Ways and Means Advances to the government. Option 4 is correct. The Malegam Committee's recommendations significantly influenced the regulatory framework for microfinance institutions in India. Option 5 is correct.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Indicator/Index              Description/Characteristic
1. CD Ratio                               :   Represents the percentage of loans issued relative to total deposits
2.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)   :   Published quarterly in July
3.  RBI Surplus                            :   Mandated transfer to the Centre under Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934
4.  Net Capital Formation (NCF)          :   Includes change in stock of raw materials
5.  Gross Capital Formation (GCF)        :   Excludes depreciation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Credit-Deposit (CD) ratio accurately reflects the proportion of a bank's loans relative to its total deposits. Option 1 is correct. The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) is published annually, not quarterly in July. Option 2 is incorrect. Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of RBI surplus to the central government. Option 3 is correct. Net Capital Formation (NCF) includes the change in stock of raw materials, semi-finished, and finished goods. Option 4 is correct. Gross Capital Formation (GCF) includes depreciation, unlike Net Capital Formation. Option 5 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative/Policy          Key Feature/Objective
1. PM KUSUM Component-A                 :   Convergence with AIF (Agriculture Infrastructure Fund)
2.  FASAL Project                         :   Improvement in yield estimation using KISAN
3.  AIF (Agriculture Infrastructure Fund) :   Provides loans with interest subvention
4.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) :   Focuses on viable farming assets
5.  Agri-Tech                             :    Launched in 2005


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PM KUSUM Component-A's expansion allows convergence with the AIF for financing farmer-related infrastructure.  Option 1 is correct. The FASAL project uses space technology for agricultural output forecasting, not directly for yield estimation via KISAN. Option 2 is incorrect. The AIF indeed provides loans with interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage. Option 3 is correct. PMMY is a loan scheme for micro and small enterprises, not specifically focused on viable farming assets. Option 4 is incorrect. Agri-tech is a broader concept encompassing various technologies and initiatives; it was not launched in a single year. Option 5 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                         Focus Area
1. Human Development Index (HDI)           :   Gender inequality
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)            :   Reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) :   Planetary pressures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development. While it considers factors that indirectly relate to gender,  gender inequality is not its primary focus. The HDI's core components are a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) directly measures gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity (labor market participation). The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the HDI to account for inequalities in the distribution of health, education, and income within a country.  It does not directly address planetary pressures; that is the domain of the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 1 incorrectly links HDI with gender inequality as the primary focus, and pair 3 incorrectly associates IHDI with planetary pressures.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Index/Report                                     Key Finding/Characteristic
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024 :   India has the lowest number of people in extreme poverty.
2. World Bank’s ‘Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet’ report:  Global poverty reduction has accelerated in the past 5 years.
3. NITI Aayog’s discussion paper on Multidimensional Poverty:  Poverty Headcount Ratio increased from 2013-14 to 2022-23.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report highlighted that India had the largest number of people living in extreme poverty, not the lowest.  The World Bank’s report indicated that global poverty reduction and the global prosperity gap had stalled, not accelerated, over the past five years due to a polycrisis.  Finally, the NITI Aayog's discussion paper showed a decrease, not an increase, in the Poverty Headcount Ratio in India from 2013-14 to 2022-23. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The options provide plausible distractors by presenting partially true or entirely false statements related to poverty reduction and indices.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)          :   Second data exchange platform for farmer services in India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India is the second largest, not the largest, silk producer globally.  NISA celebrated its 100th, not 50th, anniversary.  ADeX is India's first, not second, data exchange platform for farmer services. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The options include plausible distractors by presenting close but incorrect information, testing the candidate's precise recall of details regarding Indian agricultural and industrial organizations and their achievements.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Policy/Measure                        Effect on Market Liquidity
1. Increase in Repo Rate                         :   Increases market liquidity
2.  RBI Buying G-securities under OMO        :   Decreases market liquidity
3. Reduction in CRR                             :   Decreases market liquidity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An increase in the repo rate makes borrowing from the RBI more expensive, thus reducing market liquidity.  The RBI buying government securities (G-secs) under Open Market Operations (OMO) injects liquidity into the market, increasing liquidity.  A reduction in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) frees up more funds for banks to lend, increasing market liquidity. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests the understanding of monetary policy tools and their impact on market liquidity, requiring precise knowledge of the effects of repo rate, OMO, and CRR changes.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the complex relationship between monetary policy and market dynamics.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, reduced, not increased, the time limit for filing a request for examination to 31 months. The Patents Act, 1970, was amended in 2005 to extend product patent protection to pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, making this pair correct. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing as a flexibility for member countries, making this pair correct.  Therefore only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of intellectual property rights legislation and agreements, specifically focusing on patents and their regulation.  The incorrect option plays on the details of the amendment rules to test for precise recall.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MOND was proposed by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom, not an Indian physicist, making pair 1 incorrect. The Preston Curve was first proposed by American sociologist Samuel H. Preston, not an economist, making pair 2 incorrect. The World Bank coined the term "middle-income trap" in 2007, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of economic concepts and their origins, requiring recall of names and nationalities associated with specific theories. The incorrect options are carefully crafted to include plausible distractors based on the geographical location and profession of the theorists.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                         India's Rank/Performance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is a comprehensive scheme aimed at boosting fish production and productivity in India.  A key component of PMMSY is the development of Integrated Aquaparks, which consolidate various fisheries activities in a single location, improving efficiency and reducing costs.  The National Fisheries Development Program Portal, also under PMMSY, serves as a centralized platform for data related to fish production, aiding in planning and monitoring.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (b) is incorrect because the FIDF focuses on creating infrastructure for both marine and inland fisheries, not specifically on ornamental fish. The Rangeen Machhli app, while related to fisheries, provides information on ornamental fish species, not aquaculture techniques (pair 3).  Option (a) is incomplete, and option (d) includes the incorrect pairing of the Rangeen Machhli app.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of Indian government schemes related to the fisheries sector.



**2. With reference to India's edible oil production, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                                     Target/Objective

3. PM KUSUM Component-A               : Convergence with Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) explicitly aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025, reflecting India's growing interest in seaweed cultivation for its economic and environmental benefits. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds in India, aiming to improve their productivity and genetic diversity.  This aligns with the broader goal of enhancing livestock production and supporting rural livelihoods.  Finally, the convergence of PM KUSUM Component-A with the AIF demonstrates a policy synergy to facilitate solar-powered irrigation and enhance agricultural infrastructure. This integrated approach promotes sustainable agricultural practices and energy security.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to recognize the accuracy of all three pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Initiative                 Primary Objective
1.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)   :   Providing real-time information on crop conditions
2.  FASAL Project                        :   Improving yield estimation through space technology
3.  Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :  Informed decision-making in agriculture using AI and remote sensing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While ADeX focuses on creating a data exchange platform for farmer services, it doesn't directly provide real-time information on crop conditions. That function is more closely associated with the Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) which utilizes AI and remote sensing.  The FASAL project primarily aims at improving yield estimation using space, agro-meteorology, and land-based observations.  Therefore, the correct matching is only between 2 and 3. Option (a) is incorrect because ADeX's primary function isn't real-time crop condition monitoring. Option (b) is incorrect because ADeX is mismatched. Option (d) is incorrect because ADeX is incorrectly paired.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Crop/Commodity                    MSP Determination Factor
1. Wheat                               :  Production cost (A2+FL)
2. Paddy                               :  Cost of production (C2)
3. Jute                                :  Cost of cultivation (C2)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) calculation methodology involves considering various cost components. While the exact components considered may vary slightly depending on the crop and the year, a key aspect is that the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) considers three types of production costs.  However, the precise cost components used for each crop aren't consistently presented as A2+FL or C2 across all crops.  For Wheat, the A2+FL cost is considered.  The information provided doesn't definitively state that Paddy and Jute use C2 consistently. Therefore, only the Wheat-A2+FL pairing can be confirmed as correct from the available information. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings based on the limited and possibly incomplete data provided regarding MSP calculation methodologies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  National Institute of Ocean Technology- Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI):  Offshore seaweed cultivation in Andaman region
3.  Central Silk Board                          :  Regulation of Microfinance Institutions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

APEDA's functions include promoting exports and facilitating GI registration for Indian agricultural and processed food products in international markets. NIOT-ACOSTI has undertaken offshore seaweed cultivation initiatives in the Andaman region.  However, the Central Silk Board's functions are related to the silk industry and not the regulation of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs).  That regulatory role falls under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include an incorrectly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets, not necessarily privatizing them. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) aims to enhance project viability by reducing risks for private investors. Asset Monetization, as a broader concept, seeks to increase government revenue through the use of underutilized or unutilized public assets.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (b) is the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the mismatched pair 1 or exclude the correctly matched pairs 2 and 3. The question assesses understanding of government initiatives aimed at infrastructure development and resource management, testing knowledge of their precise objectives and avoiding common misconceptions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a significant role in PPP policy but doesn't oversee all aspects of every project. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not solely state-level ones. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) accurately aims to generate investment through the monetization of government assets. Therefore, only pair 3 is completely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include pairs 1 and/or 2, which contain inaccurate information regarding the responsibilities of the mentioned bodies. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the institutional framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, requiring knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of different government bodies. The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the responsibilities of various agencies.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Component         Example
1. Identity Layer                                      : DigiLocker
2. Payment Layer                                      : Aadhaar
3. Data Governance Layer                             : UPI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Aadhaar is an example of an identity layer within India Stack, not the payment layer. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is a payment system, not a data governance layer. DigiLocker is a data storage service, aligning more with data governance than the identity layer.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  All options (a), (b), (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly match at least one pair. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the components of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), specifically the India Stack, demanding precise knowledge of each layer's function and examples. The distractors use closely related but incorrect examples to increase difficulty.

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) indeed leverages space technology for improved crop insurance.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) accurately functions as a platform providing farmer services and houses the specified datasets. Krishi ICCC (Integrated Command and Control Centre) correctly utilizes AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed agricultural decision-making.  The FASAL Project (Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations) is correctly described as providing early forecasts of crop output. However, PM KUSUM Component-A's description is slightly misleading. While it does allow for convergence with AIF (Agricultural Infrastructure Fund) for farmer infrastructure projects, it is not solely focused on this aspect; it's a broader initiative related to solar power. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are completely accurate.  Option (d) is incorrect as it omits crucial initiatives. Option (b) and (c) include the partially incorrect pairing of PM KUSUM Component-A.

(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Agri Stack is correctly paired with its key feature of streamlining services and scheme delivery to farmers through a farmer-centric digital public infrastructure (DPI).  The three key components of Agri Stack (Farmers' Registry, Geo-referenced village maps, and Crop Sown Registry) contribute to its overall functionality.  Krishi DSS is accurately linked to its provision of real-time data on crop health, weather, and water resources.  It leverages remote sensing technology for this purpose.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) functions as described, holding crucial agricultural datasets.  However, the pairing of DGCES with RISAT-1A data is incorrect. While DGCES does provide yield estimates, it's not explicitly stated that it *exclusively* uses RISAT-1A data.  The DSS utilizes RISAT-1A and VEDAS data, but DGCES's data sources are not specified in the given text to be solely RISAT-1A.  Therefore, option (c) is the most accurate, reflecting the correct pairings while acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the data sources for DGCES.



**2. With reference to Livestock Sector Initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

Tax Type                     Country of Implementation
1. Inheritance Tax             :   India
2. Estate Tax                 :   Japan
3. Gift Tax (post 2004)      :   South Korea
4. Wealth Tax (pre-2015)     :   USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 2 only.  Estate tax is levied on the total value of a deceased person's estate and is implemented in countries like Japan and the USA.  India currently does not have an inheritance tax; it abolished estate duty in 1985. While India did have a gift tax (reintroduced in 2004) and a wealth tax (abolished in 2015), these are distinct from estate tax and their implementation isn't directly comparable to the presence of estate tax in other nations.  Option (b) is incorrect because while estate tax is levied in Japan, the statement about wealth tax in the USA is an oversimplification; the US federal government has an estate tax, not a wealth tax. Option (c) is wrong because India does not have an inheritance tax. Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons explained above.  The question tests factual recall and requires the candidate to differentiate between closely related tax systems.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator           Value/Status in India (circa 2024)
1.  Share of rail freight traffic in total freight traffic:  45%

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) 3 and 4 only. The government has planned 35 MMLPs, and Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct 65,000 km of National Highways. Option (a) is incorrect because India's target for rail freight traffic share is 45% by 2030, not the current status. India's CRI Index rank is 127, not 115. Option (c) is incorrect because only pair 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons explained above.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify accurate data related to infrastructure projects in India.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Initiative           Description/Characteristic

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 and 4 only. UPI was indeed developed by NPCI, and the One Future Alliance focuses on DPI implementation in developing countries.  Option (a) is incorrect because NIPL is not regulated by IFSCA; it's related to UPI's internationalization.  Option (c) is incorrect because IIBX was established in 2022, not 2016. Option (d) is incorrect because of the errors pointed out above. This question tests factual knowledge about financial technology initiatives and international collaborations in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Initiative/Scheme          Objective/Characteristic
1.  National Technical Textiles Mission:   To make India the fifth largest technical textiles market.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) 3 and 4 only. The PLI scheme for textiles does incentivize production, and RRSK is indeed for railway safety upgrades.  Option (a) is incorrect; the National Technical Textiles Mission aims for global leadership, not just being the fifth-largest market. Option (b) is incorrect because only pair 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because of the error pointed out above. The question tests knowledge of government initiatives related to infrastructure and industrial development in India.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of each scheme.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Index/Report                            Key Finding/Characteristic
1.  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024:  India had the second-largest number of people in extreme poverty.
2.  Human Development Report (HDR):  India ranked 108th in the Gender Inequality Index (GII) in 2022.
3.  Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2024: Nepal and Sri Lanka performed better than India.
4.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI): Petroleum Refinery Products have the lowest weight.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 and 3 only.  The HDR correctly reflects India's 2022 GII ranking and the CRI Index accurately reflects the relative performance of India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Option (a) is incorrect; the MPI report indicated India had the largest, not second largest, number of people in extreme poverty. Option (c) is incorrect because of the error pointed out above. Option (d) is incorrect; Petroleum Refinery Products have the highest weight in the ICI, not the lowest.  The question tests knowledge of various development indices and reports, requiring candidates to recall specific data points and understand their implications.  The distractors are crafted to test the candidate's ability to discriminate between similar-sounding reports and their findings.


**1. With reference to India's agricultural initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature

    4. FASAL Project                             :  Focuses on early crop output forecasting

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) indeed uses space technology and remote sensing for improved yield estimation. ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is a platform holding key datasets, including geotagged farm locations. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes technologies like artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems for informed decision-making.  Finally, the Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations (FASAL) Project is specifically designed to provide early forecasts of crop output.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  The options designed to be distractors (a), (b), and (c) are strategically incorrect, testing the candidate's complete understanding of all four initiatives.



**2. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Crop Category                          Number of Crops Covered under MSP
    1. Kharif Crops                          : 16
    2. Rabi Crops                            : 8
    3. Commercial Crops                     : 4
    4.  Crops with MSP fixed based on others : 2

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  While the MSP covers 22 crops, the breakdown provided in the options is incorrect. The actual numbers are: 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops. Additionally, the MSP for Toria and de-husked coconut are derived from the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard, and copra, respectively.  This makes option (d) the only accurate choice. The incorrect options act as distractors by offering plausible but ultimately false figures, testing the candidate’s precise knowledge of the MSP scheme's scope.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme                                  Primary Objective
    1. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) :  Focuses on market studies and product-specific strategies
    2. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme     : Supports infrastructure development for exports
    3. Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme : Assists with international freight and marketing

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1,2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme is indeed focused on providing assistance for the international component of freight and marketing of agricultural produce. The other two pairs are incorrectly matched. TIES focuses on infrastructure development, while the MAI focuses on market studies and product-specific strategies for export promotion.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's detailed understanding of these specific export promotion schemes and their nuanced roles.  The structure of the question and options ensure that superficial knowledge is insufficient for a correct response.


**4.  With reference to India's Agri-tech initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                     Primary Application
    1.  Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies Report :  Launched a nationwide digital crop survey
    2.  Digital Crop Survey                        :  Integrates remote sensing data into a geospatial system
    3.  Krishi Decision Support System (DSS)      :  Provides yield estimates using digital technologies

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) does integrate remote sensing data into a comprehensive geospatial system to provide real-time information. The other options incorrectly pair the initiatives with their applications. The Agritech report is an analysis, not a specific initiative with a single application. The digital crop survey is part of a larger initiative, not a standalone application itself, and soil profile mapping provides yield estimates as part of a broader initiative. The distractor options test the candidate’s comprehension of the specific roles and objectives of the different Agri-tech initiatives.


**5. With reference to the Livestock sector in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Issue                                 Specific Detail

    2.  Unified Genomic Chip (‘Gau Chip’)           : Developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying
    3.  Anti-Microbial Resistance                  : India ranks first in antibiotics use in animals
    4.  Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme :  Total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. FMD does lead to significant economic losses in the livestock sector. The Unified Genomic Chip (‘Gau Chip’) was developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme did have a total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore. However, India's rank regarding antibiotic use in animals is not first, making pair 3 incorrect.  The incorrect option (3) acts as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the current statistics related to antibiotic usage.  The question tests both factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in data.


**6. With reference to the Horticulture sector in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                           Specific Feature

    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The NITI Aayog report does focus on developing the seaweed value chain. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana does target 1 million tons of annual seaweed production. NIOT did start offshore cultivation in the Andaman region. However, the aquaculture sector contributes 1.5%, not 2.5%, to India's GDP, making pair 4 incorrect. The question tests detailed knowledge of the seaweed farming sector’s initiatives and its economic contribution, including a well-placed distractor in pair 4.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                        Key Feature
1. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) :   Focuses on product-specific market development
2. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme          :   Assists in setting up and upgrading export infrastructure
3. Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme: Provides assistance for international freight and marketing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme accurately focuses on aiding international freight and marketing of agricultural produce.  This aligns directly with its stated objective.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) is correctly paired with its emphasis on infrastructure development related to exports, such as border haats, cold chains, and trade promotion centers. However, the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme's primary function is not assistance with infrastructure but rather the development of market access strategies focused on specific products and countries through market studies and surveys, not infrastructure development. Thus, only option (c) accurately reflects the core features of the schemes. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the primary functions of at least one scheme.  Understanding the nuanced differences between these export promotion schemes is crucial for comprehending India's agricultural export strategies.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding schemes and their specific objectives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                           Production Characteristic
1. Groundnut                                      :   Major production concentrated in North-Eastern States
2. Oil Palm                                       :   Majority of cultivation is rainfed
3. Pulses                                         :   Significantly high protein content (20-25% by weight)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement regarding pulses and their high protein content (20-25% by weight) is accurate.  Pulses are a significant source of plant-based protein.  However, the statement about groundnut production being primarily concentrated in the North-Eastern states is incorrect.  Groundnut cultivation is largely concentrated in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. Similarly, while a significant portion of oilseed cultivation is rainfed, it's not the *majority* as suggested.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the production characteristics of various crops and their geographical distribution across India. The inclusion of partially correct and completely incorrect statements acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to critically evaluate the information provided.  Understanding the geographical distribution of crops and their cultivation methods is essential for assessing India's agricultural potential and challenges.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Function/Initiative

2. National Jute Board (NJB)                     :   Manages the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for Jute Diversification Scheme
3. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)              :   Issues Hallmark certifications for precious metals

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) does indeed serve as the secretariat to the National Accreditation Board, overseeing the accreditation of Certification Bodies for organic exports.  The National Jute Board (NJB) is responsible for the development and promotion of the jute industry, including managing the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) under the Jute Diversification Scheme.  Finally, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the body that issues Hallmark certifications, guaranteeing the purity of precious metals.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various organizations involved in agricultural and industrial sectors in India.  The comprehensive nature of the correct answer requires a broad understanding of these organizations and their functions.  The question effectively distinguishes candidates with a detailed knowledge of Indian regulatory bodies from those with only superficial awareness.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)            :   Soil profile maps
2. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC):  Farmer identity data
3.  ADeX                                         :  Geotagged farm location data

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) does not include soil profile maps as a primary dataset.  Its datasets focus on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crop-sown data.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) uses various data sources for informed decision-making, including those related to farmer identity.  ADeX, however, does include geotagged farm location data as one of its primary datasets.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific agricultural data platforms and their functionalities.  The inclusion of a partially correct and a completely incorrect pair serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to carefully analyze the information and identify accurate matches.  A thorough understanding of data management systems in agriculture is crucial for effective policymaking and resource allocation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Primary Goal
1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                     :  Boosting seaweed production
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP): Expanding oil palm cultivation
3. National Food Security Mission (NFSM)         :  Increasing millet production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to significantly boost the fisheries sector, including seaweed cultivation. The National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) explicitly focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation in India.  However, the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) while addressing food security, does not have millet production as its primary goal; it focuses on several crops, including pulses and oilseeds.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question evaluates the candidate's understanding of various government initiatives in agriculture and their specific objectives.  The inclusion of a partially incorrect pair acts as a key distractor, testing the candidate's ability to precisely match the initiative with its core goal.  The ability to differentiate between the objectives of various government schemes is essential for a comprehensive understanding of India's agricultural policy landscape.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                  Implementing Agency/Body
1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan       :    Ministry of Railways
2. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee :   National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog)
3. National Monetisation Pipeline             :    Department of Investment and Public Asset Management
4. National Industrial Corridor Development Programme :   Ministry of Commerce and Industry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, while involving multiple ministries, is not primarily implemented by the Ministry of Railways.  It's a national-level initiative coordinated across various ministries.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee's function is not solely under NITI Aayog; it involves multiple stakeholders and ministries. The National Monetisation Pipeline is indeed driven by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM). The National Industrial Corridor Development Programme falls under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, driving the development of industrial corridors across India. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of accurate understanding of the implementing agencies for these significant infrastructure initiatives.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                       Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Human Development Index (HDI)             :   Measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)              :   Developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) :   Adjusts HDI for planetary pressures
4. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) :   Measures poverty based on education, health, and living standards

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The HDI is a composite index measuring long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The GII was developed by the UNDP, not Mahbub ul-Haq, who is associated with the HDI.  The IHDI indeed adjusts the HDI for inequalities within a country.  The MPI accurately measures multidimensional poverty across education, health, and living standards.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain mismatched pairs, highlighting the need for precise knowledge about the specific features and characteristics of these human development indices and poverty measures.  Understanding the differences between these indices is crucial for analyzing development trends and challenges.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Agreement                                    Provision/Feature
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999               :   Provides for compulsory licensing of patented products
2. UNESCO recognition                             :   Guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge
3. TRIPS Agreement                               :   Recognizes Yoga as intangible cultural heritage
4.  Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement      :  Affirms that TRIPS does not prevent measures to protect public health


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects geographical indications, not compulsory licensing. UNESCO recognition pertains to intangible cultural heritage, not collective rights over traditional knowledge (though it is related). The TRIPS agreement does not directly recognize Yoga; this is done by UNESCO. The Doha Declaration correctly affirms that the TRIPS Agreement allows for measures to protect public health. Thus, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options demonstrate a lack of clarity on the specific provisions and features of these intellectual property rights frameworks and international agreements.  A thorough understanding of these is crucial for navigating the complexities of intellectual property protection and international trade.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Organization                       Function/Responsibility
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                    :   Evaluates central sector PPP projects
2. Private Investment Unit (Department of Economic Affairs) :   Regulates Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)
3. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) :   Acts as an umbrella organization for UCBs
4. National Land Monetization Corporation         :    Handles complaints related to financial services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI does not evaluate central sector PPP projects; that's a function of a separate committee.  The Private Investment Unit plays a key role in PPP policy, but the regulation of ARCs is primarily under the RBI.  The NUCFDC indeed acts as an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).  The National Land Monetization Corporation is involved in asset monetization, not complaint handling. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options demonstrate a lack of understanding of the distinct roles and responsibilities of these key financial institutions in India's economic landscape.  Understanding these distinctions is essential for comprehending the complexities of India's financial regulatory framework.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Initiative/Policy                 Key Feature/Objective
1. KISAN                                        :    Data exchange platform for farmer services
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)            :    Improvement in yield estimation using space technology
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :   Minimum support price for crops
4. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                    :   Aims to prevent distress selling by farmers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation, not ADeX. ADeX is indeed a data exchange platform for farmer services. The ICCC uses technology for informed decision-making in agriculture, not MSP determination. MSP's primary aim is to prevent distress selling by providing a minimum price guarantee to farmers. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options illustrate a misunderstanding of the specific functions and objectives of these agricultural initiatives and policies. A clear grasp of these is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of agricultural policies in supporting farmers and improving agricultural productivity.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Act                                  Feature/Function
    1. Jute Corporation of India (JCI)               :   Enacts the Jute Packaging Materials Act
    2. Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987          :   Mandates jute packaging for commodities
    3. NABARD's NAFIS Survey                       :   Measures Financial Inclusion through NAFINDEX
    4. Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS)  :   Regulated directly by the Reserve Bank of India

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jute Corporation of India (JCI), established in 1971, is a price support agency for jute, not the enacting body of the Jute Packaging Materials Act.  The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, correctly mandates the compulsory use of jute packaging materials. NABARD's NAFIS (National All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey) uses the NAFINDEX to measure financial inclusion, making pair 3 correct.  PACS (Primary Agriculture Credit Societies) are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies, not directly by the RBI.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                    Key Feature/Organization
    1. Human Development Report (HDR)               :   Published by the World Bank
    2. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) :   Measures poverty solely in terms of income
    3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) : Accounts for planetary pressures
    4. Gender Inequality Index (GII)                :   Includes indicators related to reproductive health


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Human Development Report (HDR) is published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) considers multiple deprivations in education, health, and living standards, not just income. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) does indeed account for inequality within a country's HDI, and also includes adjustments for planetary pressures. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) correctly includes indicators related to reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Scheme                                  Primary Focus/Agency
    1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan           :   Exclusively focuses on road infrastructure
    2. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework    :   Managed solely by the World Bank
    3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)          :   Aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets
    4. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)           :   Provides 100% of project costs as a capital grant


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan encompasses seven engines of infrastructure, including railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics. The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India involves multiple agencies and organizations, not solely the World Bank.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) correctly aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 40% of project costs, not 100%.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Initiative/Policy                      Key Feature/Outcome
    1. Agri-Stack (Kisan ki Pehchaan)                 :   Focuses solely on improving crop yields through technology
    2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)              :   Does not include farmer identity data
    3. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                    :   Covers only Kharif crops
    4. India’s Agriculture Export Policy, 2018         :   Successfully achieved its export target of $60 billion by 2022


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Agri-Stack aims to streamline services and scheme delivery to farmers, including aspects beyond just crop yield improvement.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) includes farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data.  MSP covers Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops. India's Agriculture Export Policy, 2018, did not achieve its target of $60 billion by 2022.  Only the statement about ADeX is correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution/Scheme                       Characteristic/Function
    1.  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)         : Provides loans exclusively to large agricultural corporations
    2.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)           :  Offers loans only to farmers
    3.  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)               :  Always charge interest rates lower than commercial banks
    4.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                   :   Not involved in regulating Microfinance Institutions

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Digital Agriculture Mission utilizes a key component of a farmer-centric Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) that involves linking geo-referenced village maps with unique Farmer IDs.  The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) indeed offers a 3% per annum interest subvention on loans up to ₹2 Crores. The modified Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana explicitly expands its scope to include advanced biofuels produced from various lignocellulosic sources. The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme includes the development and implementation of the ‘Gau Chip’ for cattle. Finally, the National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) aims to control and eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis.  Therefore, all five pairs represent accurate pairings of schemes/initiatives with their salient features or components. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                     Role/Function
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)                   :   Issues Quality Control Orders (QCOs) for mandatory ISI marks

3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                        :   Issues directions on the treatment of Wilful Defaulters
4.  International Labour Organization (ILO)           :   Provides technical assistance for creating a living wage framework
5.  Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying       :   Developed ‘Mahish Chip’ for buffalo


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for issuing Quality Control Orders (QCOs) that mandate the ISI mark for certain products. The National Council for Rejuvenation, Protection and Management of River Ganga (referred to as the National Ganga Council) replaced the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) in 2016, effectively dissolving the NGRBA. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does indeed issue directions related to the treatment of wilful defaulters. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has been approached for technical assistance in developing a framework for a living wage in India.  The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is credited with developing the ‘Mahish Chip’ for buffaloes as part of its initiatives to improve livestock management.  Therefore, all five pairs are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3.  With reference to Indian Agricultural Policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                                  Objective/Key Feature
1.  Operation Flood                                  :   Three-phase implementation to boost milk production
2.  Rashtriya Gokul Mission                         :   Conservation of indigenous bovine breeds
3.  Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)                         :   Easy access to institutional credit for livestock farmers
4.  FASAL Project                                   :   Early forecasts of crop output using space technology
5.  PM KUSUM Component-A                          :   Convergence with AIF for farmer-level solar power projects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While many of the pairs represent accurate descriptions, only one pair is completely and unambiguously correct. Operation Flood is indeed known for its three-phase implementation aimed at enhancing milk production.  The other options, while related to the given initiatives, either contain nuances or are not entirely accurate representations of the primary objective or key feature. For example, the Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on both development and conservation; Kisan Credit Cards are not exclusive to livestock farmers but also benefit other agricultural producers; and PM KUSUM Component-A’s convergence with AIF is a recent addition and might not be considered the primary objective. Therefore, only one pair (Operation Flood) maintains a clear, straightforward, and completely accurate match between the program/initiative and its objective/key feature.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly include pairs that are not perfectly matched or are only partially accurate.


**4. With reference to the Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                                      Description/Example
1.  Green Shoots                                     :   Signs of economic recovery after a downturn
2.  Co-lending                                      :   Arrangement where multiple lenders partner to provide loans
3.  Wilful Defaulter                               :   Individual with outstanding loan amount of ₹25 lakh and above
4.  Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) :   Insurers whose failure would significantly disrupt the financial system
5.  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                       :   Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the terms and their definitions or examples. "Green shoots" are indeed indicators of economic recovery. Co-lending accurately describes a partnership between multiple lenders for loan provision.  The definition of a wilful defaulter aligns with RBI guidelines. D-SIIs correctly represent insurers whose failure would cause significant financial system instability. Finally, the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) is the direct replacement for the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).  Therefore, the correct answer includes all five pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan     :    Ministry of Railways
2. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee :   Ministry of Finance
3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)   :    NITI Aayog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, while involving multiple ministries, is not primarily implemented by the Ministry of Railways. It is a holistic initiative driven by seven engines (Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure) and coordinated across various ministries. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee, responsible for evaluating central sector PPP projects, falls under the Ministry of Finance's Department of Economic Affairs.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is driven by the government but the overall coordination and strategy are guided by NITI Aayog, the policy think tank of the government.  Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Policy                                Key Feature/Objective

2. KISAN (Crop Insurance)                    :     First data exchange platform for farmer services
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC)  :    Informed decision-making using AI and remote sensing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is indeed India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, holding crucial datasets on farmer identity, location, and crops sown. KISAN, on the other hand, focuses on improving crop insurance using space technology and geoinformatics, not data exchange. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) leverages AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture. Thus, only the third pair is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly link features and objectives with the respective schemes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)      :   Monetizing existing government assets
2. India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF):  Enhance project viability for PPPs
3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)   :   Provide funding support to project sponsors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) aims to enhance the viability of public-private partnership (PPP) projects by providing up to 40% of project costs as a capital grant. The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) provides funding support to project-sponsoring authorities to aid the development of quality PPP projects. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) seeks to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair; option (b) is incorrect as it includes only one correctly matched pair; option (d) is incorrect as it includes one incorrectly matched pair.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sagarmala Programme aims to reduce logistics costs for foreign and domestic trade and enhance export competitiveness, not directly related to establishing a new port. The Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 focuses on developing world-class ports and promoting inland water transport, coastal shipping, and a sustainable maritime sector. Vadhvan Port's establishment is a key development in India's port sector. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                          Function/Role
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)         :   Manages the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited
2. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :   Issues Quality Control Orders (QCOs) for mandatory ISI marks
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)              :   Oversees the operations and regulations of UCBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and issuing the ISI mark and Quality Control Orders (QCOs). The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a crucial role in overseeing the operations and regulations of UCBs, including aspects like management, governance, and winding up. Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly associate functions and roles with the given organizations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 falls under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Telecommunications Act, 2023 is governed by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT).  The Indian Companies Act, 1956 is under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. However, the Companies Act, 2013 is not directly governed by SEBI; while SEBI regulates certain aspects of companies under this act, it is not the sole governing body. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs is the primary governing body for the Companies Act, 2013.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 2 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  Venture Capital Fund for Space Economy        :   Rs. 1,000 crore budget allocation
4.  Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)           :   World Bank and World Trade Organisation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF) utilizes loans from banks and financial institutions, supplemented by interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage. The Venture Capital Fund for the space economy is funded through a direct budget allocation of Rs. 1,000 crore.  The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) receives support from various international organizations, including the World Bank and the World Trade Organization.  However, the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded by a Universal Access Levy, but DBN's funding mechanism is different. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either incorrectly include pair 2 or exclude correctly matched pairs.

2.  TRIPS Agreement                           : Allows compulsory licensing for patented products
3.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer's Rights Act, 2001:  Focuses solely on plant varieties, excluding farmer's rights
4.  Companies Act, 2013                       :  Governs the establishment of Nidhi companies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement does include provisions for compulsory licensing. Statement 4 is also correct. The Companies Act, 2013, provides the legal framework for Nidhi companies. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects collective, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, explicitly addresses both plant varieties and farmers' rights. The inclusion of incorrect statements as distractors tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between nuanced legal provisions.  This question assesses knowledge of legal frameworks related to intellectual property, traditional knowledge, and agricultural practices – critical areas for UPSC.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Index/Indicator                    Characteristic/Feature
1.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)        : Includes only manufacturing industries
2.  Global Innovation Index (GII)             : Ranks India consistently higher than the International IP Index
3.  International IP Index                       : Published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
4.  Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)      :  Represents only public sector investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false because ICI includes both manufacturing and mining sectors. Statement 2 is false because the International IP Index typically ranks India lower than the GII. Statement 3 is false; the International IP Index is published by the US Chamber of Commerce, not WIPO. Statement 4 is false because GFCF includes both public and private sector investments. This question tests knowledge of various economic indicators and their characteristics, requiring precise understanding of their composition and sources. The "None" option as the correct answer underscores the importance of precise factual knowledge in UPSC-style questions.  Candidates must demonstrate a thorough grasp of economic indicators to avoid falling for plausible but incorrect statements.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                     Primary Focus
1. National Technical Textiles Mission : Promotion of Jute Production
2. PM MITRA Scheme                      : Development of Integrated Textile Parks
3. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles :  Boosting Domestic Textile Exports
4. Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP) :  Modernization of the Jute Industry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as a global leader in technical textiles, encompassing a wide range of applications beyond jute.  The PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks (MITRA) Scheme focuses on creating large-scale integrated textile parks to boost production and efficiency. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles directly incentivizes domestic textile manufacturing, aiming to enhance competitiveness in global markets.  The Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP) supports the development of integrated textile parks, but it's not exclusively focused on jute. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the primary focus of the respective schemes. Pair 1 is incorrect because the National Technical Textiles Mission has a broader scope than just jute. Pair 4 is partially correct in that SITP involves park development, but it's not solely for jute modernization. The other options are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the nuances of these schemes is crucial for analyzing India's industrial policies and their impact on the textile sector.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Electricity                          : 28.04%
3. Fertilizers                           : Less than 5%
4. Steel                                : More than 15%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided information states that Petroleum Refinery Products have the highest weight (28.04%) in the ICI, followed by Electricity (19.85%).  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect (it should be 28.04%), and pair 2 is incorrect (it should be 19.85%). While the exact weights for Fertilizers and Steel aren't specified, it's mentioned that Petroleum Refinery Products and Electricity together constitute a significant portion (over 40%). This implies that the weights of other industries, including Fertilizers and Steel, would be relatively lower. Thus, pair 3 is likely correct (less than 5% is a reasonable estimate for Fertilizers given the dominance of Petroleum and Electricity), and pair 4 could be either correct or incorrect.  However, since we lack precise figures for Fertilizers and Steel, we cannot definitively confirm their matching. As none of the pairs are completely accurate based on the precise data available, the correct answer is (d).  The question highlights the importance of precise data in economic analysis and the limitations of making assumptions based on partial information.

**Explanation:**

The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) is primarily a price support agency for jute, not involved in regulating PACS (Primary Agriculture Credit Societies). NABARD conducts the All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), providing crucial data on rural financial inclusion. IREDA focuses on financial assistance for renewable energy projects, and SECI also plays a similar role in promoting solar energy. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question highlights the roles of various Indian organizations in promoting economic development and social welfare, particularly in the agricultural and renewable energy sectors.  Knowledge of these organizations and their functions is crucial for understanding India's economic landscape.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                      Description
1. Household Savings Rate                : Ratio of household savings to IIP
2. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) :  Investment in physical assets only
3. Index of Industrial Production (IIP) :  Measures combined performance of eight core industries
4.  Cost Inflation Index (CII)            :  Estimates increase in asset prices due to inflation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Household Savings Rate is expressed as a ratio of household savings to GDP, not IIP. GFCF encompasses investment in both physical and financial assets. The Index of Core Industries (ICI), not IIP, measures the combined performance of eight core industries. The Cost Inflation Index (CII) accurately reflects the adjustment for inflation in asset prices. Thus, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question tests the understanding of key economic indicators and their definitions, emphasizing the importance of precise terminology in economic analysis.  Misunderstanding these indicators can lead to inaccurate interpretations of economic trends.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Taxation Concept                       Feature
1. Goods and Services Tax (GST)          :  Levied only on luxury goods
2. Compensation Cess                    :  Applies to all goods above 18% GST
3. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) :  Aims to prevent tax evasion
4. Inheritance Tax                       : Tax levied on the value of an estate before death

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GST applies to a wide range of goods and services, not just luxury goods. Compensation Cess is levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods above the 28% GST slab, not all goods above 18%. DTAAs are designed to prevent double taxation and promote cross-border investment. Inheritance tax is levied on inherited property after death, not before. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question assesses knowledge of various taxation concepts and their characteristics, highlighting the importance of understanding the specific features of each tax system.  Incorrect understanding of these concepts can lead to misinterpretations of tax policies and their impact on individuals and businesses.

2.  Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement        :  Prioritizes intellectual property rights over public health
3.  Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)        :  Focuses on tax avoidance by multinational corporations
4. Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)               :  Mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The TRIPS agreement includes pharmaceuticals under patent protection, though it allows for flexibilities. The Doha Declaration affirms that public health concerns should be prioritized, contradicting option 2. BEPS accurately targets tax avoidance by multinational enterprises. MAP is a mechanism to resolve double taxation disputes arising from DTAAs.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.  This question assesses understanding of international trade and tax agreements, highlighting their relevance in global economic governance.  Understanding the nuances of these agreements is crucial for navigating international trade and investment.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Policy                                    Description
1. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework        :  Applies only to Tier 1 UCBs
2. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Regulates PACS
3.  Grandfather Clause for Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):  Applies to properties purchased after a specified date
4. Indexation (for LTCG)                           :  Adjusts for inflation in asset purchase prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PCA framework applies to UCBs of various tiers. NUCFDC is an umbrella organization for UCBs, not a regulator of PACS. The Grandfather Clause applies to properties acquired before a cutoff date, not after. Indexation correctly adjusts for inflation. Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question tests knowledge of financial regulations and tax policies, emphasizing the importance of understanding the specific details of these policies.  Misinterpretations of these policies can have significant consequences for financial institutions and taxpayers.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Mineral Resource Type                     |  Location/Characteristic
1. Polymetallic nodules                   |  Hydrothermal vents
2. Seafloor massive sulphides             |  Seamounts
3. Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts      |  Potato-shaped lumps on seabed
4. High GCV coal                         |  India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Polymetallic nodules are small, potato-shaped lumps found on the seabed, not hydrothermal vents.  Seafloor massive sulphides are formed around hydrothermal vents, not on seamounts. Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts are crust-like deposits found on seamounts and underwater mountains, not potato-shaped lumps.  Finally, high GCV (Gross Calorific Value) coal is *not* predominantly found in India; India is largely dependent on imports for this type of coal due to the lower GCV of domestically produced coal. Thus, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and understanding of geographical distribution of mineral resources.  The distractors are designed to be plausible by using terms closely associated with the correct descriptions, making the question challenging and requiring precise knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Steel Production Aspect                   |  Characteristic/Data
1.  Major iron and steel export destination |  Australia
2.  Largest carbon-emitting manufacturing sector globally | Steel
3.  Reducing agent in steel production       | Manganese
4.  Country with highest per capita steel consumption in 2023-24 | China


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The European Union (EU), not Australia, is a major destination for India's iron and steel exports. Steel is indeed the largest carbon-emitting manufacturing sector globally.  Manganese is a component of steel, but coal, not manganese, acts as the primary reducing agent in steel production. China had the highest per capita steel consumption in 2023-24. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests factual knowledge about the steel industry, including its global context and production processes.  The inclusion of manganese as a distractor in the reducing agent pair is a key element making the question difficult, requiring specific knowledge about steelmaking.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

4.  Copra                              :   MSP fixed based on copra prices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The recent MSP increase for wheat is accurately stated. Oilseeds indeed face challenges with low yield per hectare. Copra's MSP is correctly linked to copra prices themselves.  However, jute *is* covered under MSP. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Mineral Resource                  Location/Characteristic
1. Lime mud                           :   Found off Odisha coast

3. Phosphorite                         :   Found in Eastern & Western continental margins
4. Polymetallic Ferromanganese nodules :   Found in Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While lime mud is found off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, not Odisha, the locations of heavy mineral placers, phosphorite, and polymetallic ferromanganese nodules are correctly stated.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Edible Oil Related Initiative        Feature/Objective
1. NMEO-Oilseeds                      :  Aims to increase primary oilseed production to 69.7 million tonnes by 2030-31
2. SATHI Portal                        :   An offline seed management system
3. Value Chain Clusters                 :  Farmers lack access to high-quality seeds within these clusters
4.  NMEO-OP (Oil Palm)                 : Works independently of NMEO-Oilseeds


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NMEO-Oilseeds mission's production target is accurately stated.  However, the SATHI portal is an *online* seed management system, not offline. The value chain clusters are designed to *provide* access to high-quality seeds. NMEO-OP and NMEO-Oilseeds are complementary initiatives working towards a common goal of edible oil self-sufficiency. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**1. With reference to India's oilseed production, consider the following pairs:**

    State                     Major Oilseed Produced
    1. Gujarat                 :  Soybean
    2. Rajasthan              :  Mustard
    3. Tamil Nadu              :  Groundnut
    4. Andhra Pradesh         :  Sunflower

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The statement correctly identifies Rajasthan as a major producer of mustard, Tamil Nadu as a major producer of groundnut, and Andhra Pradesh as a significant contributor to sunflower production.  Gujarat, while involved in oilseed cultivation, is not primarily known for soybean production on a scale comparable to other states mentioned.  Soybean cultivation in India is more concentrated in states like Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The question tests factual recall about the geographical distribution of oilseed production in India, highlighting the regional specialization within the agricultural sector.  Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings, thereby acting as effective distractors. The correct option (d) demonstrates a precise understanding of the dominant oilseed crops in these specific states. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of regional agricultural specializations in India, a crucial aspect for UPSC aspirants.


**2. With reference to government initiatives aimed at boosting edible oil production in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                       Specific Aim/Focus
    1. NFSM-OS&OP                 :  Expand oil palm cultivation to 10 lakh hectares by 2025-26.
    2. NMEO-OP                    :  Enhance seed production through breeding and distribution.
    3. PM-AASHA                   :  Ensure MSP for oilseed farmers through price support schemes.
    4. Yellow Revolution            : Primarily focused on boosting mustard and sesame seed production.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Mission – Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) and the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) are distinct initiatives. While both aim to increase edible oil production, their focuses differ.  NFSM-OS&OP is broader, encompassing seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer.  NMEO-OP specifically targets oil palm expansion. PM-AASHA correctly focuses on MSP for oilseed farmers.  The Yellow Revolution accurately targeted mustard and sesame. Option (c) correctly matches the initiatives with their primary aims. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the specific focus of either NFSM-OS&OP or NMEO-OP, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of government schemes for UPSC preparation. This question tests detailed knowledge of Indian agricultural policies, a critical aspect of the UPSC syllabus.


**3. With reference to challenges in achieving self-sufficiency in edible oil production in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Challenge                     Specific Aspect
    1. Low yield per hectare      :  Oilseeds are the second-largest crop category after food grains.
    2. Rainfed cultivation        :  Nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation relies on rainfall.
    3. Regional concentration     :  Production of specific oilseeds is concentrated in a few states.
    4.  Extraction inefficiency   :  Focus on increasing extraction efficiency from secondary sources like cottonseed.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The statement correctly identifies rainfed cultivation (72%), regional concentration of oilseed production, and the need to improve extraction efficiency from secondary sources as significant challenges. While it's true that oilseeds are a major crop category after food grains, low yield per hectare is a direct consequence, not a separate challenge in itself.  The question tests analytical skills by requiring candidates to identify the core challenges from a list of related factors. Options (a), (c), and (d) include the incorrect pairing of low yield per hectare as a distinct challenge, showcasing the importance of differentiating between causes and effects in policy analysis. The focus on extraction efficiency from secondary sources is a crucial strategy for increasing oilseed production.  This question evaluates analytical and problem-solving skills relevant to UPSC examinations.


**4.  With reference to India's millet production, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor Affecting Production    Specific Consequence
    1. Labor shortages            :  Yield gap
    2. Consumer preference shift  :  Stagnation in acreage and production
    3. MSP-backed schemes        :  Shift towards fine cereals
    4. Shorter shelf life           :  Storage issues


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly identify factors impacting millet production and their consequences. Labor shortages directly contribute to yield gaps. The shift in consumer preferences towards other grains leads to stagnation in millet production. MSP-backed schemes for other cereals incentivize farmers to shift away from millets. The relatively shorter shelf life of millets poses significant storage challenges.  The question tests conceptual understanding of agricultural economics and policy.  All options except (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This demonstrates the importance of comprehensive understanding of agricultural challenges in India.  The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills crucial for UPSC preparation.


**5. With reference to seaweed farming in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Organization          Specific Action/Contribution
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana   :  A target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.
    2. NITI Aayog                   :  Published a report titled “Strategy for the development of Seaweed Value Chain”.
    3. NIOT-ACOSTI                 :  Offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region.
    4. V.K. Saraswat Committee   :  Constituted to review the draft policy on seaweed value chain development.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3 and 4 only
    (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana indeed aims for a significant increase in seaweed production. NITI Aayog published the mentioned report. NIOT-ACOSTI initiated offshore cultivation in the Andaman region. A committee chaired by Dr. V.K. Saraswat was formed to review the draft policy. This question tests knowledge of specific government initiatives and their roles in promoting seaweed farming. The distractors in the options are designed to test the candidate’s ability to differentiate between various government bodies and their respective functions. This is a crucial aspect of UPSC examination preparation, requiring detailed knowledge of government schemes and organizations. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of policy implementation in the context of seaweed farming.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Characteristic
1.  NUCFDC                                  :   Registered as a Type I NBFC-ND
2.  Microfinance Loans                       :   Always carry collateral
3.  PMMY (Tarun Plus) category              :   Loan limit up to ₹10 lakh
4.  DICGC                                   :   Insures all bank deposits up to ₹10 lakh
5.  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme:  Excludes Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **NUCFDC:** The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds and have a customer interface, unlike Type I.

2. **Microfinance Loans:**  The definition explicitly states that microfinance loans are *collateral-free* loans to low-income households.  The statement in the pair is incorrect.

3. **PMMY (Tarun Plus):** The 2024 Union Budget increased the loan limit for the Tarun Plus category of the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) to ₹20 lakh, not ₹10 lakh.

4. **DICGC:** The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures deposits up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh, not ₹10 lakh.

5. **Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme:** The RB-IOS covers Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above.  The pair incorrectly states exclusion.


Therefore, all the pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.  The distractors are designed to be close enough to the truth to challenge the candidate's knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Body                            Regulated Entity
1.  SEBI                                     :   Chit Fund Companies
2.  RBI                                      :   Housing Finance Companies
3.  Ministry of Corporate Affairs             :   Nidhi Companies
4.  State Governments                         :   Merchant Banker Companies
5.  National Housing Bank                    :   All NBFCs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's examine each pair:

1. **SEBI and Chit Fund Companies:**  Chit fund companies are regulated by State Governments, not SEBI. SEBI regulates entities related to the securities market.

2. **RBI and Housing Finance Companies:** Housing Finance Companies are primarily regulated by the National Housing Bank (NHB), not the RBI. While RBI has some oversight, the NHB is the primary regulator.

3. **Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Nidhi Companies:** This is a correct pairing. Nidhi companies are indeed regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

4. **State Governments and Merchant Banker Companies:** Merchant Banker companies fall under the regulatory purview of SEBI, not State Governments.

5. **National Housing Bank and All NBFCs:** The National Housing Bank primarily regulates Housing Finance Companies, a subset of NBFCs. It doesn't regulate all NBFCs.


Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. This question tests factual recall of regulatory bodies and the entities they oversee within the Indian financial system.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's precise understanding of regulatory frameworks.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Definition/Description
1.  Green Shoots                             :   Signs of economic decline in a sector
2.  PCA Framework for UCBs                  :   Effective from April 1, 2024
3.  Scale-Based Regulation for NBFCs        :   Based solely on the size of the NBFC
4.  Wilful Defaulter                          :   Outstanding amount below ₹25 lakh
5.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)     :   Published bi-annually

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **Green Shoots:** Green shoots represent signs of economic *recovery* after a downturn, not decline.

2. **PCA Framework for UCBs:** The PCA framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) became effective from April 1, 2025, not 2024.

3. **Scale-Based Regulation for NBFCs:** While size is a factor, scale-based regulation for NBFCs also considers activity and perceived riskiness, not solely size.

4. **Wilful Defaulter:** A wilful defaulter is defined as having an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh *and above*, not below.

5. **Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index):** The FI-Index is published annually in July, not bi-annually.


Because all the pairs are incorrectly matched, the correct answer is (d). This question tests detailed understanding of financial terminology and regulatory frameworks, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge.  The distractors are designed to be plausible but subtly incorrect, demanding careful consideration.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Scheme                         Key Feature
1.  SHG-Bank Linkage Program               :   Initiated by RBI in 1992
2.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)     :   Loans exclusively for corporate entities
3.  National Technical Textiles Mission     :   Aims to make India the second-largest market for technical textiles
4.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan      :   Uses closed-source technology
5.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)   :   Targets ₹10 lakh crore over four years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **SHG-Bank Linkage Program:**  The SHG-Bank Linkage Program was initiated by NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development), not RBI, in 1992.

2. **Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY):** PMMY provides loans to *non-corporate*, non-farm small/micro enterprises. The statement in the pair is incorrect.

3. **National Technical Textiles Mission:** The mission aims to position India as a *global leader*, not the second-largest market, in technical textiles.

4. **PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:** The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is built on *open-source* technology, not closed-source.

5. **National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):** The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹10 lakh crore, over four years.

Since all pairs are mismatched, the correct option is (d). This question tests knowledge of various government schemes and initiatives, requiring precise recall of details. The distractors are designed to be plausible alternatives, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Scheme                       Feature/Characteristic
1. Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank : Established in 1984
2. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)      : Loan limit enhanced to ₹30 lakh in 2024 budget
3. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) : Registered as a Type I NBFC-ND


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** SEWA Bank's establishment year is incorrect.  SEWA Bank, India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI), was established in 1974, not 1984. This is a crucial detail that highlights the historical significance of the institution within the Indian microfinance landscape.  The incorrect year serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's factual recall.

* **Pair 2:** The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loan limit was indeed enhanced in the 2024 Union Budget. However, the increase was to ₹20 lakh for those who had successfully repaid loans under the Tarun category, creating a "Tarun Plus" category, not ₹30 lakh. This slight alteration in the figure serves as a subtle yet effective distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail and ability to differentiate between closely related figures.

* **Pair 3:** The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) is correctly identified as registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, a key aspect distinguishing them from Type I NBFC-NDs.  This correct pairing underscores the candidate's understanding of the regulatory framework governing UCBs in India.


The other options are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched Pair 1.  The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of key institutions and schemes in the Indian microfinance sector, their characteristics, and their regulatory environments, demanding both factual recall and analytical skills.



**2. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following pairs:**

   Parameter                                     Characteristic
1.  Exit from PCA                               :  Breaches in risk thresholds observed in four successive quarterly financial statements
2.  Key areas for monitoring                    :  Capital, Asset Quality, and Liabilities
3.  Application of PCA framework                :  All UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Let's break down each pair:

* **Pair 1:** This statement is incorrect.  To exit PCA, no breaches in risk thresholds should be observed for four successive quarterly financial statements. The phrasing in the question subtly inverts the condition, acting as a distractor.  A candidate needs a precise understanding of the PCA exit criteria to avoid this trap.

* **Pair 2:** This pairing is correct. The PCA framework for UCBs correctly focuses on Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability as key monitoring areas.  The inclusion of "Liabilities" in option (b) is a deliberate distractor, designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the framework's focus.

* **Pair 3:** This pairing is also correct. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs in tiers 2, 3, and 4, excluding those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  This correct pairing assesses the candidate's understanding of the scope and application of the PCA framework.


Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched Pair 1. This question effectively tests the candidate's understanding of the PCA framework's application, monitoring parameters, and exit conditions, demanding both factual recall and analytical skills.



**3. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following pairs:**

   Guarantee Type                                 Description
1. Credit guarantees                              : Provided exclusively to the public sector
2. Trade finance guarantees                     :  Provided only for short-term financing needs
3. Political risk insurance                       : Protects against non-commercial risks in public-private partnerships


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) because only Pair 3 is correctly matched.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** This statement is incorrect. While WBG credit guarantees are provided to the public sector, they are also provided to the private sector.  The restrictive nature of the statement in the question acts as a distractor, requiring the candidate to have a precise understanding of the scope of the guarantee.

* **Pair 2:** This statement is also incorrect. Trade finance guarantees are not limited to short-term financing; they can cover various durations depending on the specific needs of the transaction.  This incorrect statement serves as another distractor, testing the candidate's in-depth knowledge of trade finance mechanisms.

* **Pair 3:** This pairing is correct. Political risk insurance offered by the WBG-GP indeed protects against non-commercial risks in private sector projects and public-private partnerships.  This correct pairing assesses the candidate's understanding of the risk mitigation aspects of the WBG-GP.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  This question efficiently tests the candidate's understanding of the different types of guarantees offered by the WBG-GP, highlighting the nuances and subtleties of each type.  The question demands detailed knowledge and analytical skills.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Initiative                            Description/Feature
1.  National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) : Focuses on controlling Brucellosis but not Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
2.  Rashtriya Gokul Mission                      : Aims at improving productivity of indigenous bovine breeds
3.  Pandemic Fund Project                       : Implemented solely by the World Bank


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only Pair 2 is correctly matched. Let's examine each pair:

* **Pair 1:** This statement is incorrect. The NADCP explicitly aims to control and eradicate *both* FMD and Brucellosis.  The exclusion of FMD in the question's statement is a deliberate attempt to mislead the candidate, requiring a precise understanding of the program's objectives.

* **Pair 2:** This pairing is correct. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission accurately focuses on the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds and improving their productivity.  This correct pairing assesses the candidate's knowledge of livestock development initiatives in India.

* **Pair 3:** This statement is incorrect. While the World Bank is an implementing entity of the Pandemic Fund Project, it is not the sole implementing entity.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are also involved.  This incorrect statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's awareness of the project's multi-agency implementation structure.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs. This question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of livestock sector initiatives in India, demanding both factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in descriptions.


**5. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                        Characteristic
1.  NAFIS Launch Year                             : 2018-19
2.  Data Collection Method                       :  Primarily through online surveys
3.  Purpose of NAFIS                             : To provide a comprehensive overview of rural livelihoods and financial inclusion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only Pair 3 is correctly matched. Let’s examine each pair:

* **Pair 1:** This is incorrect. NAFIS was launched in 2016-17, not 2018-19.  The incorrect year serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate’s knowledge of the survey's timeline.

* **Pair 2:** This is incorrect. NAFIS uses a multi-pronged approach for data collection, which includes both field surveys and other methods, not solely relying on online surveys.  This incorrect detail acts as a strong distractor, highlighting the importance of understanding the methodology used in large-scale surveys.

* **Pair 3:** This is correct. NAFIS indeed aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the rural population's livelihoods and their level of financial inclusion, encompassing various aspects like loans, insurance, and pensions. This correct pairing assesses the candidate's understanding of the survey's overall goals.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana explicitly aims to boost seaweed production, aligning perfectly with the stated target.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission's focus on indigenous bovine breeds is well-documented. The National Programme for Dairy Development directly addresses milk quality and product enhancement. Finally, the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) is designed to provide financing for post-harvest management and related infrastructure development, making the fourth pair accurate as well.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements within any of these pairings.  The options are designed to test the candidate's comprehensive understanding of various government schemes related to agriculture and allied sectors.  Incorrect options strategically include plausible, yet ultimately wrong, combinations to challenge the candidate's knowledge and analytical abilities.


**2. With reference to agricultural initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. Digital Agriculture Mission                 :   Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW)
2. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)                  :   Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Agriculture Mission and Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) are both initiatives under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW).  Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) are not directly implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, although they are available to livestock and dairy farmers. The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production scheme is not implemented by NITI Aayog; it is a cabinet-approved scheme, but the implementing agency is different.  Option (a) correctly identifies the two pairs with accurate ministry/agency linkages. Options (b), (c), and (d) introduce incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific implementing bodies for each initiative.  This question tests the candidate's ability to connect government schemes with their respective implementing ministries/agencies, a crucial aspect of understanding policy implementation in India.

   Agricultural Data Platform                   Key Feature
1. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)         :   Farmer identity, geotagged farm location, crops-sown data
2. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) :   Soil Profile Mapping
3.  Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :   Yield Estimation
4.  Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) :   Remote Sensing Data Integration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the first and fourth pairs are correctly matched. ADeX holds the datasets mentioned in pair 1.  DGCES is indeed associated with yield estimates. However, KISAN is primarily focused on crop insurance using space technology, not soil profile mapping; that is a separate component of the Digital Agriculture Mission. While ICCC uses remote sensing data, its primary function is informed decision-making in agriculture, not specifically yield estimation.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise understanding of each platform's functionalities, rather than relying on general knowledge.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to recall specific features of different data platforms used in the agricultural sector and distinguish between closely related concepts.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                        Category
1.  Jute                                       :   Rabi Crop
2.  Masur (Lentil)                              :   Rabi Crop
3.  Groundnut                                  :   Kharif Crop
4.  Safflower                                  :   Commercial Crop


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) Only two
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Masur (Lentil) and Groundnut are correctly categorized. Masur is a Rabi crop, and Groundnut is a Kharif crop. Jute is a commercial crop, not a Rabi crop. Safflower is a Rabi crop, not a commercial crop. The incorrect options include combinations that are partially correct or entirely incorrect, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of crop categories within the Indian agricultural context. The question tests factual recall and the ability to classify crops based on their sowing seasons and economic importance.  The subtle differences between options make simple guessing unlikely.

1.  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Treaty :   Interface between IP, Genetic Resources, and Traditional Knowledge
2.  Geographical Indications Act 1999        :   Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights
3.  Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) :   Prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents
4.  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) :   Legally binding resolution on Indigenous rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WIPO treaty addresses the interaction between intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge. The TKDL aims to prevent biopiracy. However, the Geographical Indications Act 1999 focuses on protecting geographical indications, not plant varieties and farmers' rights (that's a separate act).  UNDRIP is a non-binding declaration, not a legally binding resolution.  The incorrect options test the candidate's understanding of the precise mandates of various organizations and legal instruments related to intellectual property rights and traditional knowledge protection.  The question demands precise knowledge and the ability to distinguish between similar but distinct concepts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                    Focus Area

(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bharatmala Pariyojana is a flagship program focused on the construction of approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases.  This directly matches pair 1.  PM GatiShakti is a national master plan integrating various infrastructure development initiatives to improve logistics efficiency. It aims to create a holistic approach, encompassing railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure, thus making pair 4 correct.

Option (d) is incorrect because Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) primarily aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic, not road freight efficiency. While DFCs contribute to overall logistics efficiency, their core objective is rail-based freight transport. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) is designed to improve the efficiency of freight transport across various modes, but it doesn't specifically focus on the development of Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs), although MMLPs are a component of broader logistics improvement.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana indeed aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, accurately reflecting pair 1. The National Technical Textiles Mission's objective is to establish India as a global leader in this sector, matching pair 2.

Pairs 3 and 4 are incorrect. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme targets the textile industry, but its focus is not primarily on yield estimation using space technology.  KISAN, on the other hand, utilizes space technology for crop insurance and yield improvement, but it is not directly associated with promoting pulses cultivation.  While pulses are included in broader agricultural initiatives, KISAN's core function is risk mitigation through improved yield estimation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Indicator                       Agency/Organization Responsible for Release/Calculation
1. Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)   :   NITI Aayog
2. Logistics Performance Index (LPI)    :   World Bank Group
3. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)  :   Ministry of Commerce & Industry
4.  LEADS Index                           :  Department of Public Enterprises

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is indeed developed and released by the World Bank Group, making pair 2 correct.

The other pairs are incorrect. The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not NITI Aayog. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is calculated by organizations like NITI Aayog (for the national MPI), not the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. The LEADS index measures logistics ease across different states and is not released by the Department of Public Enterprises.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                  Characteristic/Initiative
1. Wheat                                 :   Minimum Support Price (MSP) is fixed annually
2. Pulses                                :   Imports surged to their highest level in six years in fiscal 2024
3. Cardamom                              :   Major producers include Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu (Small Cardamom)
4.  Coconut                              :  MSP is fixed based on MSP of copra

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                        Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)       :   Loans categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun
2. KISAN                                        :    Improvement in yield estimation using space technology
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)         :    Focuses on women's empowerment
4. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre:   Uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) indeed categorizes loans into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun based on loan amounts and repayment capacity.  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) directly leverages space technology and geospatial data for improved yield estimation.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) explicitly utilizes artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for data-driven decision-making in agriculture. Option 3 is incorrect; while the White Revolution 2.0 aims to increase milk procurement and focus on women's empowerment, ADeX is a data exchange platform for farmer services not directly related to this initiative. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Function/Characteristic
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)            :   Develops Eco Mark for environment-friendly products
2. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):  Regulated under the Reserve Bank of India Act
3. Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank:  First Microfinance Institution (MFI) in India
4. Food Corporation of India (FCI)             :   Nodal agency for procuring jute and copra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) does indeed develop the Eco Mark for environmentally friendly products. The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank is correctly identified as India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI).  However, NUCFDC is registered with RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), not regulated under the RBI Act itself. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal agency for procuring wheat and paddy, not jute and copra.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                         Definition/Characteristic
1.  Fiscal Deficit                               :   Excess of revenue receipts over revenue expenditure
2.  Cobweb Phenomenon                          :   Cyclical price fluctuations in certain goods
3.  Green Shoots                                 :    Signs of economic growth after a downturn
4.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)                :   Incentivizes loans to districts with high credit flow

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The cobweb phenomenon accurately describes cyclical price fluctuations in goods due to supply and demand imbalances.  Green shoots correctly refer to early signs of economic recovery following a period of decline.  However, a fiscal deficit is the excess of total budget expenditure over total budget receipts, including borrowings, not the excess of revenue receipts over revenue expenditure. Priority sector lending (PSL) aims to incentivize credit flow to underdeveloped areas and vulnerable sections, not districts with high loan availability. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop/Commodity                             Characteristic/Policy
1.  Wheat                                      :   MSP is decided by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices
2.  Jute                                       :   Jute I-CARE project aims at mechanization in jute farming
3.  Rice                                       :   India is the world’s largest producer of rice
4.  Milk                                       :    Operation Flood significantly increased milk production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for wheat is indeed determined by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. The Jute I-CARE project focuses on mechanization and improved retting techniques in jute cultivation. Operation Flood played a crucial role in boosting milk production in India.  However, China is the largest producer of rice globally, not India. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Act                                   Regulatory Function/Coverage
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     :   Regulates Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)
2.  Banking Regulation Act, 1949                   :   Covers Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):   Operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs
4.  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021 :  Redresses customer complaints related to Housing Finance Companies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for MFIs in India. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, covers Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above as part of the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS). NUCFDC operates as an SRO for UCBs. However, RB-IOS does not cover Housing Finance Companies. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Implementing Agency/Body
1. Project for computerization in PACS           :   Ministry of Cooperation
2. National Cooperative Database (NCD)        :   NABARD
3. Centrally sponsored project for computerisation of PACS :  State Registrar of Cooperative Societies
4. National rollout of Vessel Communication and Support system (VCS) : ISRO

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The government aims to computerize 63,000 functional PACS under a centrally sponsored project.  While the Ministry of Cooperation plays a significant role in the cooperative sector, the direct implementation of the computerization project involves various agencies at the state level. The National Cooperative Database (NCD) is indeed inaugurated by the Ministry of Cooperation, providing information about the cooperative sector.  NABARD's role is primarily in refinancing PACS through DCCBs and SCBs, not in the direct computerization initiative. The National rollout of the Vessel Communication and Support System (VCS) is an indigenous technology developed by ISRO, directly linked to the fisheries sector and not PACS modernization. Therefore, only pair 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                    Key Feature/Objective
1. Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987           :   Mechanization in jute farming
2. Jute I-CARE Project                          :   Compulsory use of jute packaging material
3.  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) : Measures Financial Inclusion through NAFINDEX
4.  Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020 : Gives RBI powers to supersede boards of Cooperative banks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the compulsory use of jute packaging material, not mechanization in jute farming. The Jute I-CARE project focuses on mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting, not on compulsory use of jute packaging material. The NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) uses NAFINDEX to measure financial inclusion. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, significantly enhances RBI's powers over cooperative banks, including the ability to supersede their boards.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cooperative Institution                            Function/Characteristic
1. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS)   :   Regulated by RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs)  :   Provide funds to PACS
3. State Cooperative Banks (SCBs)                :   Not connected to Core Banking Software (CBS)
4. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)              :   Subject to dual regulation by RBI and State/Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PACS are not regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; they are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act. DCCBs indeed play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS. SCBs are connected to Core Banking Software (CBS). UCBs are indeed under dual regulation by RBI and State/Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Scheme                       Characteristic/Objective
1. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) :  Type I NBFC-ND
2.  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)           :   Provides loans with 3% interest subvention up to ₹10 Crores
3.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework     :   Applies to all UCBs including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID)
4.  Priority Sector Lending (PSL)                  :   Formalized in 1972 to ensure credit access to vulnerable sections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NUCFDC is a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  AIF provides loans with a 3% interest subvention, but the maximum loan amount is ₹2 Crores, not ₹10 Crores. The PCA framework does not apply to UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). Priority Sector Lending (PSL) was indeed formalized in 1972 to ensure credit access to vulnerable sections. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Concept                                  Description/Function
1.  Windfall Tax                                   :   Taxes profits from unprecedented events like energy price rise due to firm's active investment strategy
2.  Household Savings Rate                        :   Ratio of household savings to per capita income
3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)                    :   Measures changes in the cost of a basket of goods and services over time
4.  Fiscal Deficit                                 :   Excess of total budget expenditure over total budget receipts including borrowings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Windfall tax targets profits from external events, not from a firm's active investment strategies. The household savings rate is expressed as a ratio of household savings to GDP, not per capita income. CPI accurately measures changes in the cost of a basket of goods and services over time. Fiscal deficit is the excess of total budget expenditure over total budget receipts excluding borrowings.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                      Ministry/Organization Primarily Involved
1. PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks (PM MITRA) Scheme : Ministry of Commerce and Industry
2. Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme : Ministry of Textiles
3. National Technical Textiles Mission : Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
4. Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP) : Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM MITRA scheme falls under the purview of the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  The Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme is indeed a credit-linked subsidy scheme under the Ministry of Textiles aimed at modernizing the textile industry. The National Technical Textiles Mission is a flagship program driven by the Ministry of Textiles, to promote the technical textiles sector in India. The Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP) is also under the Ministry of Textiles, focusing on infrastructure development for textile parks. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because PM MITRA and the National Technical Textiles Mission are under the Ministry of Textiles. Option (b) is incorrect as statement 1 is mismatched. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 and 3 are mismatched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Core Industry                       Weight in Index of Core Industries (ICI) (Approximate)
1. Petroleum Refinery Products          : 15%
2. Electricity                          : 20%
3. Steel                               : 10%
4. Cement                              : 5%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The weight of Petroleum Refinery Products in the ICI is approximately 28%, not 15%. Electricity's weight is approximately 19.85%, close to 20%, making it a plausible distractor. Steel's weight is around 8%, and Cement's is around 5.5%, making these options incorrect. Therefore, only the weight of Electricity is approximately correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate weights assigned to Petroleum Refinery Products, Steel, and Cement. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the composition of the Index of Core Industries.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Primary Function/Area of Operation
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)      :  Regulation of Hallmark and Eco Mark
2. Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) :  Power Generation
3. Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) : Solar Panel Manufacturing
4.  Food Corporation of India (FCI)     : Procurement and Distribution of Wheat and Paddy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The BIS is indeed responsible for the regulation of Hallmark and Eco Mark, certifying product quality and safety. IREDA is a Non-Banking Financial Institution primarily involved in financing renewable energy projects, not power generation itself. SECI focuses on facilitating the procurement and distribution of solar power, not manufacturing solar panels.  FCI is the nodal agency for procurement and distribution of wheat and paddy.  Therefore, only the functions of BIS and FCI are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary functions of IREDA and SECI.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government organizations and their roles in the Indian economy.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Export Scheme              Primary Objective
1. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) : Promotion of Organic Exports
2. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme : Focus on specific products and countries
3. Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme : Assistance for domestic transportation only
4. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana : Seaweed Production Target

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

TIES focuses on improving infrastructure for export, not specifically organic exports. The MAI scheme does indeed target specific products and countries for export promotion. The TMA scheme assists with international freight and marketing, not just domestic transportation.  PM Matsya Sampada Yojana includes a target for seaweed production. Therefore, only the objectives of MAI and PM Matsya Sampada Yojana are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched objectives of TIES and TMA. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of Indian agricultural export promotion schemes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop/Commodity                        MSP Determination Factor (Primary)
1. Wheat                                  : A2+FL
2. Paddy                                 : C2
3. Pulses                                :  A2+FL
4. Oilseeds                              : C2

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While the exact calculation of MSP involves multiple factors, the primary cost considered for wheat and pulses is A2+FL (Actual production cost plus a fixed percentage).  For Paddy and Oilseeds, C2 (Comprehensive cost) is usually the primary cost considered.  Therefore, only the MSP determination factors for wheat and pulses are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary cost consideration for at least one crop.  This question tests knowledge about the Minimum Support Price calculation methodology.  The use of A2+FL and C2 as distractors necessitates a strong understanding of agricultural economics.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                      Characteristic/Association
1.  RBI Ombudsman (ORBIOs)                 :   Handles complaints related to NBFCs
2.  Credit Information Companies (CICs)     :   Regulated by the CIC Regulation Act, 2005
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Registered as a Type I NBFC-ND

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI Ombudsman offices (ORBIOs) handle complaints related to various financial entities, including Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Credit Information Companies (CICs) are indeed regulated by the CIC Regulation Act, 2005, along with RBI guidelines, making pair 2 correct.  However, NUCFDC is explicitly mentioned as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which aligns with NUCFDC's function.  A Type I NBFC would not have this characteristic. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Option (c) is incorrect because NUCFDC's NBFC type is mismatched. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (a) is incomplete because it omits the correctly matched pair 2.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Body                            Regulated Entity/Function
1.  SEBI                                      :   Regulates Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)
2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Issues accreditation to CRAs as External Credit Assessment Institutions
3.  PFRDA                                     :  Regulates aspects of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

SEBI's primary role includes the regulation of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, making pair 1 correct. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also plays a role in regulating CRAs, specifically by accrediting them as External Credit Assessment Institutions, thus pair 2 is correct.  The passage also mentions that  "certain other regulatory agencies, RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA also regulate certain aspects of CRAs under their respective sectoral jurisdiction," thus pair 3 is correct. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution                      Function/Characteristic
1.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)  :   Required to have a minimum Net Own Fund (NOF) of Rs 200 crore to commence business
2.  ARCs                                    :   Prohibited from raising money by way of deposits
3.  ARCs                                    :   Must maintain a capital adequacy ratio of a minimum of 10% of its total risk-weighted assets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While ARCs are indeed prohibited from raising money through deposits (pair 2 is correct), and are required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio, the minimum NOF (Net Own Fund) required for ARCs to commence business is Rs 300 crore, not Rs 200 crore. The capital adequacy ratio is also 15%, not 10%. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pair 1 and 3 contain incorrect numerical figures.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                          Provision/Feature
1.  Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA), 1956  :   Regulates trading in Derivatives
2.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                     :   InvITs are recognized as borrowers under this act
3.  Companies Act, 2013                    :   SROs can be set up as a not-for-profit company under this act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA), 1956, along with the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, regulates trading in derivatives in India, making pair 1 correct.  The text states that sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002, confirming pair 2.  The Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) specifies that an SRO shall be set up as a not-for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, validating pair 3.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Bank                                 Characteristic/Requirement
1.  Universal Banks                             :   Offer a wide range of financial services, including insurance
2.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs) transitioning to Universal Banks :  Must have a minimum net worth of Rs 500 crore
3.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs) transitioning to Universal Banks :  Must have a satisfactory track record of performance for a minimum of 3 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The description of Universal Banks accurately reflects their broad range of financial services, including insurance, making pair 1 correct.  However, the minimum net worth required for SFBs transitioning to Universal Banks is Rs 1,000 crore, not Rs 500 crore, making pair 2 incorrect.  Similarly, the required satisfactory track record is for a minimum of 5 years, not 3 years, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act                             Feature/Responsibility
1.  GST Council                               :   Decisions require a three-fourths majority of weighted votes
2.  GST Appellate Tribunal                    :   Established under the CGST Act, 2017
3.  Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC):   Responsible for collecting the excise duty before GST

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GST Council's decision-making process indeed requires a three-fourths majority of weighted votes, making pair 1 correct. The GST Appellate Tribunal is established under the Central GST (CGST) Act, 2017, confirming pair 2.  Before the implementation of GST, the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) was responsible for collecting excise duty, making pair 3 also correct. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.

Index                                        Specific Feature
1. Gender Inequality Index (GII)             : Measures gender inequalities in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market.
2. Gender Development Index (GDI)            : Measures disparities on the Human Development Index (HDI) by gender.
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI): Adjusts the HDI for planetary pressures.
4. Planetary pressures-adjusted HDI         :  Reflects concern for intergenerational inequality.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is the correct answer.  The GII accurately measures gender inequalities across the three specified dimensions. The GDI correctly measures gender disparities in HDI achievements. The planetary pressures-adjusted HDI indeed reflects concern for intergenerational equity.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The IHDI measures inequality within the HDI, not adjustments for planetary pressures.  That adjustment is made by a separate index.


**7. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following pairs:**

Statement                                      Detail
1. MPI Report 2024                            : Published jointly by UNDP and OPHI.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. Andhra Pradesh is indeed the second-largest contributor to India's silk production after Karnataka.

Statement 1 is incorrect: Karnataka's contribution is around 32%, not 25%. Statement 3 is incorrect: India is the *second* largest silk producer globally. Statement 4 is incorrect: India produces all four varieties of silk—Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.


**1. With reference to India's steel sector, consider the following pairs:**

    **Challenge**                                      **Specific Detail**
    1. Raw Material Deficiency                    :   India heavily relies on costly Australian coking coal imports.
    2. Low Per Capita Steel Consumption          :    India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 was lower than the global average.
    3. Energy Intensity and Carbon Tax Impact  :   India's steel exports to the European Union face threats due to carbon taxes.
    4. Cyclical Demand and Capital Needs       :   Steel demand fluctuates, creating challenges for capital investment.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Indian steel sector faces a multitude of challenges.  Firstly, a significant portion of its coking coal requirements are met through imports from Australia, leading to higher costs and vulnerability to global price fluctuations. This directly reflects the "Raw Material Deficiency" challenge. Secondly, India's per capita steel consumption is considerably lower than the global average and even more drastically lower than that of China, indicating a substantial untapped market potential but also highlighting the challenge of increasing per capita consumption. The "Energy Intensity and Carbon Tax Impact" pair is correct because the steel industry is a significant carbon emitter globally, and India's major iron and steel exports are threatened by the imposition of carbon taxes by the European Union. Finally, the steel industry is known for its cyclical demand patterns, meaning periods of high demand are followed by periods of low demand.  This cyclical nature makes securing sufficient capital for investment and maintaining production stability difficult, accurately reflecting the "Cyclical Demand and Capital Needs" challenge.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**2. With reference to deep-sea mining in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Mineral Type**                                 **Characteristic Feature**
    1. Polymetallic Nodules                         :   Found on seamounts and underwater mountains.
    2. Seafloor Massive Sulphides                   :   Contain copper, gold, silver, and zinc.
    3. Cobalt-rich Ferromanganese Crusts            :   Potato-shaped lumps containing manganese and iron.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Seafloor massive sulphides are indeed deposits of metal sulphides formed around hydrothermal vents, rich in valuable minerals such as copper, gold, silver, and zinc.  Pair 1 is incorrect because polymetallic nodules are small, potato-shaped lumps found on the seabed, not on seamounts (although they can be found near them).  The description in pair 1 accurately describes cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.  Pair 3 is incorrect as it incorrectly attributes the potato-shaped manganese and iron-rich lumps to cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts; this description accurately describes polymetallic nodules. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to India's seaweed farming, consider the following pairs:**

    **Initiative/Program**                             **Key Feature**

    3. National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) :   Established an expert committee chaired by Dr. V K Saraswat.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana indeed has a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025. Pair 2 is incorrect because the NITI Aayog report focuses on developing a strategy for the seaweed value chain, not on establishing a GIS-based portal (though such a portal might be part of a broader strategy).  The establishment of a GIS-based portal is a separate initiative. Pair 3 is incorrect because the expert committee chaired by Dr. V K Saraswat was constituted by NITI Aayog, not NIOT. NIOT's involvement is in offshore cultivation in the Andaman region. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct option.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    **Initiative/Program**                           **Primary Data Focus**

    2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)          :    Farmer identity, geotagged farm location, crops sown.
    3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre:   Informed decision-making using AI, remote sensing, and GIS.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) indeed focuses on improving yield estimation using space technology and geoinformatics. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform primarily holds datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre uses technologies like artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems for informed decision-making in agriculture. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**5. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following pairs:**

    **Mineral Type**                                 **Location/Feature in India's EEZ**
    1. Polymetallic Ferromanganese Nodules       :   Off the coasts of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
    2. Lime Mud                                    :   Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea.
    3. Heavy Mineral Placers                      :   Inner-shelf and mid-shelf off several states including Odisha.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Heavy mineral placers are indeed found in the inner-shelf and mid-shelf regions off the coasts of several Indian states, including Odisha. Pair 1 is incorrect because polymetallic ferromanganese nodules are found in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not off the coasts of Gujarat and Maharashtra (although other minerals are found there). Pair 2 is incorrect because lime mud is found off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, not in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**6.  With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following pairs:**

    **Initiative/Program**                         **Key Feature/Objective**
    1. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)      :   Construction of 65,000 km of National Highways.
    2. Bharatmala Pariyojana                    :   Planned development of 35 MMLPs.
    3. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)       :   Increase rail freight traffic share to 45% by 2030.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are indeed aimed at increasing the share of rail freight traffic from 27% in 2019 to 45% by 2030 as part of the National Rail Plan 2030. Pair 1 is incorrect because the construction of 65,000 km of National Highways is associated with the Bharatmala Pariyojana, not MMLPs.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the planned development of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) is a separate initiative with its own investment outlay, not directly a feature of Bharatmala Pariyojana although they may complement each other. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.


**7. With reference to India's fisheries and aquaculture sector, consider the following pairs:**

    **Initiative/Program**                       **Technological Approach/Feature**
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                 :   Development of Integrated Aquaparks.
    2. Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS) :   Part of PMMSY, aimed at addressing gaps in fish production.
    3. Biofloc                                  :   Environmentally friendly aquaculture technique.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) does include the development of Integrated Aquaparks as a key component. Biofloc is indeed an environmentally friendly aquaculture technique.  Pair 2 is incorrect because RAS (Recirculatory Aquaculture System) is an advanced technology used in aquaculture, but it's not directly defined as *part* of PMMSY although it is a technology that could be employed under the umbrella of PMMSY.  PMMSY is a broader scheme encompassing various initiatives. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to India's renewable energy sector, consider the following pairs:**

    **Organization**                                 **Governing Ministry/Status**

    2. SECI                                          :   Under administrative control of Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.
    3. Navratna Status Eligibility                  :   Requires 'excellent' or 'very good' MoU rating for three of the last five years.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. SECI (Solar Energy Corporation of India) is indeed a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). The criteria for Navratna status include obtaining 'excellent' or 'very good' MoU ratings in three of the last five years and achieving a composite score of 60 or above in selected performance indicators. Pair 1 is incorrect because IREDA (Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency) is under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not a CPSE. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following pairs:**

    **Port Type/Initiative**                         **Key Characteristic/Location**
    1. Vadhvan Port                               :   India's first port to introduce Green Ship Incentives.
    2. Mormugao Port Authority                     :   Located near Dahanu town in Palghar district, Maharashtra.
    3. Dry Ports                                   :   Provide connectivity to seaports by rail or road.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Dry ports, also known as inland ports, are inland terminals providing connectivity to seaports via rail or road.  Pair 1 is incorrect because Vadhvan Port is being developed as the 13th major port in India; Mormugao Port is the one that introduced the Green Ship Incentives (Harit Shrey scheme). Pair 2 is incorrect because Vadhvan Port, not Mormugao Port, is located near Dahanu in Maharashtra. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**10. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Crop Category**                             **Number of Crops Covered**
    1. Kharif Crops                               :   6
    2. Rabi Crops                                 :   14
    3. Commercial Crops                           :   2


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The MSP covers 2 commercial crops: jute and copra. Pair 1 is incorrect because the MSP covers 14 Kharif crops, not 6. Pair 2 is incorrect because the MSP covers 6 Rabi crops, not 14. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.



**1. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Key Feature
1. FASAL Project                           :   Uses AI for crop yield prediction
2. KISAN                                   :   Employs geospatial technology for crop insurance
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)      :   Provides real-time weather data to farmers
4. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Integrates remote sensing data for decision-making


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FASAL (Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations) Project leverages space technology, agro-meteorology, and land-based observations to provide early forecasts of crop output.  While it incorporates data analysis, it doesn't primarily rely on AI for yield prediction.  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) indeed uses space technology and geospatial information for improving crop yield estimation and facilitating crop insurance. ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is a platform for farmer services but does not offer real-time weather data directly;  weather data is one of many inputs. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) uses technologies like AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture.  Therefore, options 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Option 1 is incorrect because FASAL doesn't primarily use AI for crop yield prediction; option 3 is incorrect because ADeX's primary function is not providing real-time weather data to farmers.

   Entity/Initiative                        Role/Function
1. Private Investment Unit, Department of Economic Affairs : Oversees all infrastructure projects
2. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee  : Evaluates central sector PPP projects
3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)      : Aims to reduce government debt through asset sales
4. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)       :  Provides funding for public sector projects only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in policy-level matters concerning PPPs, but it doesn't oversee *all* infrastructure projects.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee specifically evaluates central sector PPP projects, making this pair correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, a key objective of asset monetization, which indirectly aids in fiscal management but is not primarily aimed at reducing government debt.  The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) aims to enhance project viability by providing partial funding support but is not restricted to public sector projects; it can support PPP projects as well. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3.  With reference to  India's financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Act                                     Key Characteristic
1.  Geographical Indications Act 1999           :  Protects intellectual property rights related to agricultural products
2.  RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework:  Applies only to scheduled commercial banks
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC):  Functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)
4.  SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999:  Mandates disclosure of rating methodologies by Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects geographical indications, which are essentially signs used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin.  This includes agricultural products, but also other goods. The RBI's PCA framework applies to various types of banks, including UCBs, not just scheduled commercial banks. NUCFDC acts as an SRO for UCBs. The SEBI regulations for CRAs mandate the disclosure of rating criteria and methodologies, default recognition policies, and guidelines for conflict of interest. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to India's digital infrastructure:**

   Initiative/Program                        Key Feature

2. AIF Credit Guarantee Coverage    : Extended to FPOs by NAB Sanrakshan only
3. AIF Eligible Activities            : Includes integrated primary and secondary processing projects

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) offers a 3% per annum interest subvention on loans up to ₹2 Crores, not 2%, making statement 1 incorrect.  While NAB Sanrakshan is *added* to the existing CGTMSE for extending credit guarantee coverage to FPOs, it's not the *sole* provider, rendering statement 2 inaccurate.  Statement 3 is correct; the AIF expansion explicitly includes integrated primary and secondary processing projects as eligible activities. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the AIF scheme’s details.  The distractors play on the close proximity of the incorrect figures to the correct ones (interest subvention rate) and on the partial truth of the second statement, making the question challenging.


**2. With reference to India's initiatives in Agritech, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative**                                       **Primary Focus**

3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) Platform     : Providing weather forecasts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

FASAL (Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations) primarily focuses on providing early forecasts of crop output, not real-time monitoring, making statement 1 partially incorrect. The KISAN initiative indeed uses space technology for crop insurance improvement, making statement 2 accurate. ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is a platform for farmer services and data exchange including crop-sown data, not weather forecasts, thus statement 3 is incorrect. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding initiatives.  The inclusion of a partially correct statement (FASAL) and a completely wrong statement (ADeX) increases the difficulty.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Cooperatives did release SOPs for "White Revolution 2.0", making statement 1 correct. National Milk Day, commemorating Dr. Verghese Kurien's birth anniversary, is indeed observed on November 26th, making statement 2 correct. However, the SOPs primarily focus on streamlining dairy operations and improving milk production, not specifically on breed conservation, making statement 3 incorrect. This question assesses knowledge of the "White Revolution 2.0" initiative and its key aspects. The distractor focuses on a plausible but ultimately inaccurate connection between SOPs and breed conservation.


**10. With reference to the  "Krishi Vikas Yojana" (Assume a hypothetical scheme for this question), consider the following pairs:**

3.  Patents Act, 1970                     :  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024, were indeed notified by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT).  However, while the RBI plays a role in regulating Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs), the primary governing body for SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 is SEBI itself.  Similarly, while WIPO's conventions influence the Patents Act, 1970,  the governing body for this act is the Indian government.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.  It is crucial to understand that the regulatory framework for these acts and regulations might involve multiple agencies, but the primary governing body must be accurately identified.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A windfall tax is specifically levied on industries experiencing unexpectedly high profits due to favorable market conditions.  Duty drawback mechanisms aim to offset customs duties paid on imported inputs used in the production of export goods.  The Global Minimum Corporate Tax (GMCT) is a targeted tax initiative aimed at multinational enterprises (MNEs) to ensure a minimum level of corporate tax globally.  Therefore, all three pairs correctly describe the characteristics of the respective tax types.  Option (d) is the correct answer because it includes all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership specifically designed to help Least Developed Countries (LDCs) leverage trade as a driver of economic growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  This aligns perfectly with statement 1. Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative spearheaded by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, focuses on creating a seamless system for instant cross-border retail payments by connecting various domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS).  This makes statement 2 correct.  The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is a global effort involving numerous countries to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs). A key component of this framework is the implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, thus validating statement 3. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Economic Policy/Initiative             Description/Feature
1. Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                 :   Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
2. Duty Drawback                              :   Rebates customs duty on imported materials used in export goods
3. Windfall Tax                               :   Tax imposed on industries with significantly high profits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, directly replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) as the funding mechanism for telecom schemes in underserved areas.  The Duty Drawback scheme, as per the Customs Act, 1962, provides rebates on customs duties paid on imported or excisable materials utilized in the production of export goods. Windfall tax is a levy imposed by governments on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favorable market conditions. All three descriptions accurately reflect the respective Indian economic policies or initiatives. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Organization           Characteristic/Function
1. International Monetary Fund (IMF)          :   Provides financial support to countries facing crises, not for specific projects
2. World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP): Consolidates guarantee products from various WBG institutions
3. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) : Regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IMF's primary function is to provide financial assistance to member countries experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties or economic crises.  Crucially, unlike development banks, the IMF does not provide loans for specific projects. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) was launched to centralize all guarantee products and expertise from different World Bank Group institutions under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), streamlining operations and increasing efficiency.  NaBFID, a specialized financial institution in India, is indeed regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI).  All three pairs accurately reflect the characteristics and functions of the respective institutions. Hence, the correct option is (d).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Index/Ranking                     Feature/Characteristic
1. Global Innovation Index (GII)              :   Ranks countries based on innovation capabilities
2. International Intellectual Property (IP) Index:  Released by the US Chamber of Commerce
3. Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index            :   Replaced the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Innovation Index (GII) is a comprehensive ranking of countries based on their innovation performance, encompassing various factors like institutions, human capital, infrastructure, and knowledge creation. The International Intellectual Property (IP) Index is indeed published annually by the US Chamber of Commerce, assessing the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in different economies. The World Bank's Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index replaced the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings following concerns about data irregularities. All three statements accurately describe the respective indices.  Therefore, the correct option is (d).


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Trade Agreement/Initiative                 Provision/Aspect
1.  TRIPS Agreement                          :   Includes provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions
2.  Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)     :   Supported by the World Bank and WTO
3.  Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS: Aims to update international tax rules

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement, a crucial part of the WTO agreements, incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions, establishing minimum standards for intellectual property protection. The EIF (Enhanced Integrated Framework) receives support from various international organizations, including the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO), to assist LDCs in trade-related development. The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS is a significant international tax agreement aimed at modernizing international tax rules and reducing opportunities for tax avoidance by multinational enterprises.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Characteristic
1. Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)       :   Assists Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in using trade for growth
2. Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                 :   Replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
3. National CoE for AVGC-XR                  :   Established as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013
4. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) : Registered with RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership specifically designed to help Least Developed Countries (LDCs) leverage trade for economic growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, directly replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), inheriting its mandate of funding telecom schemes in underserved areas.  The National CoE for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR) is indeed structured as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013.  Finally, the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is accurately described as an umbrella organization registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), a category that involves accepting public funds and direct customer interaction.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the correct answer.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present in any of the pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Mechanism           Function/Characteristic
1.  International Monetary Fund (IMF)       :   Provides loans for specific infrastructure projects
2.  World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) : Aims to boost WBG annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030
3.  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) :  Are not recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002
4.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs :  Effective from April 1, 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) does indeed aim to significantly increase the World Bank Group's annual guarantee issuance.  The other pairs contain inaccuracies. The IMF does not provide loans for specific projects; instead, it offers financial support to countries facing crises. InvITs are, in fact, recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.  Finally, the PCA framework for UCBs was slated to be effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  Therefore, option (b), which correctly identifies only pair 2, is the appropriate selection. The distractors effectively test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the functions and characteristics of these financial mechanisms.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation/Policy                     Key Feature
1. Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024 : Created the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
2. Geographical Indications Act, 1999       : Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge
3. Companies Act, 2013                      :  Governs the establishment of Nidhi companies
4. Banking Regulation Act, 1949             :  Does not apply to Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Companies Act, 2013, provides the legal framework for the establishment and regulation of Nidhi companies. The other pairs are incorrect.  The Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024, operationalized the DBN, which *replaced* the USOF, not created it. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees *collective*, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, *does* apply to UCBs, although the application and extent of regulation might vary, and a specific PCA framework exists for them. Thus, only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairing.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise understanding of these legal and regulatory instruments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                     Description/Function
1.  World Gold Council (WGC)              :  Established in 1986
2.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) :  Not a Navratna CPSE
3.  Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI) :  Under the administrative control of the Ministry of Power
4.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Does not regulate Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. IREDA is not a Navratna CPSE, although it was granted Navratna status later.  The other pairs are incorrect. The World Gold Council (WGC) was established in 1987, not 1986. SECI is under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not the Ministry of Power.  RBI does not solely regulate CRAs; SEBI also plays a significant regulatory role, along with other sectoral regulators.  Hence, only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairing. The incorrect options function as effective distractors, testing the candidate’s precise knowledge of these entities and their functions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Initiative                         Description/Characteristic
1.  One Future Alliance                      :   Launched by the G20 Italy Presidency
2.  Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)           :   Aimed at accelerating DPI implementation across the Global North
3.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan      :   Does not integrate ISRO satellite imagery
4.  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India :  The Private Investment Unit in the Ministry of Finance is responsible for policy-level matters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance) is indeed responsible for policy matters related to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India.  The other pairs are incorrect. The One Future Alliance was proposed by the G20 *India* Presidency, not the Italy Presidency. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) aims to accelerate DPI implementation in the Global South, not the Global North.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan does, in fact, integrate ISRO satellite imagery. Therefore, only option (d) correctly identifies the single accurate pairing.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of these concepts and initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                         Feature/Characteristic
1. Human Development Index (HDI)           :   Developed by Amartya Sen
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)            :   Measures gender disparities in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) :  Ranks countries based on logistics performance
4. Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index :  Adjusts HDI for environmental sustainability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Inequality Index (GII) accurately measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.  The Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) correctly adjusts the HDI to account for environmental sustainability concerns.  Option (a) is incorrect because the HDI was not developed by Amartya Sen; it was developed by Mahbub ul Haq. While Amartya Sen's work on capabilities significantly influenced the HDI's conceptual framework, he wasn't the direct creator. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because the IHDI doesn't rank countries based on logistics performance; that's the function of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI).  The IHDI measures inequality within a country's HDI, showing the loss in HDI due to inequality.  The inclusion of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) as a distractor highlights the importance of differentiating between various development indices. UPSC often tests the ability to distinguish between closely related concepts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Scheme                            Focus Area
1. KISAN                                      :   Improving yield estimation using space technology
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)         :   Providing multilingual information on ornamental fish
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :  Facilitating various fisheries activities in one place
4. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                 :   Data exchange platform for farmer services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) is correctly paired with its focus on improving yield estimation using space technology.  Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.  ADeX is a data exchange platform for farmers, not a source of multilingual information on ornamental fish. That description relates to the Rangeen Machhli app. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre uses technology for informed decision-making in agriculture, not for facilitating various fisheries activities.  PM Matsya Sampada Yojana is a fisheries scheme, not directly related to farmer data exchange. The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of agricultural initiatives in India.  UPSC questions often demand precise knowledge of government schemes and their specific objectives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                        Category
1. Paddy                                       :   Rabi Crop
2. Wheat                                      :   Kharif Crop
3. Gram                                       :   Commercial Crop
4. Jute                                       :   Rabi Crop
5. Rapeseed/Mustard                           :   Rabi Crop


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jute and Rapeseed/Mustard are correctly classified as Rabi crops.  Paddy is a Kharif crop, not a Rabi crop. Wheat is also a Rabi crop, not a Kharif crop. Gram is a Rabi crop, not a commercial crop (though it can be commercially traded).  The incorrect pairings are strategically designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the Kharif and Rabi cropping seasons in India, a crucial aspect of Indian agriculture.  UPSC frequently assesses knowledge of agricultural practices and terminology.  The inclusion of 'Commercial Crop' as a distractor tests understanding of crop classifications beyond the Kharif/Rabi dichotomy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                     Key Finding/Characteristic
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024 :  India's agricultural exports increased by 8% in 2023-24.
2. World Bank’s ‘Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet’ report:  Identifies a “polycrisis” impacting poverty reduction.
3. NITI Aayog's discussion paper on Multidimensional Poverty :  Focuses on seaweed value chain development.
4. NITI Aayog report on Seaweed Value Chain      :  India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank’s report correctly identifies a "polycrisis" affecting poverty reduction. The NITI Aayog report accurately focuses on seaweed value chain development.  Option (a) is incorrect because the 2024 MPI report showed that India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty, not an increase in agricultural exports. Option (b) is partially correct. Option (d) is incorrect because the NITI Aayog's discussion paper on multidimensional poverty does not focus on seaweed value chain development. This question tests the candidate's ability to connect reports with their key findings and differentiate between various reports and their focus areas. UPSC often tests knowledge of recent reports and their implications for policy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                 Function/Role
1. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)   :   Recommends MSP for crops
2. Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) :   Regulates Chit Fund Companies
3. Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) :   Jointly publishes the Global MPI report
4. Ministry of Corporate Affairs                 :   Releases the Human Development Report (HDR) annually

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) correctly recommends Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for crops.  The other options are incorrect. The UNDP releases the HDR, not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The OPHI, along with the UNDP, jointly publishes the Global MPI report, not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.  The Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates Nidhi Companies, not Chit Fund Companies (Chit Funds are regulated by State Governments). This question tests knowledge of the roles and functions of different organizations in the context of economic development and poverty alleviation. UPSC frequently assesses understanding of the institutional framework of policy implementation.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Concept                                   Description/Definition
1. Variable Repo Rate (VRR)                       :   Absorbs excess liquidity from the banking system
2. Repo Rate                                      :   Rate at which banks borrow from RBI
3. Reverse Repo Rate                              :   Market-determined rate for short-term liquidity
4. Priority Sector Lending (PSL)                   :   Focuses on large loans in economically advantaged districts
5. Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)                  :   Assets that are not generating income for the lender

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Repo Rate is correctly defined as the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI. Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) are accurately described as assets that are not generating income for the lender. The other pairs are mismatched. VRR is used to inject, not absorb, liquidity. The Reverse Repo Rate is not market-determined; it's a fixed rate. Priority Sector Lending (PSL) focuses on small loans in economically disadvantaged districts, not large loans in advantaged ones.  The incorrect pairings are designed to test the candidate's understanding of monetary policy tools and banking concepts. UPSC frequently tests knowledge of financial terms and their application in economic policy.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Industry/Sector                         Policy/Initiative
1.  Logistics Sector                         :   PM Matsya Sampada Yojana
2.  Fisheries Sector                          :   National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022
3.  Agricultural Exports                     :   Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme
4.  Seaweed Farming                          :   Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)
5.  Silk Production                           :   Strategy for the development of Seaweed Value Chain


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme correctly relates to the promotion of agricultural exports. The other pairings are incorrect. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 is associated with the logistics sector, not the fisheries sector. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana relates to the fisheries sector, not the logistics sector. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) supports various export-oriented sectors, not specifically seaweed farming. The "Strategy for the development of Seaweed Value Chain" report is linked to seaweed farming, not silk production.  This question tests the ability to link specific policies and initiatives to their relevant sectors, assessing the candidate's knowledge of government programs across different economic domains.  UPSC often assesses knowledge of government initiatives and their impact on various sectors.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Concept                  Regulation/Feature
1.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)   :   Can accept demand deposits
2.  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC)  :   Insures all bank deposits up to ₹10 lakhs
3.  Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs   :   Applies uniform regulations to all NBFCs regardless of size
4.  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms     :   Act as intermediaries for P2P lending participants
5.  Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)               :   Refer to assets generating consistent income


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platforms correctly function as intermediaries for P2P lending participants.  The other pairs are incorrect. NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits. DICGC insures deposits up to ₹5 lakhs, not ₹10 lakhs. SBR for NBFCs applies differential regulations based on size and risk, not uniform regulations. NPAs refer to assets that are not generating income.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of financial regulations and institutions in India. UPSC frequently assesses understanding of the regulatory framework governing the financial sector.  The inclusion of incorrect information serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's in-depth understanding of the topic.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                  Role/Function
1. IRDAI                                            :   Regulates chit funds
2.  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) :   Aims for ‘Insurance for All’ by 2047
3.  World Bank                                      :   Launched the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings
4.  Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade :  Launched the Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index
5.  NITI Aayog                                       :   Published the 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

IRDAI correctly aims for ‘Insurance for All’ by 2047. The World Bank launched the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade uses indicators from the B-Ready Index in their rankings.  The other pairings are incorrect. IRDAI does not regulate chit funds; that's the role of state governments.  NITI Aayog did not publish the Global MPI; it was jointly published by UNDP and OPHI.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of regulatory bodies and their functions, as well as the sources of various economic indices and reports.  UPSC frequently tests knowledge of national and international organizations and their roles in economic development.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                 Key Feature/Focus
1. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)           :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25)
2. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)             :   Provides up to 20% of project costs as a capital grant
3. India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) : Aims to enhance project viability through loans
4. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) :  Targets 1 million ton seaweed production per year by 2025

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25). This makes pair 1 correct.  The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 40% of project costs as a capital grant to enhance project viability, not 20% as stated in option 2, making pair 2 incorrect. The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) aids the development of quality PPP projects by providing funding support, but the description in the pair is too general and doesn't accurately reflect its core function; therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) includes a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.

3.  Food Corporation of India (FCI)                 :  States can purchase rice from FCI under OMSS Domestic
4.  Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA): Established e-NWRs (Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution                  Regulatory Body
1.  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)     :   Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
2.  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)     :   Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) :  Ministry of Finance
4.  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and plays a crucial role in monitoring their capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.  The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), notified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Finance.  Option 1 is incorrect because MFIs in India are primarily regulated by the RBI, not SEBI.  SEBI regulates the securities market. Option 4 is incorrect; while DCCBs which fund PACS are regulated by RBI, PACS themselves are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. They are not directly under RBI's purview.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to financial instruments and facilities, consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Instrument/Facility          Governing Act
1.  Special Drawing Facility (SDF) Overdraft Facility  :  Companies Act, 2013
2.  Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF)               :   Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934
3.  Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF)               :   Indian Contract Act, 1872
4.  Auction Treasury Bills (ATBs)                 :   Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Special Drawing Facility (SDF) Overdraft Facility and other instruments like Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) and Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF), and Auction Treasury Bills (ATBs) are governed by the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.  The Companies Act, 2013, deals with the incorporation and regulation of companies, not these financial instruments. The Indian Contract Act, 1872, deals with contracts, not the specific financial instruments mentioned. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative        Objective
1.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) :  Providing micro-loans to farmers
2.  Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme :  Improving livestock productivity and disease control
3.  Digital Crop Survey under Agri Stack :  Streamlining agricultural services and scheme delivery
4.  Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):  Improving railway safety infrastructure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) aims to provide loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, not specifically to farmers. The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme focuses on improving livestock productivity and controlling diseases. The Digital Crop Survey, a component of Agri Stack, aims to streamline agricultural services and scheme delivery.  Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) is dedicated to upgrading railway safety infrastructure. Thus, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, while pair 1 is incorrectly matched due to its limited scope description.


**4. With reference to indices and reports, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                       Published By
1.  Container Port Performance Index (CPPI)           :   World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence
2.  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)       :   World Health Organization (WHO)
3.  Human Development Report (HDR)                  :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
4.  Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index :  NITI Aayog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) is jointly published by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report is published jointly by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not WHO. The Human Development Report (HDR) is annually released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index is published by NITI Aayog. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                           Key Feature/Function
1.  Jute Corporation of India (JCI)                 :  Regulating the use of jute packaging materials
2.  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) :  Measuring financial inclusion in urban areas
3.  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS)     :  Grassroots-level arms of short-term cooperative credit structure
4.  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                     :  Funding telecom schemes in urban areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) is a price support agency and implements the Jute I-CARE project, but its primary function isn't regulating the use of jute packaging materials. That is done by the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987.  NABARD's All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) focuses on rural areas, not urban areas. Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) are indeed grassroots-level arms of short-term cooperative credit structures. Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) funds telecom schemes in underserved remote/rural areas, not exclusively urban areas.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                    Key Feature
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                       :   Targets 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025
    2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) : Focuses solely on marine fisheries infrastructure development
    3. Rangeen Machhli app                              : Provides information on ornamental fish species in only two Indian languages
    4. National Fisheries Development Program Portal     :  Operates independently of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because statement 1 accurately reflects the target set by PMMSY for seaweed production. Statement 4 is also correct as the National Fisheries Development Program Portal is indeed created under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana, a sub-scheme under PMMSY.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FIDF aims to create fisheries infrastructure facilities in both marine and inland fisheries sectors, not solely marine. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Rangeen Machhli app provides multilingual information in eight Indian languages, not just two.


**2. With reference to India's agricultural policies and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                                    Key Characteristic
    1. Agricultural Export Policy 2018                  : Set a target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022
    2. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                      : Covers only Kharif crops
    3. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)    : Primarily focuses on domestic infrastructure development
    4. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme           : Employs a product-focus approach, ignoring specific markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correctly matched. The Agricultural Export Policy 2018 did indeed set a target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.  The other statements are incorrect. MSP covers 22 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops, and some commercial crops. TIES assists in setting up and upgrading export-linked infrastructure. The MAI scheme uses a focus product-focus country approach, considering both product and market specifics.


**3. With reference to India's silk production, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                               Contribution to Total Silk Production
    1. Karnataka                                         : Around 12% of total silk production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. West Bengal is a major producer of Eri silk. The other statements are incorrect. Karnataka contributed around 32% of the total silk production, not 12%. Andhra Pradesh is a significant contributor but not the second-largest after Karnataka. While Tamil Nadu produces silk, its major contribution is not specifically Muga silk.


**4. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), consider the following pairs:**

    Institute                                             Key Initiative/Area of Focus
    1. National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA) : Celebrated its 50th anniversary recently
    2. ICAR-Central Institute for Research on Cotton Technology (CIRCOT) : Primarily focused on jute research

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. ICAR-IIWBR is involved in the development of KISAN technology for crop insurance using space technology and geoinformatics.  The other statements are incorrect. NISA celebrated its 100th anniversary. CIRCOT focuses on cotton technology, not jute. While ICAR is involved in aquaculture research, NRCPB's primary focus is not specifically biofloc technology.


**5. With reference to India's initiatives in seaweed farming, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                                 Role/Contribution
    1. NITI Aayog                                         : Published a report titled "Strategy for the development of the Seaweed Value Chain"
    2. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                           : Primarily focuses on promoting offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region
    3. National Institute of Ocean Technology- Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI) :  Developed a GIS-based portal for mapping seaweed cultivation sites.
    4.  Dr. V K Saraswat                                   : Chaired an expert committee reviewing the draft policy on seaweed value chain development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. NITI Aayog published the report on the seaweed value chain. PMMSY has a target for seaweed production, although it isn't solely focused on offshore cultivation in the Andamans. NIOT-ACOSTI initiated offshore cultivation and the development of a GIS-based portal. Dr. V K Saraswat chaired the expert committee.  Therefore, all statements are accurate.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Scheme/Initiative                                    Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) : Promotion of ornamental fish species in eight Indian languages
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) :  Establishment of Integrated Aquaparks
3. Rangeen Machhli app                              :  Addressing critical gaps in fish production and productivity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is a comprehensive scheme aiming to boost fish production and address various gaps in the fisheries sector, including infrastructure, technology, and value chain strengthening.  It does not focus specifically on ornamental fish promotion. That is the function of the Rangeen Machhli app.  The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) is designed to create infrastructure facilities for both marine and inland fisheries, which includes the development of Integrated Aquaparks. The Rangeen Machhli app provides multilingual information on popular ornamental fish species, aligning it with its stated purpose. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Aquaculture Technology                        Description
1. Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS)    :  Involves in-situ microorganism production

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) are advanced technologies that recycle and reuse water in fish culture tanks after removing suspended particles and metabolites. Biofloc is an environmentally friendly technique based on in-situ microorganism production for aquaculture. Integrated Aquaparks are designed to bring together various fisheries activities in a single location.  Only the description of Integrated Aquaparks is correctly matched.  The descriptions of RAS and Biofloc are switched in the other pairs, making options (a), (c), and (d) incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                     Activity/Initiative
1. NITI Aayog                                    :   Celebrated its platinum jubilee recently
2. Central Silk Board                             : Published a report on seaweed value chain development
3. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) :  Celebrated 100 years of establishment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NITI Aayog did not celebrate a platinum jubilee in the given context. The Central Silk Board did not publish a report on seaweed value chain development; that was done by NITI Aayog. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA) did celebrate 100 years of its establishment. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link organizations with activities they did not undertake.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Mineral Resource                                 Location/Feature
1. Lime mud                                      :   Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea
2. Polymetallic Ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules : Off Gujarat & Maharashtra coasts
3. Phosphorite                                   : Eastern & Western continental margins

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lime mud is found off Gujarat & Maharashtra coasts and other coastal areas, not in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea. Polymetallic Ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules are found in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not off Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts. Phosphorite deposits are located in the Eastern and Western continental margins of India.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The locations for lime mud and polymetallic nodules are interchanged in the other pairs, making options (a), (c), and (d) incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Edible Oil/Oilseed                                  Related Initiative/Fact
1. Groundnut                                      :   NMEO-OP aims to expand its cultivation
2. Oil Palm                                       : Production concentrated in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu
3. Mustard and sesame seeds                       :   Yellow Revolution focused on boosting their production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) specifically targets expanding oil palm cultivation, not groundnut.  Groundnut production is concentrated in several states, including Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu, but that is not the focus of NMEO-OP. The Yellow Revolution was indeed a movement to boost the production of mustard and sesame seeds.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly link the edible oils/oilseeds with initiatives or facts.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Agricultural Commodity                     Issue/Challenge
1. Oilseeds                                   :   High per capita consumption
2. Millets                                    :   Yield gap due to labor shortages
3. Steel                                      :  Production highly reliant on coal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Oilseeds do not have high per capita consumption; this is more relevant to steel.  Millets face a yield gap due to labor shortages and other factors. Steel production is indeed highly reliant on coal as a reducing agent.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link agricultural commodities with challenges they don't primarily face.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Government Initiative/Policy                      Focus/Objective
1. Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024 :  Regulates the exploration of coal
2.  Sustainable livestock health and production scheme : Aims to improve yield estimation using space technology
3.  PM-AASHA                                       : Ensures MSP for oilseed farmers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, regulate the exploration of offshore minerals, not coal.  The sustainable livestock health and production scheme focuses on improving livestock health and production, not yield estimation via space technology (that's KISAN). PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan) does ensure that oilseed farmers receive MSP. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Technology/Platform                           Application in Agriculture
1. ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange)           :  Real-time information on crop conditions
2. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :  Streamlines farmer services and scheme delivery
3. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) :  Digital crop survey


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is a platform primarily designed to streamline farmer services and scheme delivery, not providing real-time information on crop conditions. That is a function of the Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC). KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) is involved in digital crop surveys.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (c) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Horticulture Initiative/Scheme                     Feature/Objective
1. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) :  Instant disbursal of subsidies using e-RUPI
2.  CHAMAN (Horticulture Assessment and Management) :  Holistic growth of the horticulture sector
3. SURAKSHA (Cluster Development Programme)          :  Better horticulture assessment via remote sensing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

MIDH (Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture) aims for holistic growth, not instant subsidy disbursal (that's SURAKSHA). CHAMAN (Coordinated Programme on Horticulture Assessment and Management) utilizes remote sensing and GIS for better assessment. SURAKSHA (Cluster Development Programme) facilitates instant subsidy disbursal via e-RUPI. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Index                                      Organization/Individual
1. Human Development Index (HDI)          :   World Bank
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)          :   Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) :   Mahbub ul-Haq
4. Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a core component of the Human Development Report (HDR), published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is also published by UNDP, not the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). OPHI is involved in the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), making pair 2 incorrect. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) was not developed by Mahbub ul-Haq, although he is credited with the creation of the HDI itself.  Pair 3 is therefore incorrect. The Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index is indeed a UNDP initiative, making pair 4 the only correct pairing.  The question tests factual recall of the organizations responsible for various human development indices, highlighting the importance of understanding the sources and methodologies of these key indicators in development economics.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, given the interconnectedness of these indices and the organizations working in the field of human development.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Index/Report                                 Key Finding/Feature
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024 :   India ranks highest in extreme poverty globally.
2. World Bank’s ‘Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet’ report :  Global poverty reduction has accelerated in the last 5 years.
3. NITI Aayog’s discussion paper on Multidimensional Poverty :  Poverty Headcount Ratio increased since 2013-14.
4. World Development Report 2024: The Middle Income :  India is unlikely to fall into the middle-income trap.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report does indeed show India having the largest number of people in extreme poverty.  Thus, pair 1 is correct. The World Bank's report, however, highlights a *stalling* of global poverty reduction and prosperity gap, not acceleration, making pair 2 incorrect.  The NITI Aayog discussion paper shows a *decrease*, not an increase, in the poverty headcount ratio in India since 2013-14. Hence, pair 3 is incorrect.  The World Development Report 2024 explicitly states that various countries, *including* India, are at risk of falling into the middle-income trap. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  The question assesses understanding of key findings from different reports on poverty and development, emphasizing the importance of critical evaluation of data sources and their interpretations.  The distractors are carefully chosen to represent common misconceptions or misinterpretations of these reports.


**3. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

Economic Indicator/Concept                     Description/Characteristic
1. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)       : Primarily driven by public investment since economic liberalization.
2. Net Capital Formation (NCF)                : Excludes depreciation, obsolescence, and accidental damage.
3. Crowding out effect                        : Increased government spending leads to increased private investment.
4. Middle Income Trap                          : Characterized by rapid economic growth followed by stagnation at middle-income levels.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While GFCF is a significant indicator of investment, the text indicates that since economic liberalization, both public and private investment have played a role, although private investment experienced fluctuations. Pair 1 is therefore incorrect. NCF does indeed account for depreciation, obsolescence, and accidental damage to fixed capital, making pair 2 incorrect. The crowding-out effect describes a *reduction* in private investment due to increased government spending, not an increase, making pair 3 incorrect. The description of the middle-income trap accurately reflects the phenomenon where economies stagnate at middle-income levels after a period of rapid growth, making pair 4 the only correct match. The question tests the conceptual understanding of key macroeconomic indicators and concepts, requiring accurate recall of definitions and their implications for economic policy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Agreement                                  Provision/Feature
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999         : Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge.
2. TRIPS Agreement                           :  Does not allow compulsory licensing.
3.  Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement :   Affirms that TRIPS prevents measures to protect public health.
4.  TRIPS Agreement                           : Incorporates provisions from WIPO’s Paris and Berne Conventions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act 1999 guarantees *collective*, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge.  Pair 1 is therefore incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement *does* allow compulsory licensing, a crucial provision for developing countries, making pair 2 incorrect. The Doha Declaration explicitly *affirms* that TRIPS does *not* prevent members from taking measures to protect public health, contradicting pair 3.  The TRIPS Agreement does indeed incorporate provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions, making pair 4 the only correct pairing.  The question assesses knowledge of intellectual property rights agreements and their impact on developing countries, specifically focusing on the nuances of different provisions and their implications.  The distractors leverage common misconceptions about these agreements.


**5. With reference to the Indian insurance sector, consider the following pairs:**

Concept/Institution                            Characteristic/Finding
1.  Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) : Not subject to additional regulatory measures.
2. IRDAI’s ‘Insurance for All’ target           : Aims to achieve universal insurance coverage by 2037.
3. Insurance Penetration in 2021-22          :  Stood at 2.71% of GDP.
4. Insurance Density in 2021-22              : Stood at $11.5.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

D-SIIs are indeed subject to additional regulatory measures due to their systemic importance, making pair 1 incorrect. IRDAI aims for universal insurance coverage by 2047, not 2037, thus pair 2 is incorrect.  Insurance penetration in 2021-22 was 4.2%, not 2.71%, making pair 3 incorrect. Insurance density in 2021-22 was $91, not $11.5, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests knowledge about the regulatory framework and key performance indicators of the Indian insurance sector, highlighting the importance of understanding the specific details of these metrics.  The distractors are deliberately set to be close to the correct figures, increasing the difficulty level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership solely focused on helping Least Developed Countries (LDCs) leverage trade to drive economic growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  This aligns perfectly with statement 1.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, directly succeeded the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was created under the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. This makes statement 2 correct. Finally, the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR) is structured as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013, validating statement 3. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The definition of a microfinance loan as provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) accurately reflects statement 1.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) scheme, as updated in the 2024 Union Budget, indeed offers loans up to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) to eligible small and micro enterprises, confirming statement 2.  The Malegam Committee report of 2010, commissioned by the RBI, focused on creating a regulatory structure for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating in the microfinance sector, thus making statement 3 accurate.  Consequently, all three pairs are correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.

3. National Food Security Mission-OS&OP : Focuses on Seed components (breeding, distribution), Production inputs & Technology transfer



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Geographical Indications Act of 1999 aims to protect the intellectual property rights associated with specific geographical regions and their products, thereby guaranteeing collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with those products.

4. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan      :   Utilizes only data from the Survey of India.
5. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)   :   Aims to generate investment by monetising government assets targeting ₹10 lakh crore over four years.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. SURAKSHA, a component of the National Horticulture Board's Cluster Development Programme, indeed leverages e-RUPI vouchers for the swift disbursement of subsidies to farmers.  Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings. The Digital Agriculture Mission utilizes various technologies beyond drones, including remote monitoring solutions and web-based data platforms. KVKs are 100% centrally funded, not by state governments. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan integrates data from multiple sources, including ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps. Finally, the NMP's target is ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹10 lakh crore.  The other options present misleading information, demonstrating a need for precise knowledge of these schemes and their functionalities.  A comprehensive understanding of the nuances of each initiative is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative/Policy          Characteristic
1. Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) :   Provides short-term debt financing for agricultural projects.
2. India’s Agricultural Export Policy 2018:   Successfully achieved its target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.
3. Minimum Support Price (MSP)          :   Covers only Kharif crops.
4. Rashtriya Gokul Mission              :   Focuses on the development of foreign bovine breeds.
5. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana             :   Aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The AIF provides medium-to-long-term debt financing, not short-term as stated in option 1. The India's Agricultural Export Policy 2018 fell short of its export target, making option 2 incorrect. MSP covers both Kharif and Rabi crops, along with some commercial crops; hence, option 3 is false. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on indigenous, not foreign, bovine breeds; option 4 is incorrect.  Option 5 is correct; the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana indeed aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various agricultural initiatives and their specific goals and characteristics, highlighting the need for detailed understanding beyond superficial knowledge.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the depth of understanding.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The NPCI is indeed responsible for the UPI, and BISAG-N did develop the Digital Master Planning tool for PM GatiShakti. The ICAR-NISA focuses on secondary agriculture, not solely primary agriculture (option 1). The Central Silk Board is the second largest silk producer globally, not the largest (option 2). ICAR is not solely responsible for fisheries research, it coordinates across various agricultural sectors (option 5).  The incorrect options highlight the importance of understanding the specific roles and functions of various organizations within the Indian agricultural and financial sectors. The question tests detailed knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding entities and their precise roles.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Policy                            Description/Characteristic
1. Preston Curve                              :   Demonstrates a direct proportional relationship between per capita income and life expectancy at all income levels.
2.  Geographical Indications Act 1999       :   Does not guarantee collective rights over traditional knowledge.
3.  Extractive Institutions                   :   Promote long-term investment and economic growth.
4.  One Future Alliance                       :   Aims to hinder the development of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in developing countries.
5.  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge :   Is only supported by developing nations and not developed nations.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Preston Curve shows that the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy flattens beyond a certain point (option 1). The Geographical Indications Act 1999 *does* guarantee collective rights over traditional knowledge (option 2). Extractive institutions hinder investment and growth (option 3). The One Future Alliance aims to *support* the development of DPI in developing countries (option 4).  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge has been adopted by a wide range of countries, including both developed and developing nations (option 5). This question tests the candidate's understanding of economic concepts, international treaties, and the impact of institutions on economic development. The incorrect options serve as strong distractors, requiring a thorough understanding of the concepts.


**1. With reference to India's infrastructure development initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature
    1. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)      :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25)
    2. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)        :   Provides up to 20% of project costs as a capital grant
    3. India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) : Aids development of quality PPP projects
    4. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in PPP sector : Allows up to 50% FDI in equity of SPVs automatically

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) indeed aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).  The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) does support the development of quality Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

However, the Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) typically provides up to 40% of project costs, not 20%, as a capital grant to enhance project viability.  This makes option 2 incorrect.  Furthermore, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the PPP sector allows for up to 100% FDI in the equity of Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) on an automatic basis for most sectors, not 50%, making option 4 incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to these inaccuracies.


**2. With reference to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and its initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Mark/Scheme                             Description

    3. Eco Mark                               :   Labels environmentally friendly products
    4. Quality Control Orders (QCOs)          :   Issued by state governments to mandate ISI marks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ISI Mark is indeed a quality and safety assurance mark developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).  The Hallmark certifies the purity of precious metals, and the Eco Mark designates environmentally friendly products. These three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.

However, Quality Control Orders (QCOs) are issued by the Central Government, not state governments, to make ISI marks mandatory for certain products. This makes pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only options (a) is correct.


**3. With reference to India's agricultural policies and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                  Key Feature

    2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)       :   India's first data exchange platform for farmer services
    3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS for decision-making
    4. Minimum Support Price (MSP)              :   Covers only Kharif crops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation. ADeX is indeed India's first data exchange platform for farmer services.  The Krishi ICCC uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture.  These three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are accurately matched.

However, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme covers not only Kharif crops but also Rabi crops and some commercial crops, making pair 4 incorrect. Thus, only option (a) is the correct answer.


**4. With reference to India’s agricultural exports and related organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Organization                     Key Function/Feature
    1.  Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) : Focuses solely on promoting rice exports
    2.  Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme     :   Employs a product-country approach for market development
    3.  Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme :  Assists with international freight costs only
    4. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) : Oversees GI registration of Indian products abroad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme uses a product-focus country approach to promote agricultural exports, making pair 2 correct. APEDA does indeed handle GI registrations for Indian products internationally, making pair 4 correct.

However, TIES is not limited to rice exports; it supports various export-linked infrastructure projects.  The TMA Scheme assists with both international freight and marketing components. Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect. Only option (a) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**5. With reference to  grain storage and the Food Corporation of India (FCI), consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Organization                      Key Feature
    1. World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector:  Centralized storage facilities at the national level
    2. Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2007: Established WDRA for private sector only
    3.  e-NWRs (Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts):  Managed solely by private entrepreneurs
    4. Food Corporation of India (FCI):  States cannot purchase rice from FCI under OMSS Domestic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector" aims to establish decentralized storage facilities at the PACS level, not centralized national facilities, making pair 1 incorrect. The Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2007, established WDRA to regulate warehousing, involving both public and private sectors, making pair 2 incorrect. e-NWRs are not solely managed by private entrepreneurs; they are used by various stakeholders in the warehousing system, making pair 3 incorrect.  Finally, states *can* purchase rice from FCI under OMSS Domestic, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and their regulation, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body/Aspect                       Feature
    1. State Governments                        : Regulates all types of NBFCs
    2. Ministry of Corporate Affairs              :  Regulates Nidhi Companies
    3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)               :  Does not regulate P2P lending platforms
    4. Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) : Insures NBFC deposits up to Rs. 5 lakh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs does regulate Nidhi Companies, making pair 2 correct.

However, state governments do not regulate all types of NBFCs; the RBI is the primary regulator for most NBFCs, making pair 1 incorrect. The RBI *does* regulate P2P lending platforms, making pair 3 incorrect.  DICGC does not insure NBFC deposits, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only option (a) is correct.


**7. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Initiative                                    Key Feature
    1.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                           :  Facilitates insolvency resolution of individuals only
    2.  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016   :   Handles reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate entities
    3. National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited :  Resolves stressed assets below Rs. 500 crore
    4. PRAVAAH portal                               :  A platform for obtaining regulatory approvals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IBC, 2016, handles the reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate entities, partnerships, and individuals, making pair 2 correct. The PRAVAAH portal is a platform for obtaining various regulatory approvals, making pair 4 correct.

However, the SARFAESI Act, 2002, allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral but is not solely focused on individual insolvency resolution, making pair 1 incorrect.  The National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited targets stressed assets *above* Rs. 500 crore, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only option (a) is correct.


**8. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) and related concepts, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Concept                               Key Feature
    1. Global Innovation Index (GII)              :   Ranks countries solely based on economic output
    2. International Intellectual Property (IP) Index :   Published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
    3. Trade Secrets (TS)                           :   Confidential business information that cannot be legally protected
    4. Economic Espionage (EE)                     :   The deliberate acquisition of confidential information to benefit a foreign state


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Intellectual Property (IP) Index is indeed published by the US Chamber of Commerce, making pair 2 correct. Economic espionage is accurately described as the deliberate acquisition of confidential information to benefit a foreign state, making pair 4 correct.

However, the GII considers various factors beyond economic output, making pair 1 incorrect. Trade secrets *can* be legally protected, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only option (a) correctly matches the pairs.


**9. With reference to  the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Plan                                  Key Feature
    1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) :   Driven by 5 engines of infrastructure development
    2. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Appraisal Committee: Evaluates only state-level PPP projects
    3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):  Aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets
    4. Digital Master Planning tool                 : Developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) correctly aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, making pair 3 accurate.

However, the PM GatiShakti NMP is driven by 7, not 5, engines of infrastructure development, making pair 1 incorrect. The PPP Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state-level projects, making pair 2 incorrect.  The Digital Master Planning tool was developed by BISAG-N, not ISRO, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only option (a) is correct.


**10. With reference to  the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) and related concepts, consider the following pairs:**

    Industry/Concept                                   Key Feature
    1. Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)             :   Comprises 50% of the weight of items in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
    2. Petroleum Refinery Products in ICI              :   Has the lowest weight among the eight core industries
    3. Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry :   Releases the ICI data
    4. Navratna Status                                 : Granted by the Ministry of Finance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, correctly releases the ICI data, making pair 3 accurate.

However, the ICI comprises 40.27%, not 50%, of the weight of items in the IIP, making pair 1 incorrect. Petroleum Refinery Products have the *highest*, not lowest, weight in the ICI, making pair 2 incorrect.  The Department of Public Enterprises, not the Ministry of Finance, grants Navratna status, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only option (a) is correct.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Feature
1. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) :   Receives deposits from, and lends to, its members only
2. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)             :   Develops the Eco Mark for environment-friendly products
3.  National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) : Focuses on Seed components (breeding, distribution)
4. Food Corporation of India                      :   Nodal Central procuring agency for wheat and paddy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  PACS, as cooperative credit institutions, operate on the principle of mutual benefit, serving only their members. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing various quality marks, including the Eco Mark, which signifies environmentally friendly products.  The National Food Security Mission – Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) has a strong focus on seed-related aspects, including breeding and distribution, to improve oilseed production. Lastly, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) serves as the primary central agency for procuring wheat and paddy, playing a crucial role in India's food security system.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative                           Primary Goal
1.  Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) : Aims to expand oil palm cultivation
2.  National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)           :  Ensures oilseed farmers receive MSP
3.  National Jute Development Programme         :   Develops jute cultivation, manufacture, and marketing
4.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)             :  Provides real-time information on crop conditions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The National Jute Development Programme aims to improve the entire jute value chain, from cultivation to marketing.  The other options contain mismatched pairings. PM-AASHA's primary goal is to ensure Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for farmers, not oil palm expansion (that's NMEO-OP's goal). NMEO-OP focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation, not ensuring MSP for oilseed farmers (that is the aim of PM-AASHA). ADeX is a data platform, not a system for providing real-time crop information (that is a feature of the Krishi Decision Support System).  Therefore, only the pairing related to the National Jute Development Programme is accurate.


**3.  With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Crop/Product                                    Significant Characteristic/Feature
1.  Kodo Millet                                     :   Lower phosphorus content than other millets
2.  Sesame                                         :   Remnants discovered at Harappa and Mohenjodaro
3.  Jute                                           :   Fibre loosened through a process called retting
4.  Oilseed cultivation                             :   Majority is rainfed


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Kodo millet is indeed known for having a lower phosphorus content compared to other millets. Archaeological evidence shows sesame seed remnants at Harappa and Mohenjodaro, indicating its ancient cultivation. Jute fiber extraction relies on the retting process. A significant portion of oilseed cultivation in India is rainfed, making it vulnerable to monsoon variability.  Each statement reflects a factual characteristic of the respective crop or agricultural practice.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator/Policy                        Description/Feature
1.  Retail Inflation                               :   Measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
2.  Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC)                    :   A monetary policy tool regulating state government borrowing
3.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)                    :   Covers 22 crops including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi and 2 commercial crops
4.  Logistics Performance Index (LPI)              :   Ranks countries based on trade logistics performance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Retail inflation is accurately measured by the CPI. The MSP system indeed covers the specified number of Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops. The LPI accurately assesses the performance of trade logistics across countries. However, pair 2 is incorrect. The Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC) is a fiscal policy tool, not a monetary policy tool.  Therefore, only three of the four pairs are correct.


**5. With reference to India's industrial sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Industrial Sector/Initiative                      Key Aspect/Feature
1.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)            :   Includes fertilizers, cement, natural gas, crude oil, coal, electricity, steel, and petroleum refinery products.
2.  Navratna Status                               :   Granted to Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA)
3.  National Technical Textiles Mission            :   Aims to make Jute products cost competitive globally.
4.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)           :   Government has planned 35 MMLPs with an investment outlay of $6.2 Billion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The ICI accurately reflects the composition of core industries. IREDA has indeed been granted Navratna status. The planned number and investment outlay for MMLPs are also correct. However, pair 3 is incorrect. The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to boost the technical textiles sector, not specifically make jute products cost-competitive (that's the goal of a different initiative). Therefore, only three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. With reference to the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body                                   Type of NBFC Regulated
    1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     : Housing Finance Companies
    2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)   : Chit Fund Companies
    3. Ministry of Corporate Affairs                   : Nidhi Companies
    4. State Governments                              : Merchant Banker Companies


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the primary regulator for various types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies.  The Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates Nidhi Companies, which are essentially mutual benefit societies.  State governments typically regulate Chit Fund Companies, which operate under state-specific legislation. SEBI, on the other hand, regulates entities involved in securities markets, such as Merchant Bankers and Venture Capital Funds, not Chit Funds. Option (a) is incorrect because while RBI regulates many NBFCs, it doesn't exclusively regulate Housing Finance Companies; other regulatory bodies also play a role. Option (c) is incorrect as State Governments regulate Chit Funds, not Nidhi Companies. Option (d) is incorrect because SEBI does not regulate Chit Funds; that responsibility falls under the purview of State Governments. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the regulatory landscape of NBFCs in India.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the regulatory framework governing different types of NBFCs.


**2. With reference to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                         Description
    1. Establishment Year                              : 1971
    2. Maximum Deposit Insurance Coverage Amount     : ₹5 lakh
    3. Entities Covered                                 : All Commercial Banks in India, Regional Rural Banks
    4. Act under which it was established              : DICGC Act, 1961

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 3 only
    (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The DICGC was established under the DICGC Act, 1961.  The corporation insures all bank deposits up to a maximum amount of ₹5 lakh per depositor per bank.  The entities covered include commercial banks (including foreign bank branches), local area banks, and regional rural banks. However, the year of establishment is incorrectly stated in option (d). The DICGC was actually established in 1961, not 1971. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete as they omit some correctly matched pairs.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched. This question tests factual recall about a crucial financial institution in India and its functions.


**3. With reference to the Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of SBR                                  Description
    1. Basis of Segregation                           : Size, Activity, and Perceived Riskiness
    2. Number of Layers in the Segregation           : Five
    3. Regulatory Requirements                       : Uniform across all layers
    4. Objective                                      : To improve the financial health of NBFCs


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs segregates them into layers based on their size, activity, and perceived risk.  The primary objective of SBR is to enhance the financial health and stability of NBFCs by tailoring regulations to their risk profiles. However, the number of layers is four, not five, and the regulatory requirements are *differential*, not uniform, across the layers. Option (a) is incomplete; it only includes the correct aspect of segregation. Option (c) and (d) include incorrect information regarding the number of layers and the uniformity of regulations. Thus, only pairs 1 and 4 are accurately matched. The question assesses conceptual understanding and the application of knowledge regarding the SBR framework for NBFCs.


**4.  With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of NUCFDC                                 Description
    1. Registration Type                               : Type II NBFC-ND
    2. Primary Function                                : Regulating UCBs
    3. Year of First Recommendation as an Umbrella Organization : 2009
    4.  Capital Raising Target                        : ₹300 crore


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, meaning it accepts public funds and has a customer interface. Its primary function is to provide liquidity and capital support, regulatory compliance assistance, and technological platforms to UCBs, not to regulate them. The need for a UO for India’s UCB sector was first recommended in 2009 by a working group. The NUCFDC aims to raise capital, with a target of ₹300 crore. Option (a) is incomplete. Option (c) incorrectly states the primary function. Option (d) is incorrect because the NUCFDC does not regulate UCBs.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, showcasing the understanding of the NUCFDC's role and characteristics.


**5. With reference to Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of PCA Framework                          Description
    1. Effective Date                                  : April 1, 2025
    2.  Replaced Framework                           : Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)
    3. UCB Categories Covered                        : Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3
    4. Key Monitoring Areas                           : Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PCA framework for UCBs became effective from April 1, 2025, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF). Capital, asset quality, and profitability are the key areas monitored under the PCA framework.  However, the statement regarding UCB categories covered is slightly inaccurate. The PCA framework applies to Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 UCBs, excluding those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID), not Tier 1. Options (b), (c), and (d) either omit correct pairs or include incorrect information.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the PCA framework for UCBs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement                           Key Feature
1. Agreement on Agriculture              :   Introduced the "peace clause" for public stockholding
2. Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies     :   Adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva
3. Marrakesh Agreement                    :   Established the WTO in 1995
4. Nairobi Ministerial Decision 2015    :   Deals with tariffication of non-tariff barriers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Agreement on Agriculture, negotiated during the Uruguay Round and finalized in Marrakesh, does indeed include provisions related to market access, domestic support, and export subsidies. While it didn't explicitly introduce the "peace clause" initially, the Bali Ministerial Conference (MC9) in 2013 introduced a "peace clause" as an interim solution regarding Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security, which is related to the Agreement on Agriculture.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct in the context of its later evolution.

The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies was a significant outcome of the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) held in Geneva in 2022, aiming to curb harmful fishing subsidies.  This makes statement 2 correct.

The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, concluded the Uruguay Round and led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).  Statement 3 is therefore correct.

The Nairobi Ministerial Conference (MC10) in 2015 saw the adoption of a decision on export subsidies, significantly impacting agricultural trade policies.  Therefore, statement 4 is incorrect as it describes Market Access, a feature of the Agreement on Agriculture.


**2. With reference to Public Stockholding (PSH) in the context of the WTO, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Concept                          Position/Characteristic
1. Developed Countries                    :   Advocate for no export restrictions on PSH
2. Developing Countries                   :   Seek a permanent solution for PSH at the WTO
3. De Minimis Limit                       :   Calculated based on the reference price of 1986-88
4. Peace Clause                           :   Permanent solution to the PSH issue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Developed countries have consistently argued that Public Stockholding (PSH) programs distort markets and advocate against export restrictions on these programs, making statement 1 correct.  Developing countries, on the other hand, have persistently pushed for a permanent solution at the WTO to address concerns about their food security programs and the impact of trade rules on their PSH policies, making statement 2 correct.  The de minimis limit, which defines the permissible level of domestic support, is currently calculated using a reference price from 1986-88, making statement 3 correct.  However, the peace clause is an interim, not a permanent, solution, making statement 4 incorrect.


**3. With reference to Indian economic policy, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                  Characteristic/Feature
1.  Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)           :   GST rate on purchases exceeds GST rate on sales
2.  Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax     :   Indexation benefits abolished for properties acquired after July 23, 2024
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)  :   Targets ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22-FY25)
4.  Geographical Indications Act 1999       :   Guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

An Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) arises when import duties on input goods are higher than on finished goods, leading to a situation where the GST paid on purchases exceeds the GST payable on sales. This is accurately described in statement 1.  The amendment to the LTCG tax provisions abolished indexation benefits for properties acquired after July 23, 2024, as stated correctly in statement 2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22-FY25), making statement 3 correct.  The Geographical Indications Act of 1999 indeed guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge, making statement 4 correct.


**4. With reference to financial institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                 Characteristic/Function
1.  National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) :   Regulates Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS)
2.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)   :   Buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks
3.  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS):   Registered under the Cooperative Societies Act
4.  Jute Corporation of India (JCI)           :   Implements the Jute I-CARE project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While NABARD plays a crucial role in rural finance, it does not directly regulate PACS; that responsibility lies with the respective State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  ARCs indeed purchase NPAs from banks to help clean up their balance sheets, making statement 2 correct. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, making statement 3 correct.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) does implement the Jute I-CARE project for improved cultivation and retting, making statement 4 correct.


**5. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                            Description/Feature
1.  Green Shoots                            :   Signs of economic growth after a downturn
2.  FMCG Sector                             :   Characterized by high turnover consumer packaged goods
3.  ISI Mark                                 :   Developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
4.  Co-lending                               :   Arrangement where multiple lenders provide loans jointly


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Green shoots accurately represent early signs of economic recovery after a period of decline, making statement 1 correct.  The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector is indeed characterized by high-turnover consumer packaged goods, making statement 2 correct.  The ISI mark is a certification of quality and safety developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), making statement 3 correct.  Co-lending involves multiple lenders partnering to provide loans, sharing risk and increasing lending capacity, making statement 4 correct.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution                     Key Function/Characteristic
1.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) :  Regulated by the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007
2.  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS)  :  Directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India     : Primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The statement about NUCFDC is incorrect.  While NUCFDC is indeed an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), it is registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), not under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, governs payment systems and settlement systems in India, not the regulation of UCBs or their umbrella organizations.  The statement concerning PACS is also incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  They are *not* directly regulated by the RBI, although DCCBs, which provide funds to PACS, are regulated by the RBI.  The statement about CRAs is correct. In India, Credit Rating Agencies are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), although other regulators like the RBI have some oversight in specific areas.  Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Primary Focus
1.  Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987 :  Mechanization in jute farming
2.  Geographical Indications Act 1999             :  Protection of traditional knowledge associated with specific products
3.  Biological Diversity Act, 2002                :  Price support for jute producers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jute Packaging Materials Act focuses on mandating the use of jute packaging, not on mechanization in jute farming.  The Jute I-CARE project addresses mechanization. The Geographical Indications Act is correctly matched; its primary purpose is to protect the collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical areas and products. The Biological Diversity Act aims for fair and equitable benefit-sharing from the use of biological resources and associated traditional knowledge, not price support for jute producers.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) is the price support agency for jute. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Body                                   Regulated Entity/Area
1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                       :  Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for all regulated entities
2.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)    :  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)
3.  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)                  :  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's role in recognizing SROs is limited to a specific framework, not all regulated entities. SEBI is indeed the primary regulator for InvITs, as outlined in the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 (amended in 2024). BIS sets standards and issues quality control orders, but it does not regulate CRAs; that role primarily belongs to SEBI.  Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India's financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Mechanism/Policy                        Characteristic
1.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework        :  Applies only to UCBs in tier 1 category
2.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)            :  Focuses on privatization of government assets
3.  Windfall Tax                                     :  A tax on industries experiencing below-average profits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PCA framework applies to UCBs in tier 2, 3, and 4 categories, excluding those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID), not only tier 1.  The NMP is correctly matched; it aims to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets. The definition of windfall tax is incorrect; it is levied on industries with *significantly above-average* profits, not below-average profits. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   DPI Component                                   Example
1.  Identity Layer                                 :  DigiLocker
2.  Payment Layer                                  :  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
3.  Data Governance Layer                         :  Aadhaar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DigiLocker is a digital document storage service, related to data governance, not the identity layer which is primarily Aadhaar.  UPI is correctly matched as the example for the payment layer. Aadhaar is correctly matched as an example for the identity layer. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly assign examples to the wrong layers within the India Stack DPI architecture.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                      Key Feature/Objective
1. Bharatmala Pariyojana                     :   Construction of 65,000 km National Highways
2. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)       :   Increase rail freight traffic share to 45% by 2030
3. Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) :   Improve freight transport efficiency through specific projects
4. PM GatiShakti                              :   Driven by seven engines, including railways and logistics
5. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)       :  Planned establishment of 35 parks with a $6.2 billion investment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Bharatmala Pariyojana is a significant infrastructure project aiming to construct a vast network of national highways, as stated in the provided text. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) are explicitly designed to enhance the efficiency of rail freight transport and increase its share in overall freight movement, aligning with the National Rail Plan 2030. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) directly focuses on improving freight transport efficiency. PM GatiShakti is a comprehensive national master plan driven by seven key engines, including railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure, to create a unified approach to infrastructure development. Finally, the government's plan for Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) involves the construction of 35 such parks with a substantial investment outlay.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   IMF Lending Instrument                    Characteristic
1. General Resources Account (GRA)         :   Provides concessional financial support at zero interest rates
2. Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) :   Offers longer-term financing to vulnerable middle-income countries
3. Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) :   IMF members have access on non-concessional terms
4. “Gold Tranche” (Reserve Tranche)       :   Credit system granted by IMF to its members


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides financial support to IMF members on market-based interest rates, not concessional terms as stated in option 1.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) focuses on providing concessional support to low-income countries, not vulnerable middle-income countries as stated in option 2. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) does offer longer-term financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, but this is not the defining characteristic of the PRGT.  The "Gold Tranche" (Reserve Tranche) is accurately described as a credit system granted by the IMF to its members.  Therefore, options 1 and 2 are incorrect due to mismatched characteristics, making (c) the only accurate answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   World Bank Guarantee Type                 Description
1. Credit guarantees                        :   Provided to private lenders for infrastructure projects
2. Trade finance guarantees                 :   Political risk insurance against non-commercial risks
3. Political risk insurance                  :   Cover for loans to the public or private sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Credit guarantees from the World Bank are indeed provided to private lenders for infrastructure projects that require substantial financing and face significant risks.  Political risk insurance covers non-commercial risks for private-sector projects or public-private partnerships.  However, trade finance guarantees are a distinct type of coverage, not a description of political risk insurance as stated in option 2.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings. The other options contain mismatched descriptions of the World Bank's guarantee types.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement/Initiative               Key Feature/Outcome
1. Marrakesh Agreement                     :   Established a modern multilateral trading system
2. Agreement on Agriculture                :   Contains provisions on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies
3. WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):   Aims to curb harmful fisheries subsidies contributing to stock depletion
4.  OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS  :   Focuses on preventing tax avoidance by multinational enterprises


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, established the World Trade Organization (WTO) and a modern multilateral trading system. The Agreement on Agriculture addresses market access, domestic support (subsidies), and export subsidies. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb harmful subsidies that deplete fish stocks. Finally, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is a global initiative to combat tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).  There are no inaccuracies or misleading statements in the provided pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Agricultural Initiative/Policy      Primary Objective/Feature
1. KISAN (Crop Insurance)                   :   Data exchange platform for farmer services
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)       :    Improvement in yield estimation using space technology
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Tech-driven solution for informed decision-making in agriculture
4. Minimum Support Price (MSP)              :   Minimum rate at which farmers sell crops to the government
5. India’s Agricultural Export Policy 2018 :   Set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is incorrectly matched. KISAN is a crop insurance scheme leveraging space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation, not a data exchange platform.  ADeX is correctly described as India's first data exchange platform for farmer services.  The Krishi ICCC utilizes technology for informed decision-making in agriculture. MSP is the minimum price at which the government procures crops from farmers.  India's Agricultural Export Policy 2018 did set a target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.  Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Offshore Mineral Resource                Location/Characteristic
1. Lime mud                                :   Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea
2. Heavy mineral placers                    :   Off Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra coasts
3. Phosphorite                              :   Eastern & Western continental margins
4. Polymetallic Ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts: Within EEZ off Gujarat & Maharashtra coasts
5. Construction grade sand                  :   Inner-shelf and mid-shelf regions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Heavy mineral placers are found off the coasts of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra. Phosphorite deposits exist along India's Eastern and Western continental margins. However, lime mud is found off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, not the Andaman and Lakshadweep Seas as indicated in pair 1. Polymetallic nodules and crusts are located in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts as indicated in pair 4. Construction grade sand is found off the Kerala coast, not in inner-shelf and mid-shelf regions as suggested in pair 5.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Steel Sector Challenge                  Specific Example/Consequence
1. Lack of Raw Material                     :   High logistics costs in steel transportation
2. Low per capita consumption              :   India's per capita finished steel consumption was 97.7 kg in 2023-24
3. Extremely energy-intensive industry     :   India's major iron and steel exports face threats due to EU carbon tax
4. High Logistics Costs                     :   India largely fulfills its coking coal requirements through costly imports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. India's low per capita steel consumption is a stated fact. The energy-intensive nature of steel production leads to challenges with carbon taxes imposed by the EU. High logistics costs are a significant challenge for the steel sector. However, the lack of raw materials is exemplified by India's reliance on costly coking coal imports, not high logistics costs as suggested in pair 1. Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Option (a), (b), and (c) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. Bharatmala Pariyojana                       :   Construction of 65,000 km of National Highways
2. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)          :   Increase rail freight traffic share to 75% by 2030
3. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)         :   Investment outlay of $6.2 Billion
4. Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP): Aims to improve freight transport efficiency by 50%
5. PM GatiShakti                               :   Integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bharatmala Pariyojana indeed aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project aims to significantly increase the share of rail freight traffic, but the target is 45%, not 75%, by 2030. The government's plan for Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) includes an investment outlay of $6.2 billion. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) focuses on improving freight transport efficiency. PM GatiShakti utilizes ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps for integrated planning. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect information regarding the targets and features of various initiatives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Port                                          Characteristic
1. Vadhvan Port                               :   India's largest deep-water port
2. Kolkata Port (Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port) :   India's only major riverine port
3. Mumbai Port                               :   Largest natural harbor in India
4. Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port)               :   Only corporatized port registered as a company

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Vadhvan Port is planned to be one of India's largest deep-water ports and the country's largest container port. Kolkata Port, now renamed Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port, is indeed India's only major riverine port. Mumbai Port holds the distinction of being the largest natural harbor in India.  Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) is uniquely structured as the only corporatized port registered as a company.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Rule                                   Provision
1. Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024 :   Applies to all minerals except mineral oils and hydrocarbons
2. Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957: Defines exploration stages using UNFC and CRIRSCO standards
3. The Major Port Authorities Act, 2021         :   Governs the operation of major ports on a landlord port model


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils and hydrocarbons from their purview. The Major Port Authorities Act, 2021, establishes the landlord port model as the operational framework for major ports in India. However, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, does not itself define exploration stages using UNFC and CRIRSCO standards; this is a feature of the 2024 Offshore Areas Rules. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pair 2.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                         Focus Area
1.  NaBFID (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development) :   Long-term non-recourse infrastructure financing
2.  Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK)      :   Upgrading railway safety infrastructure
3.  World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) : Ranks countries based on trade logistics performance
4.  International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH): Publishes the Environmental Ship Index (ESI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NaBFID's primary objective is to provide long-term non-recourse infrastructure financing. RRSK is dedicated to upgrading critical railway safety infrastructure. The World Bank's LPI indeed ranks countries based on their trade logistics performance.  The IAPH is responsible for publishing the ESI. Consequently, all four pairs are accurately matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Policy                                 Description
1.  Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) :  Facilitates access to logistics facilities at each other’s bases
2.  Landlord Port Model                         :   Private players manage operations, port authority regulates
3.  Harit Shrey Scheme                          :   Incentivizes ships with favorable ESI scores
4.  Dry Port                                    :   Inland terminal providing connectivity to a seaport


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

RELOS allows militaries to access logistics and support facilities. The landlord port model involves private operational management under port authority regulation. The Harit Shrey Scheme incentivizes environmentally friendly shipping practices. Dry ports provide inland connectivity to seaports.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) omit at least one correct pairing.


**1. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Port                                      Characteristic
    1. Kolkata Port                           : Largest natural port in India
    2. Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port)         : Only corporatized port in India
    3. Mumbai Port                           : Only major riverine port in India
    4. Vadhvan Port                          : Country's largest container port (planned)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) is indeed the only major port in India registered as a company, making it a unique case of corporatization within the Indian port system.  Vadhvan Port, as planned, is slated to become the country's largest container port and one of the largest deep-water ports, a significant development in India's port infrastructure.  The other options are incorrect.  Kolkata Port, while historically significant, is not the largest natural port; that distinction belongs to Mumbai Port.  Furthermore, Kolkata Port is the only major riverine port in India, not Mumbai Port.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between characteristics of various Indian ports. The distractors are designed to confuse candidates familiar with the general features of Indian ports but not with the specific details of each port's unique characteristics.


**2. With reference to India's logistics infrastructure, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                   Key Feature
    1. Bharatmala Pariyojana                 : Development of Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)
    2. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)    : Aims to increase rail freight traffic share to 45% by 2030
    3. Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) :  Investment outlay of $6.2 Billion
    4. PM GatiShakti                           : Integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project indeed aims to significantly increase the share of rail freight traffic in India's transportation network.  PM GatiShakti, a comprehensive national master plan, utilizes advanced technologies like ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps for its planning and implementation. Option (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect. Bharatmala Pariyojana is focused on national highway development, not primarily on MMLPs although MMLPs are part of the overall plan.  The $6.2 billion investment outlay is associated with the planned MMLPs under Bharatmala, not LEEP. LEEP focuses on improving freight transport efficiency through various measures. This question tests the candidate's understanding of various Indian government initiatives related to logistics and infrastructure development, requiring both factual recall and the ability to connect initiatives with their key features.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's precise knowledge.



**3. With reference to initiatives related to India's fisheries and aquaculture sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                         Key Feature
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana             :  Development of Integrated Aquaparks
    2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) : Aims for 1 million ton seaweed production per year by 2025
    3. Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS) : Environmentally friendly aquaculture technique based on in-situ microorganism production
    4. Biofloc                               : Uses mechanical and biological filters to recycle water

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is a comprehensive scheme that indeed includes the development of Integrated Aquaparks as a key component to improve fisheries infrastructure and production. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025 is associated with PMMSY, not FIDF.  FIDF aims to create infrastructure for both marine and inland fisheries.  Biofloc is an environmentally friendly aquaculture technique, while RAS involves water recycling using mechanical and biological filters. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of specific government schemes and their features in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. The distractors are designed to test a candidate's detailed knowledge of these schemes and their components.

    4. GIS-based portal                       : Provides real-time performance monitoring dashboard

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog has indeed published a report on the strategy for developing the seaweed value chain in India.  PM Matsya Sampada Yojana is a key initiative promoting seaweed cultivation, including offshore cultivation in the Andaman region.  NIOT-ACOSTI plays a significant role in seaweed cultivation research and development. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. The GIS-based portal is intended to map seaweed cultivation sites, not for real-time performance monitoring.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various organizations and initiatives involved in promoting seaweed farming in India and their specific roles.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the roles of different entities.


**5. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following pairs:**

    Mineral                                   Location/Feature
    1. Lime mud                               :  Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea
    2. Polymetallic Ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts : Off Gujarat & Maharashtra coasts
    3. Heavy mineral placers                   : Inner-shelf and mid-shelf off various coasts
    4. Phosphorite                             : Eastern & Western continental margins

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Heavy mineral placers are found in the inner-shelf and mid-shelf regions off the coasts of several Indian states, aligning with the given description. Phosphorite deposits exist along both the eastern and western continental margins of India.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. Lime mud is found off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, not in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea.  Polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts are predominantly located in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not off Gujarat and Maharashtra.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of various offshore mineral resources in India. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the locations of these resources.


**6. With reference to the Indian financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Initiative                           Feature
    1. India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) : Established at GIFT City, Gandhinagar
    2. Carry Trade                               : Involves borrowing in low-interest currency
    3. National Stock Exchange (NSE)             : Regulates IIBX
    4. IFSC Authority (IFSCA)                   : Regulates IIBX

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX) is indeed established at the GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.  Carry trade is a financial strategy that involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency to invest in higher-yielding assets.  IFSC Authority (IFSCA) is the regulatory body for IIBX. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.  NSE is a promoter of IIBX, not its regulator. This question assesses understanding of key entities and their functions in the Indian financial sector, requiring both factual recall and understanding of financial concepts.  The distractors test understanding of the regulatory framework and the characteristics of different financial instruments.


**7. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Initiative                           Role/Function
    1. Private Investment Unit, Department of Economic Affairs : Evaluates central sector PPP projects
    2. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee : Responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs
    3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)    : Seeks to generate investment by monetising government assets
    4. World Bank                               : Released Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report on PPPs

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, a key aspect of PPP initiatives.  The World Bank has indeed released a report benchmarking infrastructure development, including aspects of PPP regulatory landscapes. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The Private Investment Unit focuses on policy-level matters, while the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the institutional framework and mechanisms related to PPPs in India. The distractors are carefully designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of institutional roles and functions.


**8. With reference to Intellectual Property and Traditional Knowledge, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Initiative                                     Key Feature
    1. Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) : Addresses the interface between IP, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge
    2. Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge: Prevents biopiracy and wrongful patents
    3. India's Patent Act, 1970                       : Adopted the PDR mechanism for disclosure of involved GRs and TK
    4. UNESCO                                         : Recognized Yoga as Intangible Cultural Heritage

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's Patent Act, 1970, did indeed adopt the Prior Disclosure Rights (PDR) mechanism to protect traditional knowledge and genetic resources. UNESCO has recognized Yoga as an element of intangible cultural heritage.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge addresses the interface between IP, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge, while TKDL is a digital repository designed to prevent biopiracy. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of legal and institutional frameworks designed to protect traditional knowledge and genetic resources in India, requiring both factual recall and understanding of the interplay between different mechanisms.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's detailed understanding of these legal instruments.


**1. With reference to Indian Financial Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                     Governing Body/Ministry
1.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :  Ministry of Finance
2.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) : Reserve Bank of India
3.  Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd (SECI)   :  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
4.  International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) : Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair relating to SECI is correctly matched.  SECI, the Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd, is indeed a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.

The other options are incorrect due to the following reasons:

* **Option 1 (NPCI):** While the Ministry of Finance plays a significant role in overseeing the financial sector, NPCI's governance is primarily through its board of directors consisting of representatives from various banks and financial institutions.  It's not directly under the Ministry of Finance's administrative control.

* **Option 2 (IREDA):** IREDA, the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited, is under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  RBI's role is primarily in regulating financial institutions, not directly administering them.

* **Option 4 (IFSCA):** The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) is a statutory body established under the IFSC Act, 2019. It's an independent regulatory authority, not under the control of SEBI.  While there might be some overlap in regulatory functions concerning financial markets, IFSCA has its own distinct jurisdiction.


**2. With reference to Agricultural Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature/Component
1.  PM KUSUM Component-A                    :  Convergence with AIF for farmer/group of farmers
2.  FASAL Project                              :  Improvement in yield estimation using space technology
3.  KISAN (Crop Insurance)                    :  Streamlining services and scheme delivery to farmers
4.  Agri Stack (Kisan ki Pehchaan)            :  Integrates remote sensing data into a geospatial system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer includes pairs 1, 2, and 3.

* **Pair 1:** PM KUSUM Component-A does indeed allow convergence with the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF) for various entities, including individual farmers and farmer producer organizations.

* **Pair 2:** The FASAL (Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations) project primarily focuses on providing early forecasts of crop output, but it also indirectly contributes to better yield estimation.

* **Pair 3:** KISAN, the crop insurance scheme, leverages space technology and geoinformatics for improved risk assessment and claims processing, indirectly aiding in streamlining services and scheme delivery.

Pair 4 is incorrect because Agri Stack's core function is to create a farmer-centric digital public infrastructure (DPI), not integrating remote sensing data directly into a geospatial system. That function is more closely associated with the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS).


**3. With reference to  Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                  Focus/Objective
1. One Future Alliance                         : Establishment of a Global DPI Repository
2. Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)             : Capacity building in low and middle-income countries
3. EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)      : Accelerating DPI development and deployment globally
4.  Social Impact Fund (SIF)                  :  Funding support for DPI implementation in the Global South


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is explicitly designed to create a centralized resource and knowledge base for DPI.

* **Pair 3:** The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) includes collaboration on DPI to promote its global adoption.

* **Pair 4:** The Social Impact Fund (SIF) is specifically intended to provide financial support for DPI implementation in developing countries.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  The One Future Alliance is primarily focused on capacity building and technical assistance, not the establishment of the GDPIR.  The GDPIR's establishment is a separate initiative.


**4. With reference to  Infrastructure Development in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Policy                                     Key Characteristic
1.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan                 :  Driven by seven engines (Railways, Roads, Ports etc.)
2.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)              :  Focuses on private sector investment in existing government assets
3.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee    :  Evaluates central sector PPP projects
4.  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) Regulations 2024 : Allow issuance of subordinate units by privately placed InvITs only to sponsors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.

* **Pair 1:**  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is indeed driven by seven engines representing key infrastructure sectors.

* **Pair 2:** The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to leverage private sector investment by monetizing existing government assets.

* **Pair 3:** The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a crucial role in evaluating central sector PPP projects.

* **Pair 4:** The 2024 InvIT Regulations do allow for the issuance of subordinate units by privately placed InvITs to sponsors, primarily to address valuation discrepancies during asset acquisitions.


**5. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    CRA                                             Regulatory Oversight
1.  Acuite Ratings & Research                       :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
2.  CRISIL                                          :  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
3.  Brickwork Ratings                               :  Both RBI and SEBI
4.  India Ratings and Research                      :  Only SEBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.

* **Pair 1:** Acuite Ratings & Research, like most other major CRAs, is under the regulatory oversight of both SEBI and RBI.  RBI's accreditation is specifically for their role in rating bank loans, while SEBI's oversight pertains to their broader credit rating activities.

* **Pair 2:** CRISIL is also regulated by both SEBI and RBI, mirroring the regulatory framework for other prominent CRAs.

* **Pair 3:** Brickwork Ratings is unique in that it is the only one of the major agencies that has not received RBI accreditation as an External Credit Assessment Institution for rating bank loan/facilities. However, it is still regulated by SEBI.

Pair 4 is incorrect; India Ratings and Research is regulated by both SEBI and RBI.  The regulatory framework for CRAs in India involves both SEBI and RBI, depending on the specific functions and types of ratings provided.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Organization        Specific Function/Initiative
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)              :  Conceptualization of Project Nexus
2. Bank for International Settlements (BIS) :  Operationalization of Digital Bharat Nidhi
3. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI): Regulation of Venture Capital Funds
4. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID): Implementation of Jute I-CARE Project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The RBI is a participant in Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative to enable instant cross-border retail payments.  While the BIS conceptualized Project Nexus, the RBI's role is participation, not conceptualization. Therefore, pair 1 is partially correct, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of an organization's involvement in international projects.  SEBI's regulatory role over Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) in India is well-established, making pair 3 entirely correct.  The operationalization of the Digital Bharat Nidhi is handled by the Department of Telecommunication (DoT), not the BIS.  Finally, the Jute I-CARE project is implemented by the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), not NaBFID. This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between conceptualization, participation, and implementation roles of various financial institutions and their specific areas of regulation.  Distractors are designed to test knowledge of related but distinct roles of these organizations.


**2. With reference to Infrastructure Financing and Development in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                  Characteristic/Function
1. Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) :  Regulated solely by the RBI
2.  National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID):  Established under the Companies Act, 2013
3.  Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)     :  Operated by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
4.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)   :  Funded entirely through private investment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

NaBFID's establishment under the Companies Act, 2013, is a direct factual statement.  InvITs are regulated by SEBI, not solely by the RBI.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors are developed and operated by Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL), a special purpose vehicle under the Ministry of Railways, not the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.  Finally, MMLPs receive funding from both public and private sources, not exclusively private investment. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific legal frameworks and operational structures of various infrastructure development entities in India.  The distractors highlight commonly held but inaccurate assumptions about the governance and funding of these projects.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Specific Feature/Objective
1.  Project Nexus                               :  Exclusively focuses on payments within BRICS nations
2.  Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR): Established under the Societies Registration Act, 1860
3.  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS): Measures Financial Inclusion through NAFINDEX
4.  Global Energy Efficiency Alliance (GEEA): Launched at COP29 in Azerbaijan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Project Nexus links India with four ASEAN nations, not exclusively BRICS. ICAR's establishment under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 is factually correct. NAFIS uses NAFINDEX to measure financial inclusion, which is also correct.  However, the Global Energy Efficiency Alliance's launch location is not definitively stated to be COP29 in Azerbaijan in the given text.  The question tests knowledge of specific features of Indian and global initiatives in agriculture, finance, and energy efficiency.  The distractors include plausible but inaccurate details about the scope and origins of these entities.


**4. With reference to India's Space Economy, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                    Specific Function/Characteristic
1.  Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe):  Established in 2020
2.  New Space India Limited (NSIL)           :  Handles commercial activities of ISRO
3.  Indian Space Association (ISpA)          :  An autonomous agency under the Department of Space
4.  Venture Capital Fund for SpaceTech        :  Aims to increase India's share in the global commercial space economy to 10% by 2030


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

NSIL's role in handling ISRO's commercial activities is accurate.  The goal of the Venture Capital Fund to increase India's share in the global commercial space economy is also correct.  However, IN-SPACe is not established in 2020 and ISpA is a private industry body, not an autonomous agency under the Department of Space. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of key organizations and initiatives driving India's space sector.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect dates and organizational descriptions creates challenging distractors.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                    Key Provision/Feature
1.  Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024 :  Applies to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons
2.  Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024: Replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
3.  SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999: Mandates disclosure of rating criteria and methodology by CRAs
4.  Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987:  Promotes the use of non-jute packaging materials

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only


**Explanation:**

The Digital Bharat Nidhi rules replaced USOF, and SEBI regulations mandate disclosure by CRAs, are both accurate.  However, the Offshore Areas Rules exclude mineral oils and hydrocarbons, and the Jute Packaging Act promotes jute, not non-jute materials. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific provisions of various acts and regulations related to natural resources management, telecommunications, and finance.  The distractors use slightly altered or misleading statements related to the actual provisions, testing the candidate's detailed understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                     Key Feature/Provision
1. TRIPS Agreement                         :   Compulsory licensing allowed for developing countries
2. OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS  :   Global Minimum Corporate Tax (GMCT) of 15%
3. Marrakesh Agreement                     :   Established the WTO in 1995
4. Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies       :   Moratorium on Distant Water Fishing for 25 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS Agreement, a cornerstone of the WTO, notably includes provisions for compulsory licensing, a mechanism that allows developing countries to produce patented products without the patent holder's consent under specific circumstances. This flexibility is crucial for public health and access to essential medicines.  The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is a significant global initiative aimed at curbing tax avoidance by multinational corporations. A key element of this framework is the implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, designed to prevent tax competition and ensure fairer tax practices. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, marked the culmination of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, replacing GATT as the primary international body governing global trade.  The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, while aiming to curb harmful fishing subsidies that deplete fish stocks, does *not* include a 25-year moratorium on distant water fishing.  While the agreement seeks to reduce such practices, a specific 25-year moratorium is not a stated provision.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Initiative                Description/Feature
1. Duty Drawback                            :   Rebates customs duty on imported materials used in export goods
2. Windfall Tax                              :   Tax imposed on industries with significantly above-average profits
3.  RoDTEP Scheme                           :   Replaces the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme
4. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)     :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Duty Drawback scheme, under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, provides rebates on customs duties paid on imported inputs used in the manufacture of export goods, thereby mitigating costs for exporters.  A windfall tax is a levy imposed on industries experiencing unexpectedly high profits due to favorable market conditions.  The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme indeed replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative aiming to generate substantial investment by monetizing existing government assets, with a target of ₹6 lakh crore over a four-year period (FY22-FY25).  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                   Role/Function
1. CBIC                                     :   Administers Central GST and IGST
2. DPIIT                                    :   Formulates FDI policy in India
3. SEBI                                     :   Governs Venture Capital Funds (VCFs)
4. IIFT                                     :   Focuses on foreign trade and international business research


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) is responsible for the administration of various indirect taxes, including the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) and the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST).  The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) serves as the nodal department for the formulation and implementation of India's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates various aspects of the securities market, including Venture Capital Funds (VCFs). The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is a premier institution specializing in foreign trade, international business research, training, and education.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement/Initiative                   Characteristic/Outcome
1. Agreement on Agriculture                  :   Peace Clause as an interim solution for PSH
2.  WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies   :   Adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva
3.  TRIPS Agreement                          :  Incorporated provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions
4.  Doha Declaration on TRIPS Agreement     :  Affirmed that TRIPS does not prevent measures to protect public health


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Agreement on Agriculture within the WTO framework includes the "Peace Clause," an interim measure addressing the issue of public stockholding for food security.  The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies was indeed adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference held in Geneva. The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions, setting minimum standards for intellectual property protection. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement explicitly affirms that the TRIPS Agreement does not, and should not, prevent member countries from implementing measures necessary to protect public health.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Tax Initiative/Agreement     Key Feature/Objective
1.  OECD Global Minimum Tax                 :   Mandates a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on corporate profits
2.  UN Global Tax Treaty                     :   Aims to establish a fair and effective international tax system
3.  MAP (Mutual Agreement Procedure)        :   Resolves transfer pricing disputes arising from DTAs
4.  DTAA (Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement):  Aims to avoid double taxation of the same asset in two countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The OECD Global Minimum Tax aims to establish a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on the profits of multinational enterprises (MNEs), preventing tax competition and ensuring a more equitable distribution of tax revenue. The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to create a more legitimate, fair, stable, inclusive, and effective international tax system.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism within Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) used to resolve disputes related to transfer pricing – the pricing of goods and services exchanged between related entities in different countries.  Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) are bilateral agreements designed to prevent double taxation of income earned by residents of one country in another.  All three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Ministry/Organization
1. RoDTEP Scheme                         :   Ministry of External Affairs
2. Trade Connect e-Platform             :   Ministry of Commerce and Industry
3. Project Nexus                           :   Reserve Bank of India
4. One Future Alliance                    :    World Trade Organisation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme is indeed launched by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, aiming to refund taxes and levies on exported goods. Option (a) is incorrect as the Ministry of External Affairs is not directly involved in the RoDTEP scheme.  The Trade Connect e-platform is also correctly paired with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. This platform facilitates international trade for Indian exporters, particularly MSMEs.  Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative for instant cross-border retail payments, is correctly linked to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which joined this initiative to enhance cross-border payment systems. Option (d) is incorrect as the One Future Alliance is a G20 initiative, not directly associated with the World Trade Organization (WTO), although WTO may be a supporting partner.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution               Key Function/Characteristic
1. Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) :   Regulated by IFSCA
2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :  Governs Venture Capital Funds
3. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) : Developed UPI
4. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :  AIFI under RBI Act 1934


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is a premier business institution focusing on foreign trade, not regulated by IFSCA (International Financial Services Centres Authority).  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) does govern Venture Capital Funds in India through the SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is correctly paired with developing UPI (Unified Payments Interface). The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is not an All India Financial Institution (AIFI) under the RBI Act, 1934; that designation applies to other entities. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Agreement/Policy                  Primary Focus/Characteristic
1.  TRIPS Agreement                        :   Focuses solely on geographical indications
2.  Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement:   Restricts the use of compulsory licensing
3.  Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024 :   Replaced the USOF
4.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer's Rights Act, 2001 :   Governs cross-border payments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement covers a broad range of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, and geographical indications; it's not solely focused on geographical indications, making option (a) incorrect. The Doha Declaration affirms the right of members to utilize flexibilities within the TRIPS Agreement, including compulsory licensing, to protect public health, contradicting option (b). The Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024, correctly replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, deals with plant varieties and farmers' rights, not cross-border payments, rendering option (d) incorrect. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Initiative                         Description/Feature
1.  Trade Deficit                            :   Value of exports exceeds imports
2.  FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)         :   Always requires government approval
3.  Carry Trade                              :   Involves borrowing in a high-interest-rate currency
4.  Masala Bonds                             :   Denominated in a foreign currency other than the US dollar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports exceed its exports, making statement 1 correct. Option (b) is incorrect because FDI can be through the automatic route (no government approval needed). A carry trade involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a high-interest-rate currency or asset, making statement 3 incorrect. Masala bonds are rupee-denominated bonds issued in overseas markets, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Concept            Characteristic/Function
1. NaBFID (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development)  :   Supervised by the Ministry of Finance
2.  IIBX (India International Bullion Exchange)  :   Located in Mumbai
3.  Invest India                             :   Predicted $325 billion e-commerce market by 2030
4.  CLS (Continuous Linked Settlement)      :   Settles trades in only two currencies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NaBFID is regulated by the RBI, not the Ministry of Finance, making statement 1 incorrect. The IIBX is located in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, not Mumbai, making statement 2 incorrect. Invest India's prediction of a $325 billion e-commerce market by 2030 is accurate. CLS settles trades in more than two currencies, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Implementing Entity/Key Feature
1. National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) : World Bank
2. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                     : Indigenous bovine breed conservation
3. Pandemic Fund Project                       :  Asian Development Bank (ADB)
4. Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip'): Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) aims to control and eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis. While it involves international collaboration, the primary implementing entity is the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying within the Indian government, making option 1 incorrect.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission's core objective is the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds in India, thus option 2 is correct. The Pandemic Fund Project, a $25 million initiative, is indeed supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), along with the World Bank and FAO. This makes option 3 correct. Finally, the Unified Genomic Chip initiative ('Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip') was developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, confirming the accuracy of option 4.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative/Technology          Description/Feature
1. Agri Stack ('Kisan ki Pehchaan')           :  Soil Profile Mapping
2. Krishi Decision Support System (DSS)     : Uses data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS
3. KISAN (Crop Insurance)                   : Integrates remote sensing data with geospatial systems
4. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)        : Provides yield estimates through DGCES

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Agri Stack, with its 'Kisan ki Pehchaan' component, focuses on creating a farmer-centric digital platform for streamlined service delivery.  It involves farmer IDs, geo-referenced village maps, and a crop-sown registry;  Soil Profile Mapping is a separate initiative. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes data from RISAT-1A and the Visualization of Earth observation Data and Archival System (VEDAS) of the Department of Space, making option 2 correct. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) uses space technology for improved yield estimation, not the integration of remote sensing data with geospatial systems, which is the function of the DSS. Option 3 is thus incorrect.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a data exchange platform for farmer services, not a system for providing yield estimates via DGCES. Option 4 is also incorrect.  Only option 2 accurately reflects the described initiative and its feature.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987          :  Established Jute Corporation of India
2. Jute I-CARE Project                         : Aims at mechanization in jute farming
3.  Agricultural Export Policy, 2018          : Set a target of $60 billion agricultural exports by 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandated the compulsory use of jute packaging materials; it did not establish the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), which was established much earlier in 1971. Option 1 is therefore incorrect. The Jute I-CARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) Project focuses on mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting using microbial consortium, making option 2 correct.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, indeed set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, making option 3 correct.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Function/Characteristic
1. NABARD's NAFIS (2021-22)                 : Measures Financial Inclusion through NAFINDEX
2.  PACS (Primary Agriculture Credit Societies) : Regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  NaBFID (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development) :  Established under the Companies Act, 2013
4.  DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation) : Insures deposits up to Rs. 5 lakhs in commercial banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NABARD's NAFIS (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development's All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey) does indeed provide data used to measure financial inclusion through the NAFINDEX, making option 1 correct. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies; they are not directly regulated by the RBI.  Option 2 is incorrect. NaBFID was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not the Companies Act, 2013, although it was notified as a Public Financial Institution under the Companies Act, 2013. Option 3 is therefore incorrect. DICGC does provide deposit insurance coverage up to Rs. 5 lakhs for deposits in commercial banks, making option 4 correct.  Only options 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Logistics Initiative/Policy                  Feature/Objective
1.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)       :  Investment outlay of $6.2 Billion
2.  Bharatmala Pariyojana                    : Construction of 65,000 km of National Highways
3.  RELOS (Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement) :  Access to logistics facilities at each other's military bases
4.  Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)       :  Increase rail freight traffic share to 45% by 2030

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The government's plan for Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) does indeed involve a planned investment outlay of $6.2 billion, making option 1 correct. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways, confirming the accuracy of option 2.  The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) is designed to enable militaries to access logistics and support facilities at each other's bases, making option 3 correct.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are intended to contribute to increasing the share of rail freight traffic, aiming for 45% by 2030, thus option 4 is also correct. All four pairs are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                    Focus Area
1. National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) :  Expansion of oil palm cultivation in North Eastern States
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)              :  Seed breeding and distribution for oilseeds
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)       :  Ensuring MSP for oilseed farmers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) primarily focuses on improving the production of oilseeds, including seed components (breeding, distribution), production inputs, and technology transfer. While it indirectly contributes to overall oilseed production, its core objective isn't the expansion of oil palm cultivation in specific regions.  That is the main focus of the National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), which aims to significantly increase oil palm cultivation, particularly in the North Eastern States and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.  Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) directly addresses the issue of ensuring Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for oilseed farmers, providing price support and deficiency payments to protect them from distress selling. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 incorrectly attributes seed breeding and distribution as the primary focus of NMEO-OP.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) :  Data exchange platform for farmer services
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)           :  Improved yield estimation using space technology
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Tech-driven solution for informed decision-making in agriculture

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

KISAN is specifically designed for improving yield estimation through the innovative use of space technology and geoinformatics.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a data exchange platform, providing crucial datasets related to farmers, their locations, and the crops they cultivate.  Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) leverages advanced technologies like AI, remote sensing, and GIS to facilitate informed decision-making in the agricultural sector.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly swap the key features of KISAN and ADeX.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                          Characteristic
1. Wheat                                         :   Grown primarily in rainfed areas
2. Pulses                                        :   High protein content (20-25% by weight)
3. Millets                                       :   Low Glycemic Index

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While wheat cultivation includes both irrigated and rainfed areas, a significant portion is indeed rainfed, making statement 1 partially true but not precise enough for a perfect match. Pulses are indeed known for their high protein content, ranging from 20% to 25% by weight.  Millets are characterized by their low glycemic index, beneficial for managing diabetes. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is inaccurate because it oversimplifies the cultivation of wheat.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                         Objective
1. SPICED (Sustainability in spice sector…)     :   Increase productivity of large cardamom
2. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) :   Improve infrastructure for agricultural exports
3. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme        :   Promote specific products in specific markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SPICED scheme aims to improve the overall sustainability and competitiveness of the spice sector, including cardamom, but its focus isn't solely on increasing the productivity of large cardamom.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) directly supports improvements in infrastructure relevant to agricultural exports. The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme specifically focuses on promoting particular agricultural products in targeted international markets.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is too narrow in its description of the SPICED scheme.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Organization                      Function/Characteristic
1. APEDA                                       :   Oversees organic export certification
2. NaBFID                                      :   Regulated by the RBI
3. Food Corporation of India (FCI)              :   Nodal agency for procuring wheat and paddy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) plays a crucial role in promoting agricultural exports and is involved in overseeing the accreditation of certification bodies for organic exports.  The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) is indeed regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) acts as the primary central procuring agency for wheat and paddy. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these pairings.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Term                     Description
1. Middle Income Trap                           :  Rapidly growing economies stagnate at middle-income levels
2. Preston Curve                               :   Analyzes India's growth story
3. Household Savings Rate                       :   Ratio of household savings to GDP

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The "middle-income trap" accurately describes the phenomenon where economies fail to transition from middle-income to high-income status. The Preston Curve is indeed a tool used to analyze economic growth trends, particularly in the context of India's development trajectory.  The household savings rate is correctly defined as the ratio of household savings to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  The descriptions provided are accurate and reflect established economic concepts.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   E-commerce Model                            Characteristic
1. Inventory Based Model                       :  100% FDI permitted under automatic route
2. Marketplace Based Model                     :  E-commerce entity owns the inventory
3. Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC)   :  Open-source e-commerce network


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

In the inventory-based e-commerce model, the e-commerce entity directly owns and sells the goods, unlike the marketplace model where it acts as a facilitator.  FDI regulations in India restrict FDI in inventory-based models to protect domestic retailers.  The marketplace model allows 100% FDI under the automatic route. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is an open-source platform designed to promote inclusivity and competition in the e-commerce space.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 have their characteristics incorrectly assigned.

2. Cardamom (Large)                             :   Prefers acidic, loamy soil
3. Spices (India)                               :  Chilli constitutes less than 76% of total production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Small cardamom is indigenous to the Western Ghats, not the sub-Himalayan regions. Large cardamom prefers specific climatic conditions, including acidic, loamy soil, as stated.  Chilli, cumin, turmeric, ginger, and coriander together make up about 76% of India's total spice production. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 contains an incorrect geographical location for small cardamom cultivation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Gokul Mission's primary goal is the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, aiming to enhance their productivity.  The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) is a significant initiative focused on controlling and eradicating Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, diseases that severely impact livestock health and productivity.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because Gau Chip is for cattle, not buffaloes; Mahish Chip is for buffaloes. Option (b) is incorrect as it only includes the Rashtriya Gokul Mission. Option (d) is partially correct regarding the Rashtriya Gokul Mission and NADCP but incorrectly includes the inaccurate pairing of Mahish Chip with cattle.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related but distinct initiatives in the Indian livestock sector.  This requires a clear understanding of the specific objectives and target animals for each program.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Role in Pandemic Fund Project

3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)     :   Primary funder of the project
4. G20 Pandemic Fund                          :   Established under Indonesia's G20 Presidency (2022)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pandemic Fund Project, a $25 million initiative, is implemented by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). While the G20 Pandemic Fund provided the funding, the implementing entities are responsible for the project's execution. Thus, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the ADB. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the ADB's role. Option (d) is incorrect because the FAO is an implementing entity, not the primary funder. The G20 Pandemic Fund is the primary source of funding.  The question tests knowledge about international organizations and their roles in global health initiatives, demanding an understanding of the collaborative nature of such projects and the differentiation between funding and implementation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

The Jute I-CARE Project aims at mechanizing jute farming and accelerating retting through microbial consortia.  The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandated the compulsory use of jute packaging, indirectly supporting the jute industry. NABARD's NAFIS survey provides a comprehensive overview of rural financial inclusion.  Initiatives for PACS modernization focus on expanding and modernizing Primary Agriculture Credit Societies. Thus, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is partially correct but omits the PACS initiatives. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly pairs the Jute Packaging Materials Act with price support. Option (d) is incorrect because the Jute Packaging Materials Act's primary objective isn't price support; its focus is on the compulsory use of jute packaging. The question assesses conceptual understanding of various government initiatives and their specific goals, demanding accurate recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct objectives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Initiative                                  Key Component or Feature

4.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan     :   Driven by 7 engines (Railways, Roads, Ports, etc.)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Agri Stack is a digital platform with components like farmer registries, geo-referenced village maps, and crop sown registries, but its core function isn't directly integrating remote sensing data.  The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) uses remote sensing data, not the issuance of Farmer IDs, which is part of Agri Stack. The Digital Crop Survey utilizes remote sensing data, including that from RISAT-1A. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is indeed driven by seven engines. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the PM GatiShakti aspect. Option (c) is partially correct but mismatches DSS and Digital Crop Survey.  Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatching of several pairs.  The question tests the understanding of the components and features of different agricultural and infrastructure initiatives in India, requiring a detailed knowledge of their functionalities and how they interconnect.

2. Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS)     :   Are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)                       :   Unaffiliated with any government-led financial inclusion programs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrect. NAFIS focuses on rural financial inclusion (option 1). PACS are not directly regulated by the RBI, although they are part of the cooperative credit structure (option 2). KCC is a government-led initiative aimed at promoting financial inclusion among farmers (option 3). This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various financial inclusion initiatives in India. The incorrect options provide misleading information, emphasizing the need for accurate knowledge.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Mission/Scheme                 :   Core Objective
1. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) :   Exclusively focuses on cereal crop production
2. Digital Agriculture Mission                    :   Does not utilize remote sensing data for decision support
3. Sustainable livestock health and production scheme:   Focuses only on disease prevention in livestock


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. MIDH has a broader scope than just cereal crops; it encompasses various horticultural products (option 1). The Digital Agriculture Mission heavily relies on remote sensing data for its decision support system (option 2). The sustainable livestock scheme addresses both health and production aspects, not just disease prevention (option 3).  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various agricultural missions and schemes in India, requiring a thorough understanding of their objectives.

1. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)          :   Measures poverty solely based on income levels
2. Global MPI                                   :   Does not include indicators related to living standards
3. India’s National MPI (NMPI)                   :   Uses data exclusively from the Census of India



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrect.  The MPI considers multiple deprivation factors beyond income (option 1). The Global MPI includes indicators related to health, education, and living standards (option 2). The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not solely the Census of India (option 3).  This question assesses understanding of poverty measurement methodologies. The incorrect options provide misleading information, highlighting the need for accurate knowledge.  The question also tests the candidate's awareness of the nuances in different poverty measures.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                       Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) :   Seaweed cultivation targeting 1 million tons annually by 2025
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) : Promotion of fisheries start-ups and cooperatives
3. National Fisheries Development Program Portal :   Creation of fisheries infrastructure in marine and inland sectors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PMMSY aims to address critical gaps in fish production and productivity, encompassing various aspects including seaweed cultivation.  The ambitious goal of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025 is a key component of this scheme.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The FIDF is primarily focused on creating fisheries infrastructure, including both marine and inland facilities, to enhance fish production. Pair 2 is incorrect because while PMMSY does indirectly support startups, FIDF's direct focus is on infrastructure.  The establishment of incubation centers is a separate initiative.

The National Fisheries Development Program Portal was established under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana, a sub-scheme under PMMSY. The portal's purpose is to facilitate access to information and resources related to fisheries development.  Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of pair 3. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes pair 2. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the mismatched pair 2.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                          Key Objective
1. Steel Scrap Recycling Policy 2019      :   Promote use of green hydrogen in steelmaking
2. National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) :   Facilitate establishment of metal scrapping centers
3. Carbon Credit Trading Scheme           :   Reduce greenhouse gas emissions across sectors, including steel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Steel Scrap Recycling Policy 2019 aims to establish and promote scientific processing and recycling of ferrous scrap, not the use of green hydrogen.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) does indeed promote the use of green hydrogen in various sectors, including steelmaking,  but it's not focused solely on steel.  Therefore, pair 2 is also incorrect.

The Carbon Credit Trading Scheme's main objective is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across multiple sectors of the Indian economy through a market-based mechanism. The steel sector is one among many sectors included.  Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. Only option (c) accurately reflects the primary objective of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                  Initiative/Report
1. NITI Aayog                               :   Strategy for the development of Seaweed Value Chain
2. Department of Biotechnology              :   Global Bio-India initiative
3. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR):   Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip')


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog published the report titled “Strategy for the development of Seaweed Value Chain”.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Department of Biotechnology is the driving force behind Global Bio-India, a strategic initiative to advance the bio-economy.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, under the umbrella of ICAR, developed the Unified Genomic Chip, including the 'Gau Chip' for cattle and 'Mahish Chip' for buffalo.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.

All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                         Specific Aim/Component
1. National Food Security Mission (NFSM)    :   Expand oil palm cultivation to 10 lakh hectares
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) : Increase production of pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) : Provide MSP for oilseeds to farmers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) focuses on increasing the production of pulses and oilseeds through various measures including area expansion and improved productivity.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.

The National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) is specifically designed to expand oil palm cultivation, aiming for 10 lakh hectares by 2025-26.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) does include a price support scheme that ensures oilseed farmers receive the Minimum Support Price (MSP).  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.

Only pair 3 is correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                      Relevant Initiative/Policy
1. Jute                                       :   National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)
2. Millets                                   :   Crop Diversification Programme (CDP)
3. Pulses                                     :   National Jute Development Programme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) focuses on oilseeds and oil palm, not jute.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) aims to promote diversification away from traditional crops in certain regions, but it's not specifically focused on millets.  While millets could benefit, it's not the program's sole or primary focus. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The National Jute Development Programme is related to jute production and industry development, not pulses. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.

Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Inclusion Index Parameter          Description
1. Access                                     :   Captures the availability of financial services
2. Usage                                      :   Reflects the extent of utilization of financial services
3. Quality                                     :   Measures the effectiveness and efficiency of financial services delivery
4.  Publication Frequency                      :   Annually in March
5. Index Range                                :   0 to 100, where 0 represents complete exclusion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) is a composite index designed to measure the level of financial inclusion in India.  The three main parameters are Access, Usage, and Quality.  Access refers to the availability of financial services,  Usage reflects how much these services are utilized by the population, and Quality assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. The index operates on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 signifies complete financial inclusion and 0 signifies complete exclusion.   The FI-Index is published annually; however, the text specifies March, but this is not always the case. Therefore, options including 4 are incorrect. Option (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect because they omit or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Initiative
1. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) :   Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)
2.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  :   Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     :   Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)
4. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)                :  Hallmark certification
5.  United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS): Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) Trust Fund Manager


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNDP publishes the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) in collaboration with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).  The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for the Hallmark certification, a guarantee of the purity of precious metals. UNOPS manages the EIF Trust Fund.  The RBI is not involved with the PMMY, and the TKDL is an Indian initiative, not directly under WIPO's purview, though WIPO works with the concept of traditional knowledge. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                  Key Feature
1.  TRIPS Agreement                             :   Compulsory licensing allowed
2.  Agreement on Agriculture                     :   Peace Clause for Public Stockholding
3.  Telecommunications Act, 2023                :   Established the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)
4.  BIS Act, 2016                               :   ISI Mark Scheme
5.  RBI Act, 1934                               :   Regulates NaBFID as an AIFI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing under certain conditions, enabling countries to produce patented products without the patent holder's consent.  The Agreement on Agriculture includes a Peace Clause to address concerns about public stockholding programs. The Telecommunications Act of 2023 established the DBN. The RBI Act, 1934, provides the regulatory framework for NaBFID. While the BIS Act, 2016, established the BIS, the ISI Mark Scheme is a function of BIS, not a direct feature of the Act itself. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are accurately matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Agricultural Initiative                Description
1. KISAN                                      :   Uses Space technology for crop improvement
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)          :   Includes farmer identity and geotagged farm location data
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre:   Employs AI and remote sensing technologies
4.  PMMY                                      :   Provides loans to non-corporate small businesses
5.  India’s Agriculture Export Policy, 2018    :   Set a $60 billion export target by 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

KISAN utilizes space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation. ADeX is an agricultural data exchange platform containing farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data. The Krishi ICCC uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS for decision-making in agriculture.  India's Agriculture Export Policy 2018 aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.  PMMY is a broader initiative for small businesses, not specifically agricultural.  Therefore options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect because they either omit or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Microfinance Loan under PMMY      Loan Amount
1. Shishu                                     :   Up to ₹10 lakh
2. Kishore                                    :   Above ₹10 lakh to ₹50 lakh
3. Tarun                                      :   Above ₹50 lakh to ₹100 lakh
4. Tarun Plus                                 :   Up to ₹20 lakh for those who successfully repaid Tarun loans
5.  All Microfinance Loans                     : Up to ₹3,00,000 annual income households


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Under PMMY, Shishu loans are for amounts up to ₹10 lakh. The Tarun Plus category extends the loan limit to ₹20 lakh for those who have successfully repaid previous Tarun loans.  The descriptions for Kishore and Tarun are incorrect; these categories have different upper limits. The definition of a microfinance loan by RBI relates to household annual income, not loan amount.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c) and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Associated Entity/Feature
1. Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)       :   World Trade Organization (WTO)
2. Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                 :   Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
3. National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for AVGC-XR :   Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership supported by various international organizations, including the World Trade Organization (WTO), aiming to assist Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), making pair 3 correct.  However, the relationship between DBN and USOF is one of replacement, not direct association as a feature. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched. The National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR) is provisionally named the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC), making pair 3 correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Publishing Entity
1. Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index             :   Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade
2. World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) :   Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
3. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)   :   Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) is indeed consolidated under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), making pair 2 correct. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), making pair 3 also correct. However, the Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index is a World Bank initiative;  the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade uses some of its indicators in its own rankings, but it does not publish the B-Ready Index.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Option (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they include the mismatched pair 1.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Act                                   Key Feature/Provision
1. Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies             :   Moratorium on Distant Water Fishing
2. Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) :   Compulsory licensing
3.  Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024 :   Universal Access Levy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb harmful subsidies and includes provisions related to a potential moratorium on distant water fishing, making pair 1 correct. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, a key flexibility for developing countries, thus pair 2 is correct. However, the Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024, operationalize the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), which *replaced* the Universal Access Levy system of the USOF. It did not continue to use the levy.  Thus, pair 3 is incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Key Finding/Feature
1. Human Development Report (HDR)             :   Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)
2. Global Innovation Index (GII)                :   India's Rank at 40
3.  Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)      :   "Crowding out" effect of public investment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Human Development Report (HDR) includes the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) as a key measure, making pair 1 correct. The Global Innovation Index (GII) indeed ranks India at 40th position, making pair 2 correct.  The text mentions the "crowding out" effect as a potential consequence of high levels of public investment relative to private investment, thus pair 3 is also correct.  All three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                 Purpose/Provision
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999            :   Collective rights over traditional knowledge
2.  Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 :   Fair and equitable benefit sharing
3.  Biological Diversity Act, 2002               :   Preventing biopiracy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act 1999 does guarantee collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with geographical indications, making pair 1 correct.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, aims for fair and equitable benefit sharing, making pair 2 correct.  While the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, contributes to preventing biopiracy through its provisions on access and benefit-sharing, its primary purpose is broader than just biopiracy prevention.  Therefore, pair 3 is also considered correct in this context.  All three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement Feature                                  Specific Detail
1. Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)                     :   Contains provisions on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies.
2. WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package) :   Aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion.
3. TRIPS Agreement                                      :   Includes provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) is a cornerstone of the WTO, addressing three key areas: market access (tariffication, tariff reductions), domestic support (subsidies impacting production and trade), and export subsidies (measures making exports artificially competitive). The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, adopted in 2022, directly targets harmful subsidies that deplete global fish stocks, a significant environmental and economic concern.  Finally, the TRIPS Agreement, a comprehensive intellectual property rights (IPR) agreement, incorporates minimum protection standards drawn from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) established Paris and Berne Conventions, ensuring a baseline level of IPR protection for member countries.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all three correctly matched pairs is the accurate response. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Related Term                                      Description
1. Tariffication                                         :   Conversion of non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.
2. De Minimis Limits                                    :   Thresholds for permissible agricultural subsidies.
3. Peace Clause (related to Public Stockholding)       :   Interim solution for food security programs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect WTO-related terminology. Tariffication, a key aspect of the Agreement on Agriculture, involves replacing non-tariff barriers (like quotas and variable levies) with equivalent tariffs, promoting greater market transparency and predictability. De Minimis limits define the permissible levels of agricultural subsidies, differentiating between developed and developing countries to account for varying capacities and needs. The "Peace Clause," agreed upon in Bali, provides temporary protection for countries' public stockholding programs for food security, addressing concerns about trade distortions.  Hence, option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all three pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Policy/Initiative                           Characteristic
1. Public Stockholding (PSH)                             :   Government procurement of crops at MSP for distribution to the poor.
2. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                          :   Minimum price at which the government procures crops from farmers.
3. Agricultural Export Policy (India)                    :   Set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair presents a correct description of an agricultural policy or initiative. Public Stockholding (PSH) involves government procurement of crops at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure food security and prevent distress sales by farmers. The MSP itself is the minimum price guaranteed by the government to farmers for their produce. India's Agricultural Export Policy, though ambitious, aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, though this target was not met. Therefore, option (d), which includes all correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Term                                 Definition/Description
1. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)                  :   Investment in fixed assets like machinery and buildings.
2. Middle-Income Trap                                   :   Stagnation of rapidly growing economies at middle-income levels.
3. Preston Curve                                         :   Illustrates the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately define economic concepts. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) represents investment in fixed assets, a crucial component of economic growth. The Middle-Income Trap describes the phenomenon where economies, after a period of rapid growth, stall at middle-income levels, failing to transition to high-income status. The Preston Curve graphically depicts the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy, showing how increases in income initially lead to significant improvements in life expectancy, but this effect diminishes beyond a certain income level.  Therefore, option (d), encompassing all three correct matches, is the appropriate choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Agricultural Initiative                      Focus/Objective
1. FASAL Project                                    :  Early forecasting of crop output using space technology.
2. KISAN (Crop Insurance)                          :  Improved yield estimation using space technology and geoinformatics.
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)                 :  Data exchange platform for farmer services, including farmer identity and crop data.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs correctly link Indian agricultural initiatives with their primary objectives. The Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations (FASAL) Project utilizes space technology to provide early and accurate forecasts of crop yields.  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) similarly leverages space technology and geoinformatics to enhance yield estimation for improved crop insurance accuracy. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) serves as a centralized platform, aggregating crucial data on farmer identity, farm location, and crops sown, facilitating efficient delivery of agricultural services. Therefore, option (d), including all three correct matches, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan         :   Integrates ISRO satellite imagery
2. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee:   Evaluates central sector PPP projects
3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)       :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25)
4. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)        :  Provides loans up to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes ISRO satellite imagery and other data sources for comprehensive planning. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee's role is explicitly stated as evaluating central sector PPP projects. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment through the monetization of government assets, with a target of ₹6 lakh crore over four years. Finally, the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has indeed enhanced its loan limit to ₹20 lakh under the Tarun Plus category for those who have successfully repaid previous loans.  There are no incorrect pairings or misleading information presented in the options.  Each pair accurately reflects a key feature or characteristic of the stated initiative.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Policy                      Characteristic
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                 :   Covers only Kharif crops
2. India’s Agricultural Export Policy           :   Achieved its $60 billion target by 2022
3. Middle Income Trap                           :   Coined by the World Bank in 2007
4. Preston Curve                               :   Shows a direct proportional relationship between per capita income and life expectancy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement regarding the Middle Income Trap is correct. The World Bank did indeed coin the term "middle-income trap" in 2007. The other statements are incorrect.  MSP covers both Kharif and Rabi crops, along with some commercial crops.  India's Agricultural Export Policy failed to achieve its $60 billion target by 2022.  The Preston Curve shows that the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy is not directly proportional; it plateaus after a certain level of income.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include false statements.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                       Function/Role
1.  Food Corporation of India                    :   Nodal agency for procuring jute and copra
2.  World Bank                                  :   Released the report on Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), 2024
3.  NITI Aayog                                 :  Introduced India’s National MPI (NMPI) in 2021
4.  Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative: Partnered with UNDP on the Global MPI report 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal agency for procuring wheat and paddy, not jute and copra.  The World Bank did not release the MPI report 2024; it was jointly released by UNDP and OPHI. NITI Aayog did introduce the NMPI in 2021, and OPHI partnered with UNDP on the Global MPI report 2024. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include the incorrectly matched pair (1) or (2).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Policy/Agreement                   Description
1. Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)           :   Signed only by multinational corporations
2. Inheritance Tax                               :   Currently levied in India
3. Geographical Indications Act 1999            :   Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge
4.  Creative Destruction                         :   A process described by the World Bank to achieve high-income status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement about Creative Destruction is entirely accurate. The World Bank's report does recommend this as a crucial step for countries aiming for high-income status. The other statements are incorrect.  APAs are signed by both domestic and multinational corporations.  Inheritance tax is not currently levied in India. The Geographical Indications Act 1999 guarantees collective, not individual, rights. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they contain false or partially correct information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Infrastructure Project/Initiative              Characteristic
1. Bharatmala Pariyojana                        :   Focuses on constructing only state highways
2. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)           :   Aims to reduce the share of rail freight traffic
3. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)          :   Planned investment outlay of $6.2 Billion
4.  Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index: Measures freight transport efficiency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana focuses on national highways, not just state highways.  Dedicated Freight Corridors aim to *increase*, not reduce, the share of rail freight traffic.  The planned investment outlay for MMLPs is indeed $6.2 billion, and the LEADS index does measure logistics efficiency across different states.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. With reference to India's economic performance and policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator/Index                                   Key Feature
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024:   India had the lowest number of people in extreme poverty.
2. Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2024:  Nepal performed worse than India.
3. Human Development Index (HDI)                 :   Developed by Mahbub ul-Haq.
4.  Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI):  India's rank improved in 2022 compared to 2021.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The HDI was indeed developed by Mahbub ul-Haq. The other statements are incorrect. The 2024 Global MPI report indicated India had a very high number of people in extreme poverty, not the lowest. The CRI Index 2024 showed Nepal performing better than India. Finally, the provided text doesn't give information on IHDI rank change for India between 2021 and 2022. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**1. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following pairs:**

    Mineral Resource                     Location/Feature
1. Lime mud                             : Off Gujarat & Maharashtra coasts
2. Heavy mineral placers               : Inner-shelf and mid-shelf off Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.
3. Phosphorite                           : Eastern & Western continental margins
4. Polymetallic Ferromanganese nodules : Bay of Bengal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Geological Survey of India has indeed delineated resources of lime mud off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, heavy mineral placers in the inner-shelf and mid-shelf regions off several eastern and western Indian coastlines, and phosphorite deposits along both the eastern and western continental margins.  Option (a) accurately reflects these established findings. Option (d) is incorrect because while polymetallic ferromanganese nodules are found in Indian waters, they are primarily located in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not the Bay of Bengal as suggested. The inclusion of the Bay of Bengal as a location for these nodules is a deliberate distractor, playing on the general knowledge that the Bay of Bengal is a significant part of India's maritime territory. Options (b) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete, omitting crucial correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall regarding the specific locations of different offshore mineral resources in India, emphasizing the importance of precise geographical knowledge in understanding resource distribution.


**2. With reference to India's logistics infrastructure, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                     Key Feature/Objective

2. Bharatmala Pariyojana              : Construction of 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases
3. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) : Aims to increase rail freight traffic share from 27% to 75% by 2030
4. Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index:  Measures the efficiency of logistics across different states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The government's plan for MMLPs and the scope of Bharatmala Pariyojana, as well as the purpose of the LEADS index are correctly stated.  However, the target for Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) to increase rail freight traffic share is not 75%, but 45% by 2030. This is a crucial detail that makes option (d) incorrect. Options (b) and (c) are also incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of major Indian government initiatives aimed at improving logistics efficiency.  The inclusion of a slightly altered figure (75% instead of 45%) for DFCs serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise details.


**3.  With reference to India’s agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                       Key Feature/Objective

**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                      Key Finding/Characteristic
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024 :   India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty
2. NITI Aayog’s Multidimensional Poverty in India since 2005-06 discussion paper :  Poverty Headcount Ratio decreased from 29.17% (2013-14) to 11.28% (2022-23)
3. World Development Report 2024: The Middle Income :  India runs the risk of falling into the middle-income trap


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024 report highlighted that India had the largest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty among the countries assessed.  NITI Aayog's discussion paper on multidimensional poverty in India documented a significant decrease in the poverty headcount ratio between 2013-14 and 2022-23.  The World Bank's World Development Report 2024 specifically mentioned India's risk of falling into the middle-income trap, a situation where economic growth stagnates at middle-income levels.  Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched.  The data presented in each pair is accurate and reflects the findings of the respective reports.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                            Objective/Focus
1.  PM KUSUM Component-A                      :   Convergence with AIF for farmers/groups
2.  Atal Innovation Mission (AIM)               :   Loans with interest subvention for viable farming assets
3.  FASAL Project                               :   Early forecasts of crop output using space technology

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM KUSUM Component-A aims to promote the use of solar power in agriculture and allows for convergence with the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) for financing related projects by farmers and groups. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) is not directly involved in providing loans with interest subvention for viable farming assets; that is a feature of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF). The FASAL project, which uses space technology and other data sources, focuses on providing early forecasts of crop output.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 incorrectly attributes the loan program to the AIM.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Body                             Role/Function
1.  World Economic Forum (WEF)                 :   Released the report “Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies”
2.  One Future Alliance                          :   Aims to build capacity for DPI in low and middle-income countries
3.  EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)       :   Agreed to accelerate DPI development with India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum (WEF) released the report on agritech's role in shaping agriculture in emerging economies.  The One Future Alliance is a G20 initiative aimed at supporting the implementation of digital public infrastructure (DPI) in developing countries.  The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) has collaborated with India to accelerate the development and deployment of DPI globally.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, accurately reflecting the roles and functions of these organizations.  No inaccuracies or misleading information is present in the pairings.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                     Key Indicator/Measurement
1.  Human Development Report (HDR)                 :   Includes the Gender Inequality Index (GII)
2.  Global Innovation Index (GII)                  :   Ranks countries based on innovation capabilities
3.  IP Index                                        :   India's rank is 42 out of 55 economies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Human Development Report (HDR) includes various indices, including the Gender Inequality Index (GII), to assess human development comprehensively. The Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks countries based on their innovation performance across various factors. The IP Index, a separate measure, reported India's rank as 42 out of 55 economies.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key indicators or measurements associated with each report or index.   There are no factual inaccuracies in the pairings.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Legislation/Act                                   Purpose/Provision
1.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer's Rights Act, 2001:   Provides for Community rights over forest resources
2.  Biological Diversity Act, 2002                 :   Aligned to the Convention on Biological Diversity
3.  Forest Rights Act 2006                        :   Provides for fair and equitable benefit sharing of biodiversity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is indeed aligned with the Convention on Biological Diversity, aiming to conserve biological diversity and ensure its sustainable use.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer's Rights Act, 2001, focuses on protecting plant varieties and farmers' rights, not community forest rights.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; the Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants forest rights to forest-dwelling communities, while fair and equitable benefit sharing is a broader principle often addressed through other legislation.  The key here is to accurately link the specific purpose of each act.


**1. With reference to the Indian Agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature
    1. Krishi Decision Support System (DSS)     :   Uses RISAT-1A satellite data
    2. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                 :   Targets 1 million tons of seaweed production annually
    3. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                   :   Focuses on indigenous bovine breed conservation
    4. Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)      :   Provides credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) leverages remote sensing data, including that from RISAT-1A, for real-time agricultural information.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana explicitly aims for a significant increase in seaweed production, targeting one million tons annually. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission is centrally focused on the development and conservation of indigenous cattle breeds in India. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) offers interest subvention and crucially, credit guarantee coverage under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) scheme, especially for loans up to ₹2 Crores.  All four pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective initiatives. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Understanding these schemes is crucial for comprehending India's agricultural policies and their impact.


**2. With reference to India's Livestock and Dairy sectors, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                        Specific Objective/Outcome
    1.  Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme :  Total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore
    2.  Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip')       :   Developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry
    3.  National Programme for Dairy Development  :  Increase organized milk procurement
    4.  Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)                :   Exclusively for crop farmers


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production scheme indeed had a total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore as approved by the cabinet. The Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip') for cattle and the 'Mahish Chip' for buffalo were developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. The National Programme for Dairy Development aims to enhance milk and milk product quality and increase the share of organized milk procurement. Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) are not exclusively for crop farmers; they are also available to livestock and dairy farmers. Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair (KCC).  Understanding these initiatives is important for assessing the government's efforts to improve India's livestock and dairy sectors.


**3. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                     Key Characteristic/Objective
    1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan :   Uses BISAG-N's Digital Master Planning tool
    2. Bharatmala Pariyojana               :   Construction of approximately 65,000 km of National Highways
    3. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)    :   Established under the Indian Companies Act of 1913
    4.  Vadhavan Port                        :   Designated as India's 14th major port


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes the Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N.  Bharatmala Pariyojana's key objective is the construction of approximately 65,000 km of National Highways. Vadhvan Port is indeed being established as a major port in India. However, the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) were incorporated under the Indian Companies Act of 1956, not 1913.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the incorrectly matched pair related to the DFC's incorporation year.  A thorough understanding of these infrastructure initiatives is vital for analyzing India's economic development strategies.


**4.  With reference to India's Textile Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                       Specific Feature/Objective
    1. Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme: Credit-linked subsidy for modernization
    2.  Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SAMARTH): Aims to train 3 lakh persons
    3.  PM MITRA Parks                          :   Focuses solely on cotton textile production
    4. National Technical Textiles Mission     :   Aims to make India a global leader in technical textiles


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme does offer credit-linked subsidies for modernizing the textile industry. The SAMARTH scheme aims to train a large number of individuals in textile-related skills. The National Technical Textiles Mission has the explicit goal of establishing India as a global leader in this specialized area. However, PM MITRA Parks are not solely focused on cotton; they encompass a broader range of textile production and apparel manufacturing.  Therefore, only the first, second, and fourth pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include the incorrectly matched pair concerning PM MITRA Parks.  Understanding these schemes is essential for evaluating government policies aimed at boosting India's textile sector.


**5. With reference to India's Economic Indicators and Policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator/Policy                         Characteristic/Feature
    1. Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)   : Includes Petroleum Refinery Products with the highest weight
    2.  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) : Uses National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data
    3.  Advance Pricing Agreements (APA)      :  Signed by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes (CBIT)
    4.  Inheritance Tax in India               :   Currently levied at a rate of 85%


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) indeed includes Petroleum Refinery Products as a component with the highest weight. India's Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).  However, Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) are signed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), not CBIT.  Furthermore, inheritance tax is not currently levied in India; it was abolished.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs related to APAs and Inheritance Tax.  Understanding these economic indicators and policies is crucial for analyzing India's economic performance and policy direction.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Scheme           Characteristic/Feature
1. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) : Registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
2.  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) :  Covers only commercial banks
3.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)     : Published bi-annually in January and July
4.  National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) : Measures financial inclusion using a single value index (0 to 100)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) uses a single value index (0 to 100) to measure financial inclusion.  The other statements are incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The RB-IOS covers a wider range of entities beyond just commercial banks, including Regional Rural Banks, Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) meeting certain criteria. The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) is published annually, not bi-annually.


**2. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                         Focus/Objective
1. National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) : Primarily focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation in the North Eastern States
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) : Aims to increase oilseed production through price support schemes
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) : Aims to improve yield estimation using space technology and geoinformatics
4. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoinformatics) :  Launched in 2021-22


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. KISAN is indeed an initiative focusing on improving yield estimation using space technology and geoinformatics.  The other pairs are mismatched. NFSM-OS&OP has a broader focus than just oil palm expansion in the North East, encompassing seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer across various oilseeds.  PM-AASHA focuses on ensuring MSP for oilseed farmers, not on increasing oilseed production directly. The NMEO-OP, while related to oil palm, was launched in 2021-22, aiming to expand oil palm cultivation, not directly focusing on price support schemes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator/Concept              Description/Feature
1.  Trade Deficit                             : Occurs when a country's value of exports exceeds imports
2.  Monetary Policy Transmission            : The process by which changes in the repo rate impact the economy
3.  Green Shoots                             : Signs of economic contraction following a period of growth
4.  Carry Trade                               :  Investment strategy involving borrowing in a high-interest rate currency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is accurately matched. Monetary policy transmission describes the mechanism by which changes in central bank policy rates (like the repo rate) influence broader economic variables. The other statements contain errors. A trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports, not the other way around. Green shoots represent signs of economic recovery *after* a downturn, not contraction after growth. A carry trade involves borrowing in a *low*-interest-rate currency to invest in a higher-yielding asset, exploiting the interest rate differential.


**4. With reference to financial regulations and institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Regulation                     Function/Characteristic
1. Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)          :  Develops and administers benchmarks for money market instruments
2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) : Regulates Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs)
3. Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL) : Issues Quality Control Orders (QCOs) for mandatory ISI marking
4. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)               :  Established the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. SEBI does indeed regulate FVCIs. The other statements are inaccurate. The BIS is responsible for setting standards and issuing ISI marks; FBIL develops and administers financial benchmarks; the RBI doesn't directly establish the IIBX;  it's promoted by market infrastructure institutions and operates at GIFT IFSC.  The QCOs for mandatory ISI marking are issued by the Central Government, not the FBIL or RBI.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop/Commodity                              Characteristic/Feature
1.  Millets                                     :  India accounts for a majority of Asia’s and a significant portion of global production
2.  Oilseeds                                   :  Majority of cultivation is rain-fed
3.  Jute                                       :  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) implements the Jute I-CARE project
4.  Wheat                                      :  Food Corporation of India is the nodal procuring agency for this crop


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  India's millet production is substantial, representing a large share of both Asian and global output. A significant portion of India's oilseed cultivation relies on rainfall. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) is actively involved in the Jute I-CARE project. The Food Corporation of India plays a key role in procuring wheat.  There are no inaccuracies in any of the pairings provided.


**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and its regulatory framework, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                     Regulation/Function
    1.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Type I NBFC-ND, accepting public funds
    2.  RBI Ombudsman                          :  Tenure exceeding five years
    3.  Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs)   :  Required to be for-profit companies under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013
    4.  Payment System Participants           :  Under RBI's purview for deposit acceptance above ₹100 crore

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Payment System Participants are indeed under the RBI's purview, and those with assets exceeding ₹100 crore are subject to specific regulations concerning deposit acceptance.  Let's analyze the other pairs:

* **Pair 1:** NUCFDC is explicitly stated as a Type II NBFC-ND, which *does* accept public funds, making the statement incorrect.  Type I NBFCs have different characteristics.

* **Pair 2:** The RBI may appoint an Ombudsman for a tenure not exceeding three years, contradicting the statement.

* **Pair 3:**  SROs are explicitly defined as needing to be *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. The pair incorrectly states they must be for-profit.


**2. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework and Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                  Description
    1.  PCA Framework Effective Date          :  April 1, 2024
    2.  PCA Framework Applicability           :  All UCBs, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID)
    3.  Key Monitoring Areas for UCBs         :  Capital, Asset Quality, and Liabilities
    4.  Replaced Framework                   :  Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The PCA framework does replace the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF). Let's examine the other pairs:

* **Pair 1:** The effective date of the new PCA framework is April 1, 2025, not 2024.

* **Pair 2:** The framework explicitly excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).

* **Pair 3:** While capital and asset quality are key monitoring areas, liabilities are not explicitly mentioned as a primary focus in the provided text. Profitability is mentioned instead of liabilities.


**3. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) and regulations, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Act                                 Characteristic/Detail
    1.  Narasimham Committee II (1998)       :  Proposed the establishment of Asset Management Companies
    2.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                    :  Mandates ARC registration and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
    3.  ARCs' Asset Resolution Time Limit     :  5 years from acquisition
    4.  National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited: Example of an ARC

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Narasimham Committee II did indeed propose asset reconstruction companies, and the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited is a real-world example. Let's look at the other pairs:

* **Pair 2:** The SARFAESI Act, 2002, mandates ARC registration and regulation by the *Reserve Bank of India (RBI)*, not SEBI.

* **Pair 3:** ARCs are required to resolve assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to the Goods and Services Tax (GST):**

    Entity/Act                                  Characteristic/Detail
    1.  GST Council                             :  Decisions require a simple majority vote
    2.  GST Appellate Tribunal                  :  Operates under the State GST Acts only
    3.  101st Constitutional Amendment Act     : Introduced GST in 2018
    4.  Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC):  Currently responsible for collecting GST

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched.  The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act introduced GST in 2017. Let us analyze the other pairs:

* **Pair 1:**  Decisions in the GST Council require a three-fourths majority of weighted votes, not a simple majority.

* **Pair 2:** The GST Appellate Tribunal hears appeals against orders passed under both the CGST Act, 2017, and State GST Acts.

* **Pair 4:** The CBEC's role in GST collection is subsumed under the GST system.  The responsibility is now distributed among various GST authorities.


**5. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Layer                             Feature/Characteristic
    1.  India Stack                               :  Includes a Transportation layer
    2.  One Future Alliance                       :  Aims to hinder DPI implementation in developing countries
    3.  Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)            :  Launched at the G20 summit in 2022
    4.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)          :  Developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

* **Pair 1:** India Stack does not include a Transportation layer; it comprises Identity, Payments, and Data Governance layers.

* **Pair 2:** The One Future Alliance aims to *support* DPI implementation in low- and middle-income countries, not hinder it.

* **Pair 3:** GDPIR was announced at the G20 virtual leaders' summit in 2023, not 2022.

* **Pair 4:** UPI was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not MeitY.


**6. With reference to the Coal Sector in India and its challenges, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Initiative                                 Feature/Impact
    1.  Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015:  Prohibited private entities from commercial coal mining
    2.  Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021: Introduced Composite PL-cum-ML for coal
    3. High Import Dependence of India           : Primarily due to high availability of high GCV coal in India
    4.  Coal India Limited's Contribution           : Less than 50% of India's coal production

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, did introduce the Composite PL-cum-ML for coal.  Let's examine why the others are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The CMSP Act, 2015, *permitted*, not prohibited, the auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities.

* **Pair 3:** India's high import dependence is due to the *lack* of sufficient high GCV coal domestically, not its high availability.

* **Pair 4:** Coal India Limited contributes over 80%, not less than 50%, of India's indigenous coal production.


**7. With reference to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in India and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Initiative                                   Feature/Detail
    1.  Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024            : Increased the time limit for filing a request for examination to 60 months
    2.  Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL): Prevents biopiracy and wrongful patents through analog methods
    3.  National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, 2016: Does not acknowledge the Doha Development Agenda or TRIPS Agreement
    4.  Compulsory Licensing                        : A flexibility under the TRIPS agreement

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Compulsory licensing is indeed a flexibility provided under the TRIPS Agreement.  Let's analyze the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 1:** The Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, *reduced*, not increased, the time limit for filing a request for examination.

* **Pair 2:** TKDL uses *digital* methods to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents.

* **Pair 3:** The 2016 IPR Policy explicitly *reiterates* India's commitment to the Doha Development Agenda and the TRIPS Agreement.


**8.  With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                         Detail
    1.  Establishment Year                         : 2007
    2.  Composition                                 : Chairperson and 5 Members
    3.  Functions                                  : Includes regulating mergers and acquisitions
    4.  Governing Act                               : Competition Act, 2003


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The CCI's functions do include preventing practices that adversely affect competition and protecting consumer interests, which inherently involves regulating mergers and acquisitions.  The other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The CCI was established in 2009, not 2007.

* **Pair 2:** The CCI comprises a Chairperson and 6 Members, not 5.

* **Pair 4:** The CCI is established under the Competition Act, 2002, not 2003.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                      Characteristic/Function
1. PACS                                        Regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
2. DCCBs                                       Refinanced by NABARD
3.  National Cooperative Database (NCD)     Provides information on the agricultural sector

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. DCCBs (District Central Cooperative Banks) are indeed refinanced by NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development).  This is a crucial aspect of the cooperative credit structure in India, where DCCBs play a vital role in channeling funds to the primary level agricultural credit societies (PACS).

Statement 1 is incorrect because PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Societies) are *not* regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. They are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  While they receive funds from DCCBs, their regulatory oversight is distinct from that of banks.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Cooperative Database (NCD) provides comprehensive information about the *cooperative sector* as a whole, not just the agricultural sector. While agriculture is a significant component of cooperative activity, the NCD encompasses a broader range of cooperative societies and their operations.  The inclusion of agriculture as a sole focus in the pair is a deliberate distractor designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the NCD's scope.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Activity/Function
1. NUCFDC                                       Regulates Housing Finance Companies
2. RBI                                           Supervises managerial matters of UCBs
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC)   Operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The NUCFDC (National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited) acts as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs). This is a key function aimed at improving the governance and financial stability of UCBs.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NUCFDC does *not* regulate Housing Finance Companies. That function is primarily the responsibility of the National Housing Bank (NHB).  This incorrect pairing is intended to test the candidate's knowledge of the specific regulatory bodies responsible for different financial institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI regulates the banking functions of UCBs, it does *not* supervise their managerial and administrative matters.  That responsibility rests with the State/Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  This incorrect pairing highlights the dual regulatory framework for UCBs and the division of responsibilities between the RBI and the cooperative societies' regulatory bodies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Initiative                                   Primary Focus/Objective
1. Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020     Allows UCBs to lend money for agricultural purposes
2. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework   Addresses the financial health of UCBs
3.  Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs     Segregates NBFCs based on their size and perceived level of riskiness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework is explicitly designed to address the financial health of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) with greater precision and flexibility.  Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) indeed segregates NBFCs into different tiers based on size, activity, and risk assessment, allowing for tailored regulatory requirements.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, primarily focuses on giving the RBI more powers to supersede the boards of cooperative banks, enhancing regulatory control.  It does not directly address the lending activities of UCBs for agricultural purposes; that's a separate aspect of their operations.  The inclusion of this seemingly plausible but incorrect statement serves as a strong distractor.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                 Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendras      To be operated by PACS
2.  Jute I-CARE Project                           Aims at mechanization in jute farming
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)         To generate investment by monetising existing government assets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendras are indeed intended to be operated by PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Societies), expanding their roles beyond credit services. The Jute I-CARE Project (Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) explicitly aims to mechanize jute farming and improve retting processes.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is correctly described as an initiative to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and their specific objectives.  There are no distractors here; all pairs are accurately matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Survey/Report                                 Primary Focus/Data Source
1. NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS)  Measures financial inclusion based on data collected through NAFIS.
2.  Financial Stability Report (FSR)             Highlights achievements in Non-Performing Assets (NPA)
3.  Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report     Analyzes Public-Private Partnership (PPP) regulatory landscapes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) directly uses its collected data to measure financial inclusion in rural areas.  The RBI's biannual Financial Stability Report (FSR) does indeed highlight achievements (and challenges) related to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report focuses on analyzing the regulatory landscapes of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of important surveys and reports in the financial and infrastructure sectors and their respective foci.  The straightforward nature of the correct pairings makes this a question of factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Characteristic/Association
1.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Regulated as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND)
2.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs   :  Effective from April 1, 2026
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Ombudsman (ORBIOs)   : Handles complaints related to only Housing Finance Companies
4.  Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs) :  Must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **NUCFDC:**  The statement is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I. Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which accurately describes NUCFDC's function.

2. **PCA framework for UCBs:** The statement is incorrect. The PCA framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) is effective from April 1, 2025, not 2026.  This detail is crucial for understanding the timeline of RBI's regulatory actions concerning UCBs.

3. **RBI Ombudsman (ORBIOs):** This statement is incorrect.  The RBI Ombudsman handles complaints related to various financial entities, not solely Housing Finance Companies. The scope of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction is much broader, encompassing numerous types of financial institutions and their interactions with customers.

4. **SROs for REs:** This statement is incorrect.  The Omnibus Framework specifies that an SRO must be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  The "for-profit" designation is a significant deviation from the actual requirement.


The incorrect information in each pair highlights the importance of precise knowledge of regulatory frameworks and financial institutions in India.  A superficial understanding could easily lead to incorrect matches.  The question tests not only factual recall but also the ability to critically evaluate the accuracy of statements concerning the regulatory environment.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                 Key Provision/Feature
1.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                         :  ARCs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
2.  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 :  Requires completion of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) within 90 days
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) (Asset Reconstruction Companies) Directions, 2024 :  ARCs are required to resolve assets within a maximum of 5 years
4.  Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA)                : Decisions are binding on all lenders if agreed upon by lenders representing 50% by value of outstanding credit

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Once again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests detailed knowledge of Indian financial regulations.

1. **SARFAESI Act, 2002:**  Incorrect.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, mandates that ARCs are registered and regulated by the RBI, not SEBI.  This highlights the distinct roles of RBI and SEBI in regulating financial institutions in India.

2. **IBC, 2016:** Incorrect. The IBC mandates completion of CIRP within 180 days, extendable to a maximum of 330 days, not 90 days. This emphasizes the time-bound nature of the insolvency resolution process but also the potential for extensions under specific circumstances.

3. **RBI (Asset Reconstruction Companies) Directions, 2024:** Incorrect.  The Directions stipulate that ARCs must resolve assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years. This highlights the long-term nature of asset resolution and the time required to effectively address Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).

4. **Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA):** Incorrect.  According to the RBI's framework, decisions are binding if agreed upon by lenders representing 75% by value and 60% by number, not 50% by value.  This underscores the importance of consensus-building among lenders in managing stressed assets.


The inaccuracies in all pairs underscore the need for precise knowledge of the legal and regulatory frameworks governing financial institutions and asset resolution in India.  The options are designed to test detailed understanding and to differentiate candidates with superficial knowledge from those with a deeper grasp of the subject matter.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Entity                           Regulatory Body
1.  Housing Finance Companies                        :  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
2.  Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Company     :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  Insurance companies                             :  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)
4.  Chit Fund Companies                            :  Ministry of Corporate Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests the understanding of the regulatory landscape for different financial institutions in India.

1. **Housing Finance Companies:** Incorrect. Housing Finance Companies are regulated by the National Housing Bank (NHB), not SEBI. This highlights the specialized regulatory bodies for different segments of the financial sector.

2. **Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Company:** Incorrect.  These entities are regulated by SEBI, not RBI.  This emphasizes the role of SEBI in overseeing market intermediaries.

3. **Insurance companies:** Correct.  Insurance companies are appropriately regulated by the IRDAI.  This highlights the importance of specialized regulation for the insurance sector.

4. **Chit Fund Companies:** Correct. Chit fund companies are regulated by the respective state governments, often through specific state-level legislation or departments.  The Ministry of Corporate Affairs also plays a role in their overall regulation.


The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing various financial institutions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options (pairs 1 and 2) makes the question challenging and helps to distinguish candidates with a thorough understanding from those with only a partial knowledge of the subject.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                         Definition/Characteristic
1.  Wilful Default                               : Default with an outstanding amount below ₹25 lakh
2.  Large Defaulter                              : Default where no suit has been filed
3.  Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) : Available for defaults of less than ₹10 lakh
4.  Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC)         : Primarily buys Performing Assets from banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of key terms and concepts related to financial distress and resolution.

1. **Wilful Default:** Incorrect.  A wilful default involves an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above.  The definition highlights the severity of wilful defaults and their implications.

2. **Large Defaulter:** Incorrect. A large defaulter is defined by an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above, and where a suit has been filed or the account is classified as doubtful or a loss. The definition emphasizes the seriousness of large defaults and the legal actions involved.

3. **PPIRP:** Incorrect. PPIRP is available for defaults of at least ₹10 lakh. The definition clarifies the threshold for accessing this resolution mechanism.

4. **ARC:** Incorrect. ARCs primarily buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), not performing assets, from banks and financial institutions.  The definition emphasizes the core function of ARCs in resolving financial distress.


The incorrect information in all pairs emphasizes the need for precise understanding of financial terminology. The question tests detailed knowledge and serves as a good discriminator between candidates with varying levels of expertise.  The plausible distractors make this a challenging question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Crop Production Trend (2011-12 to 2022-23)          Percentage Change
    1. Crop Production                                     : Increased from 62.4% to 54.3%
    2. Forestry Production                                 : Decreased steadily
    3. Livestock and Fishing Production                  : Remained constant


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that crop production declined from 62.4% to 54.3% between 2011-12 and 2022-23.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  The text explicitly mentions that forestry production *increased* steadily during this period, making pair 2 incorrect as well.  Finally, the text indicates that livestock and fishing production increased steadily, contradicting pair 3. Consequently, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of percentage changes in agricultural sub-sectors over a specified period.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between increasing and decreasing trends and to avoid common misconceptions regarding agricultural growth patterns in India.  The correct answer highlights the importance of precise data interpretation in analyzing economic trends.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme                                     Primary Focus
    1. National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) :  Price support for oilseed farmers
    2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)             : Expanding oil palm cultivation in North Eastern States
    3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)      : Seed improvement and distribution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NFSM-OS&OP indeed focuses on seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer, not primarily price support.  PM-AASHA is the scheme that ensures MSP through price support and deficiency payment.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The NMEO-OP aims to expand oil palm cultivation, especially in the Northeast and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, making pair 2 correct. Pair 3 is incorrect as the primary focus of the PM-AASHA is price support, not seed improvement.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of specific government schemes aimed at improving oilseed production and their respective objectives.  The distractors test the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding schemes and their core functions, demonstrating an understanding of policy implementation in the agricultural sector. The correct answer highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of different government initiatives related to agricultural development.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Edible Oil Production Challenges                     Description
    1. Cultivation challenges                               :  Concentrated production in specific states
    2. Crop-specific concentrations                        :  Nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation is rainfed
    3.  High Logistics Costs                               :  India's per capita finished steel consumption is low


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched as the text mentions that the production of specific oilseeds is concentrated in certain states. Pair 2 is also correctly matched; the text notes that nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation is rainfed. Pair 3 is incorrect because it refers to a challenge in the steel sector, not edible oil production.  The question tests the candidate's ability to identify specific challenges in edible oil production and link them to their accurate descriptions.  The distractor (pair 3) is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the context and to avoid confusion with related sectors.  The correct answer underscores the importance of understanding the constraints affecting the domestic edible oil sector.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Mineral Type                                      Location/Feature
    1. Polymetallic nodules                               : Formed around hydrothermal vents
    2. Seafloor massive sulphides                         : Found on the seabed, containing manganese and iron
    3. Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts                 : Form on seamounts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Polymetallic nodules are described in the text as small, potato-shaped lumps found on the seabed, not formed around hydrothermal vents.  Seafloor massive sulphides are indeed formed around hydrothermal vents, making pair 2 incorrect.  Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts are correctly described as crust-like deposits forming on seamounts, making pair 3 correct. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of different types of deep-sea minerals and their characteristics. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar mineral types and their locations or formation processes. The correct answer emphasizes the importance of understanding the geological aspects of deep-sea mining.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Steel Sector Challenge                                 Description
    1. Lack of Raw Material                               : High logistics costs
    2. Low per capita consumption                        : India's per capita finished steel consumption is low in 2023-24
    3. Extremely energy-intensive industry                :  Steel is the largest carbon-emitting manufacturing sector globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The text states that India largely relies on costly imports of coking coal, indicating a lack of raw materials, not high logistics costs. Pair 2 is correctly matched; the text provides the data on India's low per capita steel consumption compared to global averages.  Pair 3 is also correctly matched; the text correctly identifies the steel industry as a major carbon emitter globally. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the challenges faced by India's steel sector. The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between various challenges and avoid confusing them with other related issues. The correct answer emphasizes the importance of understanding the complexities of the steel industry's economic and environmental impacts.

The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. The National Monetisation Pipeline seeks to generate investment by monetising existing government assets. Option (a) is incorrect; the Private Investment Unit handles policy, not the Appraisal Committee. Option (c) is incorrect; the Appraisal Committee evaluates projects, not the National Monetisation Pipeline. Option (d) is incorrect; the National Monetisation Pipeline focuses on asset monetization, not the Private Investment Unit. Only option (b) correctly identifies the agency responsible for investment generation through asset monetization.  This understanding is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of PPP models in infrastructure development in India.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Logistics Sector Initiative/Policy          Specific Detail
1. National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022     :   Dedicated Freight Corridors
2.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)      :   $6.2 Billion investment outlay
3. Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index :  Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's logistics sector is undergoing significant reforms. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 aims to improve efficiency across the sector, though Dedicated Freight Corridors are a separate initiative to enhance rail freight.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) have a planned investment outlay of $6.2 billion.  The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index assesses state-level logistics performance, unrelated to RELOS. Option (a) is incorrect because the NLP is not directly associated with Dedicated Freight Corridors. Option (b) is correct as it accurately matches the MMLPs with their investment outlay. Option (d) is incorrect because the LEADS index is not related to RELOS.  Only option (c) correctly matches two pairs, highlighting key initiatives in the Indian logistics sector.  Understanding these policies and initiatives is crucial for analyzing the progress and challenges in improving India's logistics efficiency.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Sector Issue/Initiative          Specific Detail
1.  Technological Issues in Agriculture        :   47% mechanization of agricultural activities
2.  Inadequate Irrigation Infrastructure      :   51% rainfed agriculture in net sown area
3.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)         :   Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian agricultural sector faces various challenges.  The low level of mechanization (47%) and the high percentage of rainfed agriculture (51%) are significant technological and infrastructural issues. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a data platform, not related to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which recommends Minimum Support Prices (MSPs). Option (b) is incorrect; while low mechanization is a correct pairing, other pairs are not. Option (c) is incorrect as only the irrigation infrastructure issue is correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because ADeX is not linked to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the challenges of technology and irrigation in Indian agriculture. This understanding is critical for developing effective policies to improve agricultural productivity and farmer livelihoods.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Taxation Policy/Initiative                 Specific Detail
1.  Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)          :   Resolves transfer pricing disputes
2.  Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)        :   Prevents transfer pricing disputes
3.  OECD Global Minimum Tax                 :   15% minimum effective rate on corporate profits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

International taxation involves various mechanisms to address double taxation and profit shifting. The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism to resolve transfer pricing disputes arising from tax treaties. Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) aim to prevent such disputes by agreeing on transfer pricing methodologies in advance. The OECD Global Minimum Tax sets a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on corporate profits to curb profit shifting. All three pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the key initiatives in international tax cooperation.  Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for analyzing the effectiveness of global efforts to ensure fair and equitable taxation of multinational corporations.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Port/Port Initiative                      Specific Detail
1. Mormugao Port Authority                  :   World's largest container port
2. Vadhvan Port                               :   India's 13th major port
3.  Harit Shrey scheme                        :   Incentivizes ships with favourable ESI scores

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's port sector is undergoing significant development.  Vadhavan Port is being established as India's 13th major port. The Harit Shrey scheme, introduced by Mormugao Port, incentivizes ships with favorable Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores, promoting green shipping.  Mormugao Port is not the world's largest container port.  Option (a) is incorrect; Vadhvan Port's designation is correct, but Mormugao's claim about being the world's largest is not. Option (c) is incorrect; only one pair being correct is not accurate. Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly pairs Vadhvan Port with the Harit Shrey scheme. Only option (d) correctly matches two pairs.  Understanding these developments is crucial for analyzing the growth and environmental sustainability aspects of India's port sector.



**1. With reference to Agricultural Finance in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. AIF (Agriculture Infrastructure Fund)                 :   Loans up to ₹50 Lakh with 3% interest subvention
2. PM KUSUM Component-A                              :   Convergence with AIF for farmer groups
3. NABARD Sanrakshan                                  :   Credit guarantee coverage for FPOs under AIF
4.  CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises): Credit guarantee coverage for loans up to ₹2 Crores under AIF

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the key features of the schemes.  NABARD Sanrakshan indeed extends AIF credit guarantee coverage to Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). Similarly, the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) provides credit guarantee coverage for loans up to ₹2 Crores under the AIF scheme.

Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. While AIF does offer interest subvention, the loan amount is not capped at ₹50 Lakh; it extends to much higher amounts, and the upper limit varies.

Option (b) is incorrect because while statement 2 is correct (PM KUSUM Component-A does allow convergence with AIF), statement 1 is incorrect as explained above.

Option (d) is incorrect as statement 1 is false.


**2. With reference to India's Agritech Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                          Core Function/Objective
1. FASAL Project                                      :   Improvement in yield estimation using space technology
2. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And Geoinformatics) :  Early forecasts of crop output
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)                   :   Data exchange platform for farmer services, holding data on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the core functions. The FASAL project focuses on providing early forecasts of crop output using space, agro-meteorology, and land-based observations.  ADeX is indeed a data exchange platform for farmer services, holding the specified datasets.

Option (a) is incorrect because pair 2 is mismatched. KISAN is focused on crop insurance and yield estimation using space technology, not early crop output forecasting.  That is the primary function of FASAL.

Option (b) is incorrect because statement 1 is correct, but statement 2 is incorrect as explained above.

Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is false.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Scheme                                       Key Characteristic
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                           :   Covers only Kharif crops
2. India's Agriculture Export Policy (2018)              :   Achieved its target of $60 billion agricultural exports by 2022
3.  Geographical Indications Act 1999                     :   Guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge related to agricultural products

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, does guarantee collective rights over traditional knowledge, including that related to agricultural products.

Statement 1 is incorrect because MSP covers both Kharif and Rabi crops, along with some commercial crops.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's Agriculture Export Policy (2018) aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, but this target was not met.


**4. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's Infrastructure Development, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Organization                             Role/Function
1.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan                 :   Driven by 7 engines, uses BISAG-N's Digital Master Planning tool
2. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee      :   Evaluates state-level PPP projects
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)               :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore investment over four years (FY22-FY25)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is indeed driven by seven engines and utilizes the BISAG-N's Digital Master Planning tool. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) correctly targets the specified investment amount over the given period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not state-level ones.


**5. With reference to the Indian Financial Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Scheme                                        Characteristic/Function
1.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)                 :   Published bi-annually by RBI
2. Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) :   Covers only commercial banks and NBFCs with assets above ₹100 crore
3.  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) under PCA           :   Monitored based on Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  UCBs under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) are indeed monitored based on Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published annually, not bi-annually.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While RB-IOS covers commercial banks and some NBFCs, its coverage is broader than described, including other entities like Regional Rural Banks and certain Urban Cooperative Banks.


**6. With reference to  India's Rural Economy and the FMCG sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Initiative                                   Description/Feature
1. Green Shoots                                          :   Signs of economic growth after a downturn, observed in India's rural economy impacting FMCG
2.  ISI Mark                                             :   Mandatory for all FMCG products in India
3.  Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Sector           :   Characterized by high turnover consumer packaged goods with short consumption cycles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Green shoots accurately describe signs of economic recovery, and the description of the FMCG sector is also accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ISI mark is mandatory for *some* FMCG products, it's not mandatory for *all* of them.  The government mandates it on a product-by-product basis through Quality Control Orders.


**7. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Agricultural Trade, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Policy                                      Key Aspect
1. Marrakesh Agreement                                    :   Replaced the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with the WTO
2. Public Stockholding (PSH) Policy                      :   Allows governments to procure crops at MSP without breaching de minimis limits
3.  De Minimis limits                                      :   Calculated using the reference price for 1986-88 and are the same for both developed and developing countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Marrakesh Agreement did lead to the formation of the WTO, replacing GATT.  The PSH policy allows government procurement at MSP but the issue of de minimis limits remains a point of contention in the WTO.

Statement 3 is incorrect. De minimis limits are different for developed and developing countries (10% for developing and 5% for developed).  The reference price used for calculation is also a point of contention.


**8. With reference to India's Digital Agriculture Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                           Key Component/Feature
1.  Digital Agriculture Mission                         :   Built on Agri Stack and Krishi Decision Support System (DSS)
2.  Agri Stack                                          :   Includes Farmers' Registry, Geo-referenced village maps, and Crop Sown Registry
3.  Krishi Decision Support System (DSS)                :   Utilizes data solely from the Indian Meteorological Department


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Digital Agriculture Mission is indeed built on the two pillars of Agri Stack and Krishi DSS. Agri Stack also accurately includes the mentioned components.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Krishi DSS uses meteorological data, it integrates data from various sources, including remote sensing data from ISRO.  It's not solely reliant on the Indian Meteorological Department.


**1. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following pairs:**

    Parameter                                  Value/Feature
    1.  FI-Index value in March 2024          :  60.1
    2.  Frequency of FI-Index publication     :  Annually in July
    3.  Weight assigned to 'Usage' parameter :  35%
    4.  Minimum value of the FI-Index         :  0 (complete exclusion)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The FI-Index value in March 2024 was 64.2, not 60.1 (pair 1 is incorrect). The FI-Index is indeed published annually in July (pair 2 is correct). The weight assigned to the 'Usage' parameter is 45%, not 35% (pair 3 is incorrect).  The minimum value of the index, representing complete exclusion, is indeed 0 (pair 4 is correct).  Therefore, only pair 2 is accurately matched.  The other options incorrectly include pairs with false information, testing the candidate's ability to identify accurate data amidst plausible distractors.  Understanding the core components of the FI-Index, its publication schedule, and the weighting of its parameters is crucial for comprehending India's financial inclusion policies.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following pairs:**

    Entity Covered                               Asset Size/Deposit Size
    1.  Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks :  ₹50 crore and above
    2.  All Non-Banking Financial Companies (except Housing Finance Companies)  :  ₹25 lakh and above
    3.  Commercial Banks                             :  No asset size/deposit size criteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above are covered under the RB-IOS.  All Non-Banking Financial Companies (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above, not ₹25 lakh and above, are covered (pair 2 is incorrect). Commercial banks are covered under the scheme but there is no specified asset or deposit size criteria for their inclusion (pair 3 is incorrect). Option (a) correctly identifies only the accurate pairing. The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely incorrect information, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the RB-IOS coverage. A thorough grasp of the regulatory framework governing financial institutions in India is essential for correct identification.



**3. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                              Feature
    1.  Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank :  Established in 1987
    2. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) loan category 'Tarun' : Loan amount up to ₹10 lakh
    3.  RBI’s Malegam Committee                   :  Recommended framework to regulate NBFC-MFIs in 2005


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pair 2 is correctly matched. SEWA Bank was established in 1974, not 1987 (pair 1 is incorrect). The 'Tarun' category under PMMY indeed covers loans above ₹5 lakh and up to ₹10 lakh (pair 2 is correct). The RBI's Malegam Committee submitted its recommendations in 2010, not 2005 (pair 3 is incorrect). Option (b) accurately identifies the only correct pairing.  The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely wrong details, testing the candidate's knowledge of key microfinance initiatives and their timelines.  Understanding the history and regulatory aspects of India's microfinance sector is critical for answering this question correctly.


**4. With reference to the Agri-Tech sector in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                         Feature/Focus
    1.  FASAL Project                               :  Improving yield estimation
    2.  AI4AI initiative                             : Launched by World Economic Forum
    3.  KISAN (Crop Insurance)                       :  Started in 2005


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 2 and 1 are correctly matched.  The FASAL project focuses on providing early forecasts of crop output, not improving yield estimation (pair 1 is incorrect, though related). The AI4AI initiative is indeed launched by the World Economic Forum (pair 2 is correct). KISAN is a crop insurance scheme using space technology, but it was not started in 2005; FASAL was (pair 3 is incorrect). Option (c) accurately identifies the correct pairings.  The incorrect options test the candidate's knowledge of specific agri-tech initiatives and their objectives.  A clear understanding of India's efforts to adopt agricultural technology is crucial for a correct response.


**5. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    1.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                          :  Resolving stressed assets above ₹500 crore
    2.  IBC, 2016                                     :  Reorganization and insolvency resolution
    3.  National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited :  Allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral upon default, not resolving stressed assets above ₹500 crore (pair 1 is incorrect). The IBC, 2016, indeed deals with the reorganization and insolvency resolution of various entities (pair 2 is correct). The National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited aims to resolve stressed assets, but the SARFAESI Act deals with the process of taking possession of collateral (pair 3 is correct). Option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings. The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely incorrect information, testing the candidate’s understanding of legal frameworks and mechanisms used to address NPAs. A comprehensive knowledge of India’s NPA management strategies is essential for accurate identification.


**6. With reference to  Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Body/Initiative                                 Role/Function
    1.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee:  Monetising existing government assets
    2.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)       :  Evaluating central sector PPP projects
    3.  Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs: Policy-level matters concerning PPPs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not monetising government assets (pair 1 is incorrect). The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising government assets, not evaluating projects (pair 2 is incorrect). The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is indeed responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs (pair 3 is correct). Option (b) accurately identifies the only correct pairing. The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely incorrect information, testing the candidate’s knowledge of the institutional framework governing PPPs in India.  A clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different bodies involved in PPPs is needed for accurate selection.


**7. With reference to  the Indian Banking Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Initiative                                     Description/Feature
    1.  PCA (Prompt Corrective Action)                 :  Exit is triggered if risk thresholds are breached for four consecutive quarters
    2.  Co-lending                                    :  Banks can co-lend with any NBFC, irrespective of promoter group affiliation
    3.  Wilful Defaulter                              :  Outstanding amount of ₹10 lakh and above


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pair 1 is correctly matched.  In PCA, exit and withdrawal of restrictions are indeed triggered if there are no breaches in risk thresholds for four consecutive quarters (pair 1 is correct).  Co-lending arrangements have restrictions, banks cannot co-lend with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group (pair 2 is incorrect). A wilful defaulter is defined by an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above, not ₹10 lakh (pair 3 is incorrect). Option (a) accurately identifies the only correct pairing. The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely incorrect information, testing the candidate’s knowledge of banking regulations and terminology.  A detailed understanding of banking sector regulations and risk management frameworks is needed for accurate selection.


**8. With reference to the  Indian Economy, consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator/Scheme                                     Value/Feature
    1.  India's Gross NPA ratio at March-end 2024      : 2.8%
    2.  Minimum wage in India                           :  Specified in the Minimum Wages Act, 1948

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pair 1 is correctly matched.  India's Gross NPA ratio at March-end 2024 was indeed 2.8% (pair 1 is correct). The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, provides guidelines but does not specify a minimum wage (pair 2 is incorrect). The annual income threshold for microfinance loans is ₹3,00,000, not ₹1,00,000 (pair 3 is incorrect). Option (a) correctly identifies the only accurate pairing. The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely incorrect data, testing the candidate’s knowledge of key economic indicators and policy details. A comprehensive understanding of India's economic situation and related policies is needed to select the correct option.

    2.  SECI                                           :  A Miniratna Category-II CPSE
    3.  GIFT IFSC Expert Committee Report             :  Focuses on developing GIFT IFSC as a 'Global Finance and Accounting Hub'


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because all three pairs are correctly matched. IREDA was indeed established in 1987 as a Non-Banking Financial Institution (pair 1 is correct). SECI is a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and holds Miniratna Category-I status (pair 2 is correct). The GIFT IFSC Expert Committee report aimed to develop GIFT IFSC as a 'Global Finance and Accounting Hub' (pair 3 is correct). Option (d) accurately identifies all correct pairings.  The incorrect options serve as distractors, testing the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of organizations and initiatives related to renewable energy and financial services in India. A detailed understanding of these sectors is necessary for correct identification.

    2.  Rashtriya Gokul Mission                         :  To control and eradicate FMD and Brucellosis
    3.  Pandemic Fund Project                           :  Funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Unified Genomic Chips ('Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip') were indeed developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (pair 1 is correct). The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims at the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, not controlling FMD and Brucellosis (pair 2 is incorrect, though related). The Pandemic Fund Project is indeed funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund (pair 3 is correct). Option (b) accurately identifies the correct pairings. The incorrect options include pairs with either partially or completely incorrect information, testing the candidate’s understanding of initiatives aimed at improving India’s livestock sector.  A thorough grasp of these programs and their objectives is needed for accurate selection.


**1. With reference to India's Agricultural Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                 :  Targets 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025
    2. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) : Uses RISAT-1A satellite data for yield estimation
    3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)         :  Integrates farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data
    4. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Employs AI, remote sensing, and GIS for decision-making


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana explicitly aims for one million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025 as a key component of its strategy to boost the fisheries sector. KISAN leverages space technology, specifically data from the RISAT-1A satellite, for improved yield estimation.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform is designed to integrate and provide access to crucial datasets including farmer identity, geo-tagged farm location, and crops sown, creating a comprehensive agricultural database. Finally, the Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and geographic information systems to facilitate informed decision-making within the agricultural sector.  There are no inaccuracies or mismatches in the provided pairs.


**2. With reference to India's Infrastructure Development, consider the following pairs:**

    Program/Initiative                         Specific Detail
    1. Bharatmala Pariyojana                  :  Construction of 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases.
    2. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC)       :  Aimed at increasing rail freight traffic share from 27% (2019) to 45% (2030).
    3. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)      :  Planned investment outlay of $6.2 Billion for 35 parks.
    4. Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index :  Measures the challenges and opportunities faced in trade logistics.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Bharatmala Pariyojana's core objective is indeed the construction of approximately 65,000 km of national highways across two phases. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project aims to significantly enhance the share of rail freight traffic in India's logistics network, targeting an increase from 27% in 2019 to 45% by 2030.  The planned investment for the Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) is accurately stated as $6.2 billion for the development of 35 such parks across the country. However, the LEADS index is not directly matched with the description. The LEADS index measures logistics performance across states within India, not global trade logistics. Therefore, option (c) is the most accurate.


**3. With reference to India's Steel Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Challenge                                 Specific Impact/Feature
    1. Lack of Coking Coal                      :  High reliance on costly imports from Australia
    2. Low Per Capita Steel Consumption        :  India's consumption was 97.7 kg in 2023-24, against the world average of 219.3 kg
    3. Carbon Tax Imposition by EU             : Threatens major iron and steel exports to the European Union.
    4.  High Logistics Costs                    : Contributes to the cyclical nature of steel demand.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs (1, 2, and 3) accurately represent challenges facing India's steel sector. India's significant reliance on coking coal imports, particularly from Australia due to domestic shortages, drives up costs.  The low per capita steel consumption in India compared to global averages reflects the relatively lower level of industrialization and infrastructure development compared to many other countries.  The carbon tax imposed by the EU directly impacts India's steel exports to this significant market. However, the connection between high logistics costs and the cyclical nature of steel demand is less direct. While high logistics costs are a challenge, attributing the cyclical nature of demand solely to them is an oversimplification. Other factors, such as global economic conditions and investment cycles, also play a significant role in the cyclical patterns of steel demand. Therefore, option (c) is the most accurate.


**4. With reference to India's Silk Production, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                      Contribution to Total Silk Production
    1. Karnataka                               :  Around 32%
    2. Andhra Pradesh                          : Second highest contributor after Karnataka
    3. Tamil Nadu                               :  Produces all varieties of Mulberry, Eri, Tasar and Muga silks
    4.  West Bengal                             : Contributes significantly to Muga silk production


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) Only three
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two pairs are correctly matched. Karnataka's contribution to India's total silk production is accurately stated as approximately 32%. Andhra Pradesh is correctly identified as the second-largest contributor after Karnataka.  However, the statement that Tamil Nadu produces all varieties of silk is incorrect;  while Tamil Nadu is a significant silk-producing state, it doesn't produce *all* varieties. Similarly, while West Bengal is known for Muga silk,  the statement that it contributes *significantly* is a matter of degree and is not stated as a fact in the source material.  Therefore, only two pairs are definitively and accurately matched.


**5. With reference to India's Deep Sea Mining, consider the following pairs:**

    Mineral                                     Location/Feature
    1. Polymetallic Nodules                     : Found on the seabed, containing manganese and iron
    2. Seafloor Massive Sulphides                : Formed around hydrothermal vents, containing copper, gold, and zinc
    3. Cobalt-rich Ferromanganese Crusts        : Found on seamounts, containing cobalt
    4. Phosphorite                               : Found in Eastern & Western continental margins of India's EEZ


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Polymetallic nodules are accurately described as potato-shaped mineral lumps found on the seafloor, rich in manganese and iron. Seafloor massive sulphides are correctly identified as deposits formed near hydrothermal vents, containing valuable metals like copper, gold, and zinc.  Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts are accurately described as crust-like formations on seamounts, rich in cobalt.  The mention of phosphorite deposits in the Eastern and Western continental margins of India's EEZ is also correct. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization                  Key Feature/Mandate
1. Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)     :   Assists Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to use trade for growth
2.  World Trade Organization (WTO)           :   Established by the Marrakesh Agreement
3.  International Monetary Fund (IMF)        :   Provides loans for specific development projects
4.  Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA): Part of the World Bank Group, offering guarantees for private sector projects.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership specifically designed to help Least Developed Countries (LDCs) leverage trade as a driver of economic growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  This directly aligns with pair 1.  The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, established the World Trade Organization (WTO), making pair 2 correct.  The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, provides guarantees to mitigate political and commercial risks in private sector projects, aligning with pair 4.  However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) does *not* provide loans for specific projects; its lending focuses on macroeconomic stability and crisis response, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indian Act/Fund                                      Characteristic
1. Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                            :   Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
2. Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)              :   Generated funds through a levy on telecom licensees
3.  Telecommunications Act, 2023                        :   Established the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
4.  Indian Telegraph Act, 1885                           :   Preceded the Telecommunications Act, 2023



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) was created by the Telecommunications Act, 2023, specifically to replace the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), making pair 1 correct. The USOF, established under the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, was indeed funded by a levy on telecom licensees' adjusted gross revenue, making pair 2 correct. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, chronologically preceded the Telecommunications Act, 2023, making pair 4 correct.  However, the Telecommunications Act, 2023, *established* the DBN, not the USOF; the USOF existed previously under the older Act. Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Tax-Related Agreement/Initiative                     Description
1. OECD Global Minimum Tax                               :  Mandates a minimum 15% tax rate on corporate profits for Multinational Enterprises (MNEs)
2. OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS                 : Aims to prevent tax avoidance by multinational enterprises through a two-pillar approach
3.  Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS :  Focuses solely on preventing tax avoidance through transfer pricing adjustments
4. UN Global Tax Treaty                                  :  Supported by developing countries, opposed by many industrialized nations.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The OECD Global Minimum Tax indeed aims to establish a 15% minimum effective tax rate on corporate profits of multinational enterprises (MNEs), making pair 1 correct. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) is a comprehensive initiative employing a two-pillar approach to combat tax avoidance by MNEs, accurately described in pair 2. The UN Global Tax Treaty has garnered support from developing nations while facing opposition from several developed countries, making pair 4 correct. However, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS is broader than just transfer pricing adjustments; it addresses various aspects of tax avoidance by multinational enterprises, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indian Legislation/Policy                            Purpose/Feature
1.  Duty Drawback                                        :  Rebates customs duty on imported materials used in export goods
2.  Windfall Tax                                          :  Tax imposed on industries with exceptionally high profits due to favourable market conditions
3.  Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001: Primarily focused on protecting intellectual property rights related to plant varieties
4.  The Biological Diversity Act, 2002                   :  Doesn't address issues related to fair and equitable benefit-sharing of genetic resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Duty Drawback scheme, under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, does indeed rebate customs duties paid on imported or excisable materials used in the manufacture of export goods, making pair 1 correct.  A windfall tax is levied on industries experiencing unusually high profits due to favorable economic circumstances, accurately described in pair 2. However, the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, goes beyond just intellectual property; it also addresses farmers' rights and the conservation of plant genetic resources, making pair 3 incorrect.  The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, explicitly aims for fair and equitable benefit-sharing from the utilization of genetic resources, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Initiative                                        Characteristic
1. Global Innovation Index (GII)                           :  Ranks countries based on innovation capabilities, including social entrepreneurship
2. International Intellectual Property (IP) Index           :  Published by the US Chamber of Commerce
3.  Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index                        :  Replaced the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings
4.  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge:  Addresses the interface between intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Innovation Index (GII) comprehensively assesses countries' innovation capabilities across various factors, including the role of social entrepreneurship, making pair 1 correct. The International Intellectual Property (IP) Index is indeed published by the US Chamber of Commerce, aligning with pair 2. The Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index was introduced by the World Bank to replace its Ease of Doing Business rankings, making pair 3 correct.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge directly addresses the interplay between intellectual property rights, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    WTO Agreement/Initiative                             Feature
1. Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies                        :  Aims to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that deplete fish stocks
2. TRIPS Agreement                                       :  Sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection
3.  Marrakesh Agreement                                  :  Established the World Trade Organization (WTO)
4.  Public Stockholding (PSH) Policy                        :  Allows governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies focuses on curbing harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of global fish stocks, making pair 1 correct. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) establishes minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights among WTO members, making pair 2 correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), making pair 3 correct. The Public Stockholding (PSH) policy enables governments to procure agricultural products from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSP), store them, and distribute them to the needy, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Insurance Sector Related Entity/Concept             Description
1. IRDAI                                                 :  Regulates and develops the insurance sector in India
2.  Insurance Penetration                               :  Ratio of insurance premiums to GDP
3.  D-SIIs (Domestic Systemically Important Insurers)   :  Not subject to additional regulatory measures
4.  'Insurance for All' by 2047                           :  A target set by the Ministry of Finance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) is the regulatory body responsible for overseeing and developing the insurance sector in India, making pair 1 correct. Insurance penetration is indeed calculated as the ratio of total insurance premiums to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), making pair 2 correct. The 'Insurance for All' by 2047 initiative is a goal set by the IRDAI, not the Ministry of Finance, making pair 4 correct. However, Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) are indeed subject to additional regulatory measures due to their systemic importance, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    World Bank Related Initiative/Concept                  Description
1. World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP)          :  Aims to increase annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030
2.  Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings                : Replaced by the Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index
3.  World Bank Guarantees                                :  Primarily provided to private lenders for small-scale projects
4.  Business Reform Action Plan rankings                   : Does not incorporate indicators tracked by the B-Ready Index


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) aims to significantly increase the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance, setting a target of $20 billion by 2030, making pair 1 correct. The Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings were indeed discontinued and replaced by the Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, making pair 2 correct.  However, World Bank guarantees are typically provided for large-scale infrastructure projects that require substantial financing and face significant risks, not small-scale projects, making pair 3 incorrect. The 2024 Business Reform Action Plan rankings do incorporate some indicators tracked by the B-Ready index, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**1. With reference to International Financial Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                 Feature
    1. International Monetary Fund (IMF)       :   Provides loans for specific development projects
    2. World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) : Consolidates guarantee products from across WBG institutions at MIGA
    3. Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) : Offers long-term financing to build resilience to external shocks
    4.  Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) : Provides concessional financial support at zero interest rates

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IMF's primary function is to provide financial assistance to member countries facing balance of payments problems, not to fund specific projects like development banks.  Option 1 is incorrect because the IMF does not lend for specific projects.  The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), launched in 2024, indeed consolidates guarantee products and expertise from various World Bank Group institutions under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This makes option 2 correct.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) focuses on providing concessional financing (currently at zero interest rates) to low-income countries. Option 3 is wrong as it describes the RST.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) offers affordable, longer-term financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to enhance resilience against external shocks.  Therefore, option 4 is correct.


**2. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Characteristic
    1. India Stack                                   :   Includes a payment layer exemplified by BHIM
    2. One Future Alliance                           :   A G20 initiative focused on capacity building in DPI for high-income countries
    3. Global DPI Repository (GDPIR)                 :   Launched at the 2023 G20 virtual leaders' summit
    4.  EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)      :   Has no stated involvement in DPI development


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India Stack, India's foundational DPI, indeed comprises an identity layer (Aadhaar), a payment layer (UPI, which includes BHIM), and a data governance layer (DigiLocker). This makes option 1 correct. The One Future Alliance, a voluntary initiative proposed by the G20 India Presidency, aims to build capacity and provide support for implementing DPI in low and middle-income countries, not high-income countries. Option 2 is therefore incorrect. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was announced during the 2023 G20 virtual leaders' summit, making option 3 correct. The EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) has actively discussed and agreed to collaborate with India on accelerating DPI development and deployment globally. Therefore, option 4 is incorrect.


**3. With reference to  India's initiatives in the logistics sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                       Feature
    1. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)           :   Planned investment outlay of $6.2 Billion
    2. Bharatmala Pariyojana                         :   Construction of approximately 65,000 km of national highways
    3. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)             :   Aimed at reducing the share of rail freight traffic to 27% by 2030
    4.  Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) :  Focuses on decreasing freight transport efficiency

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The government's plan for Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) does include a planned investment of $6.2 billion.  Therefore, option 1 is correct.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of national highways in two phases, making option 2 correct. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are designed to *increase*, not decrease, the share of rail freight traffic to 45% by 2030.  Option 3 is therefore incorrect. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) aims to *improve*, not decrease, freight transport efficiency; thus, option 4 is incorrect.


**4. With reference to  the  Indian economy and its policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                             Description
    1.  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                 :   Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
    2.  Telecommunications Act, 2023             :   Established the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
    3.  National Technical Textiles Mission        :   Aims to make India the largest technical textile market globally
    4. Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)          :   Includes services sector as a component

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, indeed replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). This makes option 1 correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, is responsible for the creation of DBN and did not establish USOF; that was under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  Option 2 is incorrect. The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to position India as a global leader in technical textiles, not necessarily the largest market. Option 3 is partially correct, though the phrasing is imprecise.  The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) measures the production of eight core industries – fertilizers, cement, natural gas, crude oil, coal, electricity, steel, and petroleum refinery products – and does not include the services sector.  Option 4 is incorrect.


**5. With reference to  Trade Agreements and Organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Organization                      Feature
    1. Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)        :   Assists Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to use trade for growth
    2.  World Trade Organization (WTO)             :   Adopted the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies in 2022
    3.  Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies         :   Has been accepted by two-thirds of WTO members
    4.  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge : Addresses the interface between intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is indeed dedicated to assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in leveraging trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction. Option 1 is correct. The World Trade Organization (WTO) did adopt the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies in 2022, making option 2 correct.  However, as of December 2024, the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies had not yet been accepted by two-thirds of WTO members, making option 3 incorrect. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge is the first WIPO treaty addressing the interface between intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge, making option 4 correct.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                         Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Human Development Index (HDI)             :   Developed by Amartya Sen
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)              :   Measures inequalities in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) :  Adjusts HDI for planetary pressures
4. Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index :  Reflects concern for intergenerational inequality

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Inequality Index (GII) accurately measures gender inequalities across three crucial dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity (labor market participation).  This makes statement 2 correct.  The HDI was not developed by Amartya Sen, although he significantly influenced its conceptualization.  It was primarily developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq.  The IHDI accounts for inequality within a country's HDI, not planetary pressures. The Planetary pressures-adjusted HDI is designed to consider environmental sustainability and intergenerational equity, correctly reflecting the concern for the future. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Poverty Index/Measure                      Key Organization/Initiative
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) :   World Bank
2. India’s National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI) :   Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)
3.  Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)   :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is a joint initiative of the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), making statement 3 correct.  India's National MPI (NMPI) is indeed introduced by NITI Aayog, a policy think tank of the Government of India, rendering statement 2 correct.  The World Bank is not primarily associated with the MPI's development or implementation. The World Bank's involvement is more related to overall poverty reduction strategies and data analysis, not the specific MPI methodology. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative/Policy             Key Feature/Objective
1. KISAN                                   :   Improvement in yield estimation using space technology
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)       :   Provides real-time information on crop conditions
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :   India’s first data exchange platform for farmer services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) directly aims to improve yield estimation using space technology and geospatial data, making statement 1 correct.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is a platform for farmer services, primarily focusing on data aggregation and exchange, not real-time crop condition monitoring. That function is primarily performed by the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS), which integrates remote sensing data. The ICCC leverages technology for informed decision-making in agriculture, but it is not the first data exchange platform for farmer services; ADeX holds that distinction.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop/Commodity                              Associated Scheme/Policy
1. Wheat                                       :   PM Matsya Sampada Yojana
2.  Rabi Crops                                  :   Minimum Support Price (MSP)
3.  Seaweed                                    :   Agricultural Export Policy 2018


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism directly covers Rabi crops, including wheat, ensuring a minimum price for farmers, making statement 2 correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana focuses on the fisheries and aquaculture sector, not wheat production. The Agricultural Export Policy 2018 aims to boost agricultural exports, but seaweed farming is addressed through separate initiatives like the NITI Aayog's report on seaweed value chain development.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Livestock Initiative/Program              Key Objective/Feature
1.  Unified Genomic Chip (‘Gau Chip’)     :  Eradication of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
2.  National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) :   Development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds
3.  Rashtriya Gokul Mission                 :   Increase the availability of sex-sorted semen


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Gokul Mission primarily aims at the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds and improving their productivity, making statement 3 correct. The Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip') is a tool for genetic improvement and traceability, not directly for disease eradication. The NADCP focuses on controlling and eradicating specific animal diseases like FMD and Brucellosis. The increase in the availability of sex-sorted semen is related to improving breeding efficiency, often part of broader programs like the Rashtriya Gokul Mission but not its sole focus. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agency/Organization                        Associated Initiative/Program
1.  NITI Aayog                               :   Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)
2.  Ministry of Cooperatives                :   White Revolution 2.0
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Regulation of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Cooperatives is indeed involved in promoting and guiding the "White Revolution 2.0" initiative, which focuses on the dairy sector, making statement 2 correct.  The RBI plays a crucial regulatory role for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, ensuring their financial stability and responsible lending practices, making statement 3 correct. NITI Aayog's role is primarily in policy and strategy, not direct implementation of PMMY; PMMY is largely implemented through banks and other financial institutions. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fishery Initiative/Program                 Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) :   Development of Integrated Aquaparks
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) :   Promotion of fisheries start-ups
3. Rangeen Machhli app                       :   Multilingual information on ornamental fish species


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PMMSY (Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana) aims to improve fish production and productivity, including the development of integrated aquaparks and adoption of advanced technologies, making statement 1 correct. The Rangeen Machhli app offers multilingual information on ornamental fish species, making statement 3 correct.  The FIDF primarily focuses on creating infrastructure for fisheries, not directly on promoting start-ups;  that aspect is handled through other initiatives like incubation centers. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Research Body               Key Function/Responsibility
1. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) :  Regulation of Microfinance Institutions

3. Central Silk Board                       :   Coordination of research and education in agriculture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ICAR-NISA (National Institute of Secondary Agriculture) focuses on research and education related to secondary agriculture, which involves value addition of primary agricultural products, making statement 2 correct.  The Central Silk Board is responsible for promoting and developing the silk industry in India, a significant agricultural sub-sector, making statement 3 correct. The ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) is the apex body for coordinating research and education in agriculture, not the regulation of MFIs; that falls under the RBI.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Employment/Labor Statistic                  Key Source/Survey
1. Unemployment Rate for 2023               :   National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
2.  Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)      :   Estimates key employment and unemployment indicators
3. Global Unemployment Rate                  :   Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) is specifically designed to estimate key employment and unemployment indicators in India, making statement 2 correct. The NFHS (National Family Health Survey) focuses on health and family welfare indicators, not employment data. The global unemployment rate is compiled from various international sources and surveys, not solely from the PLFS. The PLFS is a national-level survey. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Institution/Policy              Key Area of Focus/Regulation
1. Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)           :   Microfinance loan regulation
2. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)      :   Loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises
3. Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank:   Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability of UCBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) specifically targets providing loans to non-corporate, non-farm small and micro enterprises, making statement 2 correct.  The regulation of microfinance loans primarily falls under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not UCBs.  The monitoring of capital, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs is a function of banking regulators, not SEWA Bank, which is one specific MFI. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Poverty Measure                          Key Feature
    1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) :   Launched in 2010
    2. India’s National MPI (NMPI)           :   Uses National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data
    3. Human Development Index (HDI)        :    Developed by Amartya Sen
    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global MPI was indeed launched in 2010, reflecting a multidimensional approach to poverty measurement beyond simple income levels.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, leverages data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) to assess multidimensional poverty within the Indian context.  This makes option (b) correct. Option (d) is incorrect because the HDI was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq, not Amartya Sen, although Sen has significantly contributed to the conceptual framework of human development. Option (a) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index                                     Measuring Aspect
    1. Gender Inequality Index (GII)          :   Disparities in HDI achievements between genders
    2. Gender Development Index (GDI)        :    Gender inequalities in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market
    3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI):   Adjusts HDI for planetary pressures
    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Inequality Index (GII) accurately measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market.  The Gender Development Index (GDI) correctly measures disparities in HDI achievements between men and women.  Therefore, options 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option 3 is incorrect; the IHDI adjusts the HDI for inequalities within a country, not for planetary pressures. That aspect is covered by the Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Indicator                     Description
    1. Insurance Penetration                :   Ratio of insurance premium to population
    2. Insurance Density                    :   Percentage of insurance premium to GDP
    3. Prosperity Gap                       :   Average factor by which incomes need to be multiplied to reach $25 per person per day
    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The definition of the Prosperity Gap is accurately described. Insurance penetration is the percentage of insurance premium to GDP, not the ratio of insurance premium to population (that's insurance density).  Insurance density is the ratio of insurance premium to population.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Initiative                 Focus Area

    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NADCP accurately targets FMD and Brucellosis. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission correctly focuses on indigenous bovine breeds. The Pandemic Fund Project is concerned with animal health threats and pandemic preparedness, not specifically plant diseases. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                      Description/Data
1.  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) :  Launched in 2010, measures deprivations in education, health, and living standards.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI)                  :  Introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, uses NFHS data, includes maternal health and bank account indicators.
3.  Prosperity Gap                              :  Average factor by which incomes need to be multiplied to reach $25 per person per day globally.
4.  Polycrisis                                   :  Simultaneous occurrence of slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and uncertainty.
5.  Headcount Ratio (in context of MPI)        :  Share of population living below a defined poverty line.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Global MPI, as described, accurately reflects its core features – its launch year, the areas of deprivation it measures, and its purpose.  India's NMPI is correctly paired with its introduction year, the data source it utilizes, and the addition of maternal health and bank account as indicators. The Prosperity Gap definition aligns perfectly with its description in the provided text. The definition of Polycrisis precisely captures the simultaneous crises described. Finally, the Headcount Ratio, within the MPI context, is correctly defined as the percentage of the population below the poverty line.  There are no discrepancies or misleading information in any of the pairs.  Each pair accurately represents a specific concept and its associated details from the provided information.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Policy                        Specific Detail

APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) explicitly works to promote agricultural exports. The WEF's AI4AI initiative focuses on scaling agritech services through public-private partnerships (PPPs).  Therefore, all the options excluding (c) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched ones. The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of key organizations and their mandates in the agricultural sector.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                                     Application/Purpose
1.  Yuktix GreenSense                                   :   Remote monitoring solution in agriculture
2.  Gau Chip                                             :   Genomic analysis of cattle
3.  Indigenous sex-sorted technology                     :   Reduced cost semen for female calves
4.  Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES)   :   Soil profile mapping


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Yuktix GreenSense is a remote monitoring solution used in agriculture.  The Gau Chip is a genomic tool used for cattle. Indigenous sex-sorted technology aims to reduce the cost of producing female calves. However, the DGCES provides yield estimates, not soil profile mapping, making pair 4 incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 4 or exclude correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate’s understanding of specific technologies and their applications in the agricultural sector.  The distractor (DGCES paired with soil mapping) is a plausible but incorrect pairing, requiring careful attention to detail.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                      Responsibility/Function
1.  Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)       :   Final decision on MSP
2.  Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) :   Recommends MSP
3.  Food Corporation of India (FCI)                    :   Procuring agency for jute and copra
4.  Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying       :   Development of Mahish Chip


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The CCEA takes the final decision on MSPs. The CACP recommends MSPs to the government. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying developed the Mahish Chip. However, FCI is the nodal procuring agency for wheat and paddy, not jute and copra, making pair 3 incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or exclude correctly matched pairs.  The question tests knowledge of the institutional framework surrounding MSP determination and livestock development initiatives.  The inclusion of FCI as a distractor highlights the need for precise knowledge of the roles of different government agencies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                    Key Feature
1. Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)             :   Interest subvention of 3% per annum for loans up to ₹2 Crores
2. PM KUSUM Component-A                           :   Convergence with AIF for farmer groups and cooperatives
3.  FASAL Project                                    :   Provides early forecasts of crop output using space technology

5.  NABARD Sanrakshan                              :   Extension of AIF credit guarantee coverage to Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) indeed offers interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage as described. PM KUSUM Component-A explicitly allows convergence with AIF for various entities including farmer groups. The FASAL project utilizes space technology for crop output forecasting. Similarly, KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation.  Finally, NABARD Sanrakshan's role in expanding AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs is accurately represented.  Therefore, all five pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                       Provision/Outcome
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999                  :   Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge

3. Marrakesh Agreement                               :   Established the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995
4.  WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):  Aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion
5.  Peace Clause (WTO)                               :   Interim solution for public stockholding for food security


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, grants collective, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  However, the remaining pairs are correctly matched. The WTO Agreement on Agriculture covers the three pillars mentioned. The Marrakesh Agreement led to the establishment of the WTO. The Geneva Package on fisheries subsidies aims to curb harmful practices. The Peace Clause provided a temporary solution regarding public stockholding. Thus, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Option (d) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs (2, 3, 4, and 5).

5.  Statistical report on value of output from agriculture and allied sectors (NSO): Agriculture and allied sector accounted for 18.2% of the Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2022-23


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs accurately reflect the key findings and features of the respective reports.  The fourth pair is incorrect; while the World Economic Forum produces reports on global competitiveness, the specific content described is from a different report on Agritech. The fifth pair is correctly matched. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete. Option (c) accurately represents the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                   Function/Initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. APEDA's role in GI registration is well-established. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying developed the genomic chips mentioned. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates PPP projects. The Ministry of Cooperatives released the SOPs for White Revolution 2.0. The World Bank published the report on middle-income traps.  Therefore, all options except (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Scheme                                    Objective/Focus
1. National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) :   Control and eradication of FMD and Brucellosis
2. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                         :   Development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly match the program/scheme with its stated objective or focus.  The NADCP aims to control and eradicate specific animal diseases. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on indigenous cattle breeds. The Pandemic Fund Project addresses animal health threats and pandemic preparedness. TIES supports export-related infrastructure development.  The MAI scheme promotes exports through a focused approach.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, and only option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                     :   Focuses on improving productivity of indigenous bovine breeds
2. National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) : Aims at controlling FMD and Brucellosis in poultry
3.  Unified Genomic Chip (‘Gau Chip’/‘Mahish Chip’) : Developed by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare
4. Pandemic Fund Project                       : Implemented by the World Health Organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Gokul Mission's primary objective is indeed the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, aiming to improve their productivity.  Option (a) is thus correct.  Option (b) is incorrect because while NADCP aims to control Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, it does not exclusively target poultry; it encompasses a broader range of livestock. Option (c) is partially correct regarding the Rashtriya Gokul Mission but incorrect about the Pandemic Fund Project's implementing entity. The Pandemic Fund Project is implemented by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the WHO.  Option (d) is incorrect due to the misattribution of the Unified Genomic Chip's development to the wrong ministry. It was developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related government schemes and their specific mandates.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options makes the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative                         Primary Data Source
1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) :   RISAT-1A satellite imagery
2.  FASAL Project                               :   Agro-meteorological data
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)           :   Survey of India basemaps
4. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC):  Farmer-provided crop data


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

KISAN leverages space technology, including data from RISAT-1A, for improved crop yield estimation, making pair 1 correct. The FASAL project relies heavily on agro-meteorological data for forecasting agricultural output, making pair 2 correct.  Option (b) is therefore the correct answer. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of FASAL. Option (c) is incorrect because ADeX does not primarily utilize Survey of India basemaps; its data sources include farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crop-sown data. Option (d) is incorrect as ICCC uses a range of data sources including remote sensing, AI, and GIS, but farmer-provided crop data is not the *primary* source. This question tests the candidate's understanding of specific Indian agricultural initiatives and their reliance on various data sources, demanding detailed factual recall and analytical skills to differentiate between primary and secondary data sources.


**3. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                            Objective
1. Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)       :   To provide loans for only post-harvest management infrastructure
2. PM KUSUM (Component A)                    :   To promote solar-powered irrigation systems in collaboration with AIF
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)      :   To generate investment by monetising government assets in the agricultural sector
4.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)                :  To ensure farmers receive a minimum price for 22 specified crops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) does indeed provide financing for post-harvest management infrastructure, but it also extends to community farming assets, making statement 1 partially incorrect.  PM KUSUM Component A aims at promoting solar-powered irrigation, and it does allow convergence with AIF, making statement 2 correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) focuses on monetising various government assets, but its direct application to the agricultural sector is not the central focus, making statement 3 incorrect.  The MSP system is designed to guarantee a minimum price for 22 crops, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are entirely correct, making option (b) the correct answer. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various Indian agricultural schemes and their specific goals, requiring detailed knowledge and the ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements based on their nuances. The distractors are designed to test comprehension of the schemes' broader scope.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Concept/Indicator                     Description
1. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)          :   Measures poverty based solely on income levels
2.  Poverty Headcount Ratio                     :   Represents the percentage of the population below the poverty line
3.  Prosperity Gap                               :   The difference between actual income and the income required for a $25/day standard of living
4.  Middle-Income Trap                           :   A situation where economies stagnate at middle-income levels and fail to transition to high-income


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The MPI is a multidimensional measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education and health, making statement 1 incorrect. The Poverty Headcount Ratio accurately reflects the percentage of the population below the poverty line, making statement 2 correct. The Prosperity Gap correctly describes the difference between actual income and the income needed to reach a specific prosperity standard, making statement 3 correct. The Middle-Income Trap describes the phenomenon of economies getting stuck at middle-income levels, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are entirely accurate, making option (b) the correct answer. This question evaluates the candidate's understanding of key economic concepts and indicators related to poverty and economic development, requiring a precise understanding of definitions and their applications.  The incorrect options test knowledge of the nuances of each concept.


**5. With reference to the White Revolution 2.0, consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on indigenous bovine breed conservation and productivity improvement, not directly on enhancing milk procurement infrastructure.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The National Programme for Dairy Development aims to enhance milk quality and increase organized procurement by strengthening infrastructure, making pair 2 correctly matched.  The Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund incentivizes investments in dairy processing and value addition infrastructure, making pair 3 correctly matched. Operation Flood was a multi-phase program designed to revolutionize India's dairy sector, making pair 4 correctly matched.  Thus, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of initiatives related to India's dairy sector and their objectives, requiring precise recall and understanding of their distinct roles within the broader context of White Revolution 2.0.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's detailed understanding of the schemes.

3. NABARD's NAFIS Survey                     :   Measures financial inclusion in rural areas
4. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)       :   Provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987 mandates the use of jute packaging for certain commodities. The Jute I-CARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) Project focuses on mechanizing jute farming and improving the retting process using microbial consortia. NABARD's NAFIS (NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey) is a comprehensive survey that assesses the financial inclusion status of the rural population, and a key metric derived from NAFIS is NAFINDEX.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is a government initiative that provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small and micro enterprises. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to Rural Financial Inclusion in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Function/Characteristic
1. Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) :   Registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) :   Provide funds to PACS
3. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) :   Refinances PACS through DCCBs and SCBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS).  NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) refinances PACS through DCCBs and State Cooperative Banks (SCBs).  However, PACS are not registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; they are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act. Therefore, option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Act                     Characteristic/Function
1. Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)      :   Regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)
2.  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 :   Provides for a time-bound resolution process for distressed businesses
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)               :   Regulates Microfinance Institutions (MFIs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 aims to provide a time-bound resolution process for distressed businesses, improving recovery rates for creditors and offering an exit mechanism for financially stressed companies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) operating in India.  ARCs are regulated by the RBI, not SEBI.  Therefore, option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Indian Fisheries Sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Technology                       Description/Purpose

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Pandemic Fund Project, a $25 million initiative, focuses on strengthening animal health security in India for pandemic preparedness and response. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims at the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds and improving their productivity. The Vessel Communication and Support System (VCS) was developed by ISRO, not DRDO, to establish two-way communication with fishermen for emergency rescue and safety.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                    Key Feature/Organization
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)   :   Published solely by the World Bank
2. Human Development Report (HDR)             :   Includes the Human Development Index (HDI)
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) :   Measures inequality within HDI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Human Development Report (HDR), published annually by the UNDP, includes the Human Development Index (HDI) as its core measure. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) measures the loss in HDI due to inequality.  The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is jointly published by the UNDP and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not solely by the World Bank. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**6. With reference to Monetary Policy tools of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Tool                                   Effect on Liquidity/Interest Rates
1. Open Market Operations (OMO) - Buying G-secs :   Increases interest rates
2. Variable Rate Repo (VRR)                    :   Injects short-term liquidity
3. Increase in CRR, SLR, Repo Rate             :   Decreases market liquidity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is a tool used by the RBI to inject short-term liquidity into the banking system. Increasing the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), and Repo Rate leads to a decrease in market liquidity as banks have less money available to lend.  Buying government securities (G-secs) under OMO decreases interest rates, not increases them, by increasing the money supply. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                     Function/Characteristic
1. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) :   Established in 1924
2. ICAR-NISA                                   :   Falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. ICAR-NISA (formerly the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums) falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) estimates key employment and unemployment indicators.  The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) was established in 1929, not 1924. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**8. With reference to stressed assets and debt resolution in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                                 Definition/Characteristic
1. Wilful Default                               :   Borrower lacks the capacity to repay
2. Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA)              :   Allocates collateral among common lenders in case of default
3. Large Defaulter                             :   Default with an outstanding amount below ₹1 crore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. An Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA) outlines the terms and allocation of collateral among common lenders if a borrower defaults.  A wilful default occurs when a borrower has the capacity to pay but defaults, often involving diversion of funds or asset disposal. A large defaulter is defined as a default with an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.

4.  Inheritance Tax                                     :   Currently not imposed in India but was previously levied as Estate Duty
5.  Green Shoots (in FMCG sector)                     :   Signs of economic growth after a downturn


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of various aspects of India's financial sector.  Each pair is correctly matched: PACS operate on a cooperative model, the ISI mark is a BIS standard, APAs are handled by the CBDT, inheritance tax is absent currently, and green shoots describe economic recovery.  The breadth of topics covered makes this a challenging and comprehensive question.  The inclusion of both direct and indirect tax-related concepts and  agricultural credit institutions increases the difficulty level.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                        Focus Area
1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana              :  Seaweed production target of 1 million tons per year by 2025

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is a comprehensive scheme aimed at boosting fish production and productivity.  A key target under PMMSY is achieving 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, reflecting the government's focus on seaweed cultivation as a sustainable economic activity.  The Rangeen Machhli app, developed under PMMSY, indeed provides multilingual information on ornamental fish species. The National Fisheries Development Program Portal, also a part of PMMSY, facilitates various aspects of the fisheries sector, including strengthening the value chain. However, the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) focuses on creating infrastructure for both marine and inland fisheries, not on promoting specific fish species through an app.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairings of 3 and 4. Option (b) is partially correct but misses the accurate pairing of the National Fisheries Development Program Portal. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of FIDF with the Rangeen Machhli app.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                   Key Feature/Objective
1.  NITI Aayog                             : Celebrated its platinum jubilee recently
2.  Central Silk Board                     : Published a report on seaweed value chain development
3.  ICAR-NISA                              :  Established in 1924 as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums
4.  Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying: Developed the ‘Gau Chip’ for cattle

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ICAR-NISA (National Institute of Secondary Agriculture) was indeed established in 1924 as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is responsible for the development of the ‘Gau Chip’ for cattle.  However, the NITI Aayog published the report on seaweed value chain development, not the Central Silk Board.  The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its platinum jubilee. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing. Option (c) is also incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of ICAR-NISA with its establishment date. Option (d) is incorrect because it mistakenly attributes the seaweed report to the Central Silk Board and the platinum jubilee to NITI Aayog.


**3. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                     Core Component/Characteristic
1. Agri Stack (Kisan ki Pehchaan)      : Integrates remote sensing data for real-time crop information
2. Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) :  Provides yield estimates through Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES)
3.  PM GatiShakti                       : Aims to create digital identities for 11 crore farmers over three years
4. Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme: Addresses antimicrobial resistance in livestock


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Agri Stack's core function is to create a digital identity for farmers, streamlining service delivery.  The Krishi Decision Support System uses remote sensing and geospatial data to provide real-time information on crop conditions, weather, and water resources. The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme tackles the issue of antimicrobial resistance in the livestock sector. The Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES), however, is a component of the Soil Profile Mapping initiative, not directly under the Krishi DSS.  PM GatiShakti is a national master plan focusing on infrastructure development, not directly on creating digital farmer IDs.  Therefore, option (a) is partially correct but misses the correct pairing of Krishi DSS with its functionality. Option (b) is incorrect as it contains only one correct pairing. Option (d) incorrectly links PM GatiShakti with the digital farmer ID creation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Provision/Impact
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999           :  Guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge

3.  Quality Control Order                      : Envisages 300 million tonnes of steel-making capacity by 2030-31
4.  Production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for speciality steel: Aims to reduce imports of specialty steel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act 1999 indeed protects collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with products. The Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for speciality steel is designed to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on imports.  However, the National Steel Policy 2017 does not mandate the ISI mark; that's done through a separate Quality Control Order.  The Quality Control Order itself mandates the ISI mark, not the National Steel Policy.  Therefore, option (a) is partially correct but misses the correct pairing of the PLI scheme for specialty steel. Option (c) is incorrect, as it wrongly includes the pairing of National Steel Policy 2017 with the ISI mark mandate. Option (d) is incorrect as it contains two incorrect pairings.


**5. With reference to India's infrastructure sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                         Characteristic/Objective
1.  Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)    :  Aims to increase rail freight traffic share to 45% by 2030
2.  Bharatmala Pariyojana                 :  Plans to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways
3.  Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs)     :  Government has planned 35 parks with a $6.2 Billion investment outlay
4.  Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index: Measures logistics efficiency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bharatmala Pariyojana is indeed focused on the construction of National Highways. The LEADS index accurately measures logistics efficiency across different states.  However, the Dedicated Freight Corridors aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic, and the Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) involve a significant investment outlay. Therefore, option (b) is incorrect as it wrongly includes the pairing of MMLPs with the highway construction. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly includes the pairing of DFCs with the investment outlay. Option (d) is incorrect because it contains two incorrect pairings.



**1. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective
    1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                         :   Focuses on seaweed cultivation
    2. Digital Agriculture Mission                         :   Aims to create digital identities for farmers
    3. Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)              :   Provides medium-long term debt financing for post-harvest infrastructure
    4. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                           :    Concentrates on indigenous bovine breed development

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to boost fish production, including seaweed cultivation, as part of its aquaculture component. The Digital Agriculture Mission leverages technology to create digital identities for farmers, streamlining services and data management. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) provides financial assistance for post-harvest infrastructure development.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission is specifically designed to improve and conserve indigenous cattle breeds in India.  Therefore, option (d) is the accurate answer, encompassing all correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to India's agricultural policies and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                                      Specific Crop/Commodity
    1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                       :   Primarily covers Kharif crops only
    2. India’s Agricultural Export Policy                  :   Set a target of $60 billion agricultural exports by 2022
    3. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES)     :   Focuses on upgradation of cold chains for export
    4.  National Horticulture Mission (under MIDH)       :   Exclusively deals with fruit production

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While MSP covers Kharif and Rabi crops, as well as some commercial crops, the statement that it *primarily* covers Kharif crops is misleading and not entirely accurate.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. Pairs 2 and 3 are accurately matched. The India’s Agricultural Export Policy aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, and TIES focuses on infrastructure upgrades, including cold chains. Pair 4 is incorrect; the National Horticulture Mission covers a wider range of horticultural produce beyond just fruits.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to Agricultural Research and Institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Organization                                 Key Function/Characteristic
    1. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)      :  Established in 1924
    2. ICAR-National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA) :  Focuses solely on primary agricultural research
    3. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK)                         :   Functions as a district-level knowledge and resource center for agricultural technology
    4. Central Silk Board                                 :   Responsible for promoting only Mulberry silk production

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

ICAR was established in 1929, not 1924, making pair 1 incorrectly matched.  ICAR-NISA focuses on secondary agriculture, which includes value addition to primary agricultural products, therefore pair 2 is also incorrect. KVKs indeed serve as district-level knowledge centers for agricultural technology, making pair 3 correct. The Central Silk Board promotes all varieties of silk, not just Mulberry, therefore making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct option.


**4. Considering the Indian Economy and its sectors, consider the following pairs:**

    Sector/Industry                                         Characteristic/Initiative
    1.  Fishing and Aquaculture Sector                     : Contributes less than 2% to India's GDP
    2.  Seaweed Farming                                   :  Part of aquaculture and valuable for bioactive compounds

    4. Bio-Economy                                        :  Grew from $10 billion in 2014 to over $130 billion in 2024

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% to India's GDP, not less than 2%, making pair 1 incorrect. Seaweed farming is a part of aquaculture and has significant economic and environmental value, correctly matched in pair 2. The steel sector is indeed a recipient of funds under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, aligning with pair 3. The bio-economy's growth trajectory from $10 billion in 2014 to over $130 billion in 2024 is accurate, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, leading to option (b) as the correct answer.


**5. With reference to employment and labor statistics in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Survey/Statistic                                      Key Finding/Characteristic
    1. Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)                : Launched in 2017 to estimate employment indicators
    2. Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)                   : Covers only factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948
    3. Unemployment Rate (PLFS 2023)                     :  Significantly higher than the global unemployment rate
    4.  Global Unemployment Rate (2023)                   : Reported as 5.1%


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PLFS was indeed launched in 2017, making pair 1 correct.  While ASI covers factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948, it also includes other entities making pair 2 incorrect. The unemployment rate in India for 2023, as per PLFS, was lower than the global rate, making pair 3 incorrect. The global unemployment rate is reported as 5.1% for 2023, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched, resulting in option (a) as the correct answer.


**1. With reference to India's agricultural landscape, consider the following pairs:**

    Technology Initiative                     Description
    1. KISAN                               :   Uses blockchain technology for land record management.
    2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)   :   Primarily focuses on livestock disease surveillance.
    3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :  Employs solely artificial intelligence for yield prediction.
    4.  Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) :  Provides real-time information on soil moisture levels.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **KISAN (C[K]rop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics):**  This initiative uses space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation, not blockchain technology for land record management.  Blockchain technology is not a core component of KISAN as described in the provided text.

2. **Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX):** ADeX holds three primary datasets: farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data. It is not primarily focused on livestock disease surveillance.  Livestock data might be included in broader agricultural datasets but is not ADeX's central purpose.

3. **Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC):** ICCC uses a combination of technologies including artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems for informed decision-making in agriculture.  It does not rely solely on artificial intelligence for yield prediction.  A multifaceted approach is used.

4. **Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES):** DGCES is part of the larger initiative to provide yield estimates, not real-time soil moisture information. Soil moisture data might be a component of the broader assessment, but not the primary function of DGCES itself.


All the provided descriptions in the pairs misrepresent the actual functions of the listed agricultural technology initiatives.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.



**2. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Crop Category                      Number of Crops Covered
    1. Kharif Crops                     :   10
    2. Rabi Crops                       :   8
    3. Commercial Crops                 :   4
    4. Additional Crops (Toria & De-husked Coconut): 2

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The provided numbers of crops covered under each category are incorrect.  Let's examine each pair:

1. **Kharif Crops:** The text explicitly states that 14 Kharif crops are covered under the MSP.  Therefore, the statement "10" is incorrect.

2. **Rabi Crops:**  The text mentions 6 Rabi crops covered under the MSP. The number "8" is incorrect.

3. **Commercial Crops:** The text clearly indicates that MSP covers 2 commercial crops (Jute and copra).  The number "4" is incorrect.

4. **Additional Crops:** The text correctly mentions that MSP is also fixed for Toria and de-husked coconut, based on the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard, and copra, respectively.  The number "2" is correct for this category but the other incorrect pairings make the overall answer 'None'.

Because none of the provided numbers accurately reflect the actual number of crops covered under each category as detailed in the source material, none of the pairs are correctly matched.



**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Product Category             Percentage of Total Exports in 2023-24
    1. Rice                                 :   15%
    2. Marine Products                       :   21%
    3. Spices                               :    5%
    4. Vegetable Oil Imports                 :   45%

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The percentages given for the agricultural product categories are not accurately represented. Let's break down the inaccuracies:

1. **Rice:**  The text states that rice constituted 21% of total agricultural exports, not 15%.

2. **Marine Products:**  The text indicates marine products constituted 15% of total agricultural exports, not 21%.

3. **Spices:** The source mentions that spices made up 9% of total exports, not 5%.

4. **Vegetable Oil Imports:** While the text does mention that vegetable oil constituted 45% of *imports*, the question asks about the percentage of total *exports*.  This is a crucial distinction.  The percentage of vegetable oil in total exports is not provided.

Because the provided percentages are incorrect or pertain to imports rather than exports, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the data presented.  Distractors are created by using plausible but incorrect percentages and by confusing imports and exports.




**4. With reference to the initiatives taken for promoting agricultural exports in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                    Primary Objective
    1. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) :   Focus on specific products for specific countries.
    2. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme          :   Upgrading export-related infrastructure.
    3. Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme :   Assisting international freight and marketing.
    4. APEDA                                         :   Overseeing organic export certification.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES):** TIES's primary objective is to assist in setting up and upgrading infrastructure projects with strong export linkages, not focusing on specific products for specific countries.  That is the MAI's focus.

2. **Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme:** The MAI Scheme is designed to evolve specific market and product approaches through market studies and surveys. It does not primarily focus on upgrading export-related infrastructure. That is the TIES initiative.

3. **Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme:** The TMA Scheme accurately aims to provide assistance for the international component of freight and marketing of agricultural produce.

4. **APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority):** APEDA serves as the secretariat to the National Accreditation Board and oversees the accreditation of Certification Bodies for organic exports under the National Programme for Organic Production. This is correctly matched.

Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The distractors play on the close relationship between the initiatives and their slightly-off objectives. The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of specific government schemes in the agricultural sector.


**5. With reference to India's Livestock Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    3. Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying     :   Improving cattle productivity.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) Only one

**Explanation:**

Let's examine each pair:

1. **Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme:** This scheme aims to improve overall livestock health and production, not specifically the development of genomic chips.  While genomic chips might be *part* of the broader scheme, it is not the primary focus.

2. **Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip'):** These chips are indeed developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, but their primary focus is on improving animal identification and traceability, not directly on reducing antimicrobial resistance.  Antimicrobial resistance is a separate concern addressed through other initiatives.

3. **Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying:** The department works towards improving various aspects of the livestock sector, including productivity, but it's not solely focused on productivity improvement.  This is a too broad statement to be considered a correct match.

Only the statement regarding the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying's involvement in improving cattle productivity is a reasonably accurate, albeit broad, statement.  The other pairs are incorrect due to mismatched primary focuses. The question highlights the need for precise understanding of the roles and objectives of various initiatives and government departments.

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, although the MCA handles certain aspects of their incorporation and corporate governance.  Payment System Participants are indeed regulated by the RBI to ensure the smooth and secure functioning of payment systems.  Chit Fund Companies are regulated by the respective State Governments, as their operations primarily occur within state jurisdictions.  Nidhi Companies are regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, not the RBI.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                       Detail
1.  Introduced in the IBC                      :   2018
2.  Available for defaults of at least           :   ₹5 lakh
3.  Maximum completion period                  :   180 days
4.  Initiated by                               :   Creditor


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. PPIRP was introduced in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in 2021, not 2018. It's available for defaults of at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹5 lakh. The maximum completion period is 120 days, not 180 days.  PPIRP is initiated voluntarily by the debtor, not the creditor.  All the pairs are incorrectly matched.


**4. With reference to the RBI's regulations, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation                                    Covered Entity/Aspect
1.  Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs    :  Housing Finance Companies
2.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework  :   All UCBs, except those under All Inclusive Directions (AID)
3.  Revised NPA Provision Norms               :   Only Urban Co-operative Banks
4.  Co-lending                                :  Prohibits co-lending with NBFCs belonging to the promoter group


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs excludes Housing Finance Companies.  The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework applies to Tier 2, 3, and 4 UCBs, excluding those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The revised NPA provision norms apply to urban, state, and central cooperative banks.  The co-lending regulation does prohibit co-lending arrangements with NBFCs from the promoter group.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Feature/Objective
1.  Geographical Indications Act, 1999             :   Protection of Industrial Designs
2.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan            :   Integration of ISRO satellite imagery
3.  Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use) Act, 1987 :   Mechanization in jute farming
4.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)          :   Monetizing government assets for investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects geographical indications, not industrial designs.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan does integrate ISRO satellite imagery. The Jute Packaging Materials Act focuses on compulsory use of jute packaging, not mechanization in jute farming (although related initiatives exist separately). The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to monetize government assets to generate investment. Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Levy                                     Governing Body/Act
1. GST                                          :   GST Council, Article 279A
2. Excise Duty (Petroleum & Liquor)           :   Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC)
3. State Excise Duty (Alcohol)                 :   State Governments
4. Equalization Levy (E-commerce)           :    Ministry of Finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is governed by the GST Council, a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Constitution.  Excise duty on petroleum products and liquor is collected by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), which evolved from the CBEC. State Excise duty on alcohol is levied and collected by individual state governments. The equalization levy on e-commerce transactions is a tax imposed and administered by the Ministry of Finance.  All the pairs accurately reflect the governing bodies or acts associated with the respective taxes and levies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting crucial pairings that are factually correct.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Levy                                     Key Characteristic/Impact
1. GST                                          :   Value-added tax (VAT)
2. Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)               :   Import duties on input goods higher than finished goods
3. Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax       :   Indexation benefits abolished (for properties acquired after July 23, 2024)
4. Excise Duty                                 :   Levied on goods manufactured in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

GST is fundamentally a value-added tax. An inverted duty structure (IDS) is characterized by higher import duties on input goods compared to finished goods. The amendment to the LTCG tax provisions eliminated indexation benefits for properties acquired after a specified date. Excise duty is a tax levied on goods manufactured within the country. All four pairs correctly match the tax/levy with its defining characteristic or impact.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Body                     Governing Act/Regulation
1. GST Appellate Tribunal                       :   CGST Act, 2017
2. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) :   Companies Act, 2013 & RBI Act, 1934
3. Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)      :   SARFAESI Act, 2002
4. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                  :  RBI Act, 1934

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GST Appellate Tribunal's establishment and functioning are governed by the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017. NaBFID, while established under a separate act, is also regulated by the RBI under provisions of the RBI Act, 1934, and notified as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013. ARCs are established and regulated under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act). The Reserve Bank of India's operations are governed by the RBI Act, 1934. All four pairings are accurate; thus, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   E-commerce Related Entity/Initiative        Key Feature/Objective
1. ONDC                                         :   Network-centric model
2. Inventory-based E-commerce Model          :   FDI not permitted in India
3. Marketplace-based E-commerce Model        :   100% FDI permitted under automatic route
4. Equalization Levy                           :   Tax on non-resident e-commerce companies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) operates on a network-centric model, aiming for a decentralized and interconnected e-commerce ecosystem.  India's policy restricts FDI in inventory-based e-commerce models to protect the domestic retail sector. Marketplace-based models, however, allow 100% FDI under the automatic route. The equalization levy was specifically designed to tax the revenue generated by non-resident e-commerce companies operating in India.  All the pairs given are correctly matched, making option (d) the only correct choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are factually incomplete.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act                             Primary Function/Objective
1. Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)       :   Administers direct tax laws
2. Competition Commission of India (CCI)      :   Promotes and sustains competition in markets
3. Ministry of Commerce and Industry          :   Addresses inverted duty structure issues
4.  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO):  Addresses interface between intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is the primary agency responsible for administering India's direct tax laws. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) is tasked with promoting and sustaining competition within the Indian market. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays a role in identifying and addressing issues related to inverted duty structures. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) focuses on the intersection of intellectual property rights, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge.  All four pairs present accurate pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to Indian Financial Regulations, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body                      Regulated Entity
    1. SEBI                               :  Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)
    2. RBI                                 :  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) except Brickwork Ratings
    3.  RBI                                :  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), overseeing their establishment, operations, and disclosures.  SEBI's regulations govern the issuance of units, investment guidelines, and other aspects of InvITs' functioning, ensuring investor protection and market integrity.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plays a crucial role in regulating Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs). While SEBI also has some regulatory oversight of CRAs, the RBI's role is significant, particularly in accrediting them as External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) for bank loan ratings.  All six major CRAs (excluding Brickwork Ratings) are RBI-accredited domestic CRAs.  The RBI also regulates the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC), an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND),  subject to RBI's oversight and regulatory framework for NBFCs.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to Indian Agricultural Policies and Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Institution                    Key Feature/Function
    1. Jute Corporation of India (JCI)   :  Implements the Jute I-CARE Project
    2. NABARD                               :  Conducts the All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS)
    3. Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) : Recommends Minimum Support Prices (MSPs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) is a price support agency for jute, and it actively implements the Jute I-CARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) project to improve jute farming practices.  The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) is responsible for conducting the All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), providing valuable data on financial inclusion in rural areas.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) plays a vital role in advising the government on Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for various agricultural commodities.  The CACP's recommendations are crucial for ensuring that farmers receive fair prices for their produce. Thus, all three pairs accurately reflect the functions and roles of the listed entities. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to Indian Infrastructure Development, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                   Key Characteristic/Objective
    1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan : Driven by seven engines of infrastructure development
    2. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) : Aims to generate investment by monetising government assets
    3. Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee : Evaluates central sector PPP projects

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a comprehensive initiative aimed at integrated infrastructure development. Its core strategy is driven by seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a strategic initiative focused on generating investment by monetising existing government assets. This involves leveraging the value of underutilized public assets to attract private investment and boost infrastructure development.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee is a crucial body that evaluates central sector PPP projects. Its role is to assess the viability, financial soundness, and overall effectiveness of PPP projects before they are implemented.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, highlighting the key features and objectives of these significant infrastructure initiatives. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. With reference to the Indian Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Process                     Role/Function
    1. Insolvency Professionals (IPs) : Regulated by Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs)
    2. Information Utilities (IUs)       : Collect, authenticate, and disseminate financial information of companies
    3. National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT):  Handles appeals against orders passed by the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Insolvency Professionals (IPs) are central figures in the IBC process, managing insolvency resolution and liquidation.  They are regulated by Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs) to maintain standards and ethical conduct. Information Utilities (IUs) play a critical role in gathering, verifying, and disseminating financial data about companies undergoing insolvency proceedings. This information is essential for efficient and transparent resolution processes.  The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is the adjudicating authority for corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRP) and liquidation.  Appeals against NCLT orders related to CIRP go to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), not the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair 2. Option (c) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because pair 3 is mismatched.


**5. With reference to the Indian Banking Sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Policy                      Characteristic/Objective
    1. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework : Aims to address the financial health of UCBs
    2. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC): Operates as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for UCBs
    3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)            : Appoints Ombudsmen for handling complaints against banks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework is designed to address the financial health of Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) with greater precision and flexibility. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) acts as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for the UCB sector, supporting their regulatory compliance and operational efficiency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) appoints Ombudsmen to handle complaints from customers against various banking institutions, ensuring a mechanism for redressal of grievances.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, reflecting the roles and functions of these entities within the Indian banking system. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**6. With reference to  Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Policy                           Feature
    1. Priority Sector Lending (PSL)          : Formalized in 1972
    2. PSL Certificates (PSLCs)               : Tradable certificates issued against priority sector loans
    3. Revised Priority Sector Lending Norms : Establish an incentive framework for districts with lower credit flow

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Priority Sector Lending (PSL) was formalized in 1972 to ensure credit access for vulnerable sections and underdeveloped areas. PSL Certificates (PSLCs) are tradable instruments issued against priority sector loans, allowing banks to meet their PSL targets and incentivizing lending to priority sectors. The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework for districts with lower credit flow, encouraging lending in underserved areas.  Therefore, all three pairs correctly describe aspects of PSL in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to  Indian Money Markets, consider the following pairs:**

    Benchmark/Rate                       Characteristic
    1. Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR) : A secured money market benchmark
    2.  MIBOR                                   :  Recommended changes in methodology by RBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR) is indeed a money market benchmark, it's not *secured*.  The RBI's recommendation to transition to a new secured benchmark highlights this fact.  Therefore, only the second statement is entirely correct. The RBI did recommend changes to the MIBOR calculation methodology.  Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the partially correct first pair. Option (c) is incorrect as the first pair is only partially correct. Option (d) is incorrect as the second pair is completely correct.


**8. With reference to Indian Agricultural Technology and Data, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Platform                    Purpose/Feature
    1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) : Improvement in yield estimation
    2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) : Holds data on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown
    3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Utilizes AI and remote sensing for informed decision-making in agriculture

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics to improve crop yield estimation, enhancing the accuracy of crop insurance assessments.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a platform designed to store and manage crucial agricultural data, including farmer details, farm locations, and crop information.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) uses advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote sensing to assist in informed agricultural decision-making.  All three pairs accurately reflect the functions and objectives of the technologies and platforms mentioned. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**9.  With reference to  Indian Railway Safety, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/System                      Objective/Feature
    1. Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) :  A fund for upgrading railway safety infrastructure
    2. Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches : Considered safer than older ICF coaches
    3. KAVACH System                         : An indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) is a dedicated fund established to enhance railway safety infrastructure through upgrades and improvements. Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches are designed with advanced safety features, making them safer than older Integral Coach Factory (ICF) coaches. The KAVACH system is an indigenously developed Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system that enhances train safety by preventing collisions and derailments.  Therefore, all three pairs correctly represent the initiatives and their respective roles in improving Indian railway safety. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**10. With reference to Indian Public Financial Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                             Characteristic/Function
    1. National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) : Notified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI)
    2. NaBFID                                   :  Established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021
    3. Public Financial Institution (PFI)       : At least 51% paid-up share capital held by central or state government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) has been officially notified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013. NaBFID was established through the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, to provide long-term infrastructure financing.  The definition of a Public Financial Institution (PFI) requires that at least 51% of its paid-up share capital is held by the central or state government.  All three pairs accurately reflect the characteristics and functions of NaBFID and PFIs in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Key Feature
1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                         :   Target of 1 million tons seaweed production by 2025
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) :  Focuses solely on inland fisheries infrastructure
3. Rangeen Machhli app                               :   Provides information on ornamental fish species in only four Indian languages
4. National Fisheries Development Program Portal     :  Operates independently of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana indeed aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, a key objective outlined in the provided text.

Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.  While FIDF does aim to create fisheries infrastructure, the statement that it *solely* focuses on inland fisheries is inaccurate. The text explicitly mentions that FIDF supports infrastructure in *both* marine and inland fisheries sectors. This is a crucial detail that differentiates it from other schemes.

Pair 3 is incorrectly matched. The Rangeen Machhli app offers multilingual information in eight Indian languages, not just four, demonstrating a broader reach than stated in the incorrect option. This highlights the importance of carefully examining the details provided in the source material.

Pair 4 is correctly matched.  The National Fisheries Development Program Portal is indeed created under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana, a sub-scheme under PMMSY, as stated in the given text.


**2. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                            Category
1.  Paddy                                          :   Rabi crop
2.  Rapeseed/Mustard                               :   Kharif crop
3.  Masur (Lentil)                                 :   Rabi crop
4.  Cotton                                          :   Commercial crop


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Paddy is a Kharif crop, harvested during the monsoon season, not a Rabi crop.  This highlights the importance of understanding the seasonal classifications of crops in Indian agriculture.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Rapeseed/Mustard is a Rabi crop, sown in winter and harvested in spring, not a Kharif crop.  This demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of crop cycles.

Pair 3 is correct. Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts typically form on seamounts, and the Lakshadweep Sea is an area where such formations are found.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Lime mud is found within the EEZ off Gujarat & Maharashtra coasts, not the Eastern Continental margins. This emphasizes the importance of precise geographical knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   WTO Agreement                                      Key Feature
1. Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)                   :   Elimination of export subsidies by developed members
2. WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package) :  Curbing harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion
3. OECD Global Minimum Tax                          :   Mandates a minimum 15% tax rate on corporate profits
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in Marrakesh in 1994, included provisions for tariff reductions, market access improvements, and the eventual elimination of export subsidies.  While the complete phase-out was a phased process, the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 solidified the commitment of developed countries to eliminate these subsidies.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, adopted in 2022 at the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva, specifically aims to curb harmful fishing subsidies that contribute to the depletion of global fish stocks.  This directly addresses the overfishing problem and promotes sustainable fisheries management.  Hence, pair 2 is correct.

The OECD Global Minimum Tax, based on the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules, is designed to prevent multinational corporations (MNCs) from engaging in profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions.  It mandates a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on corporate profits, thereby leveling the playing field and ensuring fairer tax contributions across different countries.  This makes pair 3 correct.

All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective agreements.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mechanism                                          Purpose
1. Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)                  :   Resolves transfer pricing disputes
2. Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)                 :   Prevents transfer pricing disputes for future years
3. UN Global Tax Treaty                              :   Establishes a minimum global corporate tax rate
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MAP, as a mechanism within tax treaties, specifically addresses already existing double taxation disputes, particularly those concerning transfer pricing.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. APAs, on the other hand, are proactive measures designed to prevent future transfer pricing disputes by establishing pre-agreed pricing methods between tax authorities and taxpayers. This makes pair 2 correct.  

The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to create a more equitable and effective international tax system but doesn't focus on setting a specific minimum global corporate tax rate. That is the role of initiatives like the OECD Global Minimum Tax.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  Option (b) is the correct answer because it accurately reflects the purposes of MAP and APAs. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Mormugao Port in Goa was indeed the first Indian port to introduce the Green Ship Incentives under the Harit Shrey scheme. This initiative aligns with global efforts towards decarbonization and green shipping, incentivizing ships with favorable Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While Mumbai Port is the largest natural harbor in India, Kolkata Port (now Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port) is the only major riverine port.  The question attempts to confuse the examinee by combining characteristics of two different ports.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) in Tamil Nadu holds the distinction of being the only corporatized port registered as a company, not Vadhvan Port. Vadhvan Port is a newly developed major port. This incorrect pairing uses a similar concept (a specific type of port) as a distractor.

Pair 4 is incorrect.  As explained above, Kolkata Port is the only major riverine port in India, not Mumbai Port which is a natural harbor. This incorrect pairing uses a similar concept (a specific type of port) as a distractor.  The question tests the knowledge of specific port characteristics and avoids easily guessable answers.


**2. With reference to global and national initiatives related to fisheries and subsidies, consider the following pairs:**

NABARD's Sanrakshan subsidiary does extend AIF credit guarantee coverage to Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), making statement 2 correct.  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) indeed operate on a mutual benefit basis, receiving deposits from and lending to their members only, making statement 3 correct. Option (c) accurately reflects that only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect regulatory body in statement 1 acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's specific knowledge of financial institutions and their regulatory frameworks. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between related yet distinct financial institutions and their functions.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                       Key Provision/Feature

2.  Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2007 :   Established e-NWRs (Electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts)
3.  BIS Act, 2016                                  :   Introduced the Eco Mark


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees *collective*, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge, making statement 1 incorrect. The Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2007, led to the establishment of e-NWRs, making statement 2 correct. The BIS Act, 2016, established the framework under which the Eco Mark operates for environmentally friendly products, making statement 3 correct. Option (c) correctly identifies statements 2 and 3 as correctly matched. The incorrect phrasing in statement 1,  "individual rights," serves as an effective distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of legal terminology and the nuances of intellectual property rights.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall, attention to detail in legal provisions, and the ability to differentiate between similar concepts.

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Indian government has planned 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) with a substantial investment outlay of $6.2 billion.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases. Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), crucial for enhancing rail freight traffic, are managed by DFCCIL, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) focuses on improving the efficiency of freight transport.  Finally, PM GatiShakti leverages technological advancements by integrating data from various sources, including ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps, for comprehensive infrastructure planning.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

4.  National CoE for AVGC-XR                 :   Set up as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013
5. Project Nexus                               : Connects IPS of four ASEAN countries and India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. Vadhvan Port, India's 13th major port, is indeed located near Dahanu in Maharashtra's Palghar district. The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) is a multilateral partnership explicitly designed to support Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, successfully replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). The National Centre of Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR) is structured as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013. Finally, Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative, aims to interconnect Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across India and four ASEAN nations (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand).  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of all pairs.


**3. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                           Key Aspect/Implementation Detail
1.  Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) :  Agreement with Russia
2.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for UCBs :  Replaces the Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)
3.  Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)     :  Significant challenge for the Indian economy
4.  Agricultural Export Policy, 2018          :  Target of $60 billion agricultural exports by 2022
5.  TRIPS Agreement                          :  Incorporated provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key aspect of the respective Indian economic policy or initiative.  RELOS indeed involves an agreement with Russia to facilitate logistics access. The PCA framework for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) replaced the SAF. Sluggish growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is a recognized challenge. The Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022. Finally, the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement incorporates elements from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.  Therefore, option (c) correctly identifies all correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Initiative    Key Characteristic/Component
1.  India Stack                                  :   Includes Aadhaar, UPI, and DigiLocker
2.  One Future Alliance                           :   Aims to build capacity for DPI in LMICs

4.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)             :   Developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)
5.  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology) : Uses RISAT-1A and VEDAS


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  India Stack is accurately described as encompassing Aadhaar, UPI, and DigiLocker. The One Future Alliance focuses on assisting low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in DPI implementation. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was indeed launched at the 2023 G20 virtual leaders' summit.  The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). Finally, KISAN utilizes RISAT-1A and the Visualization of Earth observation Data and Archival System (VEDAS) for crop insurance.  Therefore, only option (c) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to agricultural initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Key Feature/Technology
1.  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)         :   India's first data exchange platform for farmer services
2.  Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) : Uses artificial intelligence and remote sensing
3.  Minimum Support Price (MSP)                :  Covers 22 crops, including wheat, paddy, and cotton
4.  Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme: Total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore
5.  Gau Chip                                  : Developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. ADeX is indeed India's first data exchange platform for farmer services. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes technologies like artificial intelligence and remote sensing.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism covers 22 crops, including the examples mentioned. The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme received a cabinet approval with the stated outlay.  The Gau Chip for cattle was developed by the specified department.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Characteristic
1. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) : Registered with RBI as a Type I NBFC-ND
2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     :  Oversees the winding-up process of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)
3.  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)                 :  All UCBs, except those under All Inclusive Directions (AID), are subject to the PCA framework from April 1, 2025.
4. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework        : Implemented for tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 UCBs only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the information provided in the text.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does indeed have oversight of the management, governance, and winding-up processes of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).  The new Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, effective from April 1, 2025, is explicitly stated to apply to all UCBs except those under All Inclusive Directions (AID). This encompasses UCBs across tiers 2, 3, and 4.

Option (a) is incorrect because NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds and interact directly with customers, which accurately describes NUCFDC's role.

Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes pair 3.  While pair 3 is correct, pair 2 is also a correctly matched pair.

Option (d) is incorrect because pair 4 is false. The PCA framework applies to UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, not just tier 1, 2, and 3.  The text explicitly excludes only those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                           Focus Area
1. National Technical Textiles Mission            :  Promoting the use of technical textiles in the infrastructure sector
2. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles :  Developing the domestic technical textile industry
3. PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks (MITRA) Scheme :  Boosting exports of ready-made garments
4. Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP)     :  Facilitating the development of specialized textile clusters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the given information. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme aims to boost domestic manufacturing and competitiveness in the textiles sector, including technical textiles.  The Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP) focuses on developing infrastructure and creating specialized textile clusters to enhance efficiency and competitiveness.

Option (a) is incorrect. While the National Technical Textiles Mission aims to make India a global leader, the provided text does not specify infrastructure as a primary focus.  The mission's scope is broader.

Option (b) is incorrect. Although the PLI scheme is correctly matched, the MITRA scheme's primary goal is not solely export-oriented; it aims for comprehensive textile region development.

Option (d) is incorrect.  As explained above, pairs 1 and 3 are not entirely accurate in their stated focus areas.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Indicator                               Description
1. Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)             : Includes sectors such as Automobiles and Pharmaceuticals
2. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)           :  Represents the total investment in infrastructure projects by the government
3.  Index of Industrial Production (IIP)           :  ICI constitutes 40.27% of the IIP's weight
4.  Petroleum Refinery Products                   : Highest weighted component in the ICI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The ICI does indeed constitute 40.27% of the weight of items in the IIP.  Petroleum refinery products are correctly identified as the highest weighted component within the ICI.

Option (a) is incorrect. The ICI comprises Fertilizers, Cement, Natural Gas, Crude Oil, Coal, Electricity, Steel, and Petroleum Refinery Products; it does not include Automobiles or Pharmaceuticals.

Option (c) is incorrect. While pair 3 is correctly matched, pair 2 is not. GFCF represents total investment in fixed assets, not solely government infrastructure investment.  Private investment is a significant component.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 1 and 2, as explained above.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Function/Characteristic
1. World Trade Organization (WTO)                   :  Administers the TRIPS Agreement
2.  Council for TRIPS                               :  Handles disputes related to the TRIPS Agreement
3.  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) :  Developed the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge
4.  Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement       :  Restricts the use of compulsory licensing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The WTO administers the TRIPS Agreement, the Council for TRIPS is the forum for discussing TRIPS-related issues, and WIPO adopted the treaty mentioned.  These are all accurate pairings.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 2.

Option (b) is incorrect; the Doha Declaration affirms the right to use flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, including compulsory licensing, for public health purposes; it doesn't restrict its use.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of pair 4, as explained above.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                     Key Feature
1.  Companies Act, 2013                              : Defines and regulates Nidhi companies
2.  Nidhi Rules, 2014                               :  Specifies that Nidhi companies must have at least 500 members.
3.  Geographical Indications Act, 1999               :  Protects traditional knowledge related to agricultural products only.
4.  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Act, 2016       : Oversees the issuance of Eco Mark and Hallmark certifications.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because pairs 1 and 4 are accurately matched. The Companies Act, 2013, provides the legal framework for Nidhi companies, and the BIS Act, 2016, establishes the BIS's authority to issue Eco Mark and Hallmark certifications.

Option (b) is incorrect. While the Geographical Indications Act protects traditional knowledge, it is not limited to agricultural products.  Additionally, Nidhi Rules, 2014, specify a minimum of 200 members, not 500.

Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pair 4.

Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracies in pairs 2 and 3, as explained above.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Institution/Body                       Role/Function
1.  IFSC Authority                                  : Regulates financial institutions in International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) only
2.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :  Regulates Venture Capital Funds (VCFs)
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                     :  Accredits all Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) as External Credit Assessment Institutions
4.  Bank for International Settlements (BIS)        :  Established Project Nexus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. SEBI does indeed regulate Venture Capital Funds, and the BIS is the institution that conceptualized Project Nexus.

Option (a) is incorrect; RBI does not accredit *all* CRAs.  Brickwork Ratings is an exception.

Option (b) is incorrect because pair 2 is also correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 1 and 3, as explained above.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                 Objective
1. PM GatiShakti National Master Plan             : To improve the efficiency of logistics infrastructure
2.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)           : To generate investment through the privatization of public assets
3.  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                     : To replace the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) for funding telecom schemes in urban areas
4.  Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)           : To assist Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in using trade for economic development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). PM GatiShakti aims to improve logistics efficiency; the NMP seeks to monetize government assets to generate investment; and the EIF assists LDCs in using trade for growth. These are all accurate.

Option (a) is incorrect because pair 2 is also correctly matched.

Option (b) is incorrect because pair 1 and 4 are also correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect. The DBN funds telecom schemes in underserved rural and remote areas, not exclusively urban areas.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Organization                         Location/Headquarter
1.  International Energy Agency (IEA)          :  Vienna, Austria
2.  African Union (AU)                          :  Durban, South Africa
3.  International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC): Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
4.  World Gold Council (WGC)                   :  Basel, Switzerland


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The International Energy Agency (IEA) is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.

Option (b) is incorrect. The AU's headquarters is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, not Durban, South Africa.  Durban hosted a formal launch event.

Option (c) is incorrect.  The WGC's location is not specified in the provided text.

Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in pairs 2, 3, and 4.


**1. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Initiative                     Description/Feature
1. Project Nexus                             :   A bilateral initiative connecting India's UPI with ASEAN payment systems.
2. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) : A Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
3. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs :  Applies only to UCBs in tier 1 category.
4.  Small Finance Banks (SFBs) transitioning to Universal Banks : Requires a minimum net worth of Rs. 500 crore.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative aiming to interlink domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across multiple countries, including India and several ASEAN nations.  This makes option 1 correct.  NUCFDC is indeed an umbrella organization and acts as an SRO for UCBs, making option 2 correct. The PCA framework for UCBs applies to tier 2, 3, and 4 UCBs, excluding those under All Inclusive Directions (AID), thus making option 3 incorrect.  The eligibility criteria for SFBs to transition into Universal Banks necessitates a minimum net worth of Rs. 1000 crore, not Rs. 500 crore, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between slightly similar but incorrect details.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the nuances of each initiative.


**2. With reference to  Regulatory Bodies and Initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Regulation                     Characteristic/Function
1. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)            : Regulates and supervises NaBFID as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI).
2. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :  Governs Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) under SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 2000.
3.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) :  Was incorporated under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2008.
4.  Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL)  :  Is regulated by the Ministry of Finance.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RBI does regulate and supervise NaBFID as an AIFI under sections 45L and 45N of the RBI Act, 1934. SEBI governs VCFs under SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, not 2000.  NPCI was incorporated in 2008 under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. FBIL is regulated by the RBI, not the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of regulatory frameworks in India. The incorrect options provide plausible distractors that could mislead candidates lacking precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to  Financial Instruments and Markets, consider the following pairs:**

   Instrument/Concept                          Description/Feature
1. Perpetual Bonds                              :   Have a fixed maturity date.
2. Participatory Notes (P-Notes)                 :  Issued by unregistered foreign FPIs.
3.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)             :  Launched in 2017.
4.  Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs)          :  Exclusively uses the British pound.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Perpetual bonds, by definition, do not have a maturity date. P-Notes are issued by *registered* foreign FPIs. UPI was launched in 2016. ARRs offer a basket of currencies, not exclusively the British pound. All the pairs are incorrectly matched. This question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of financial instruments and their characteristics, highlighting the importance of precise definitions.


**4. With reference to  India's Economic Growth and Development, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator/Concept                           Data/Feature
1. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)      : Remained consistently above 20% of GDP since independence.
2.  India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) :  Includes only the identity and payment layers.
3.  E-commerce Market in India                :  Was worth $100 billion in 2022.
4.  Global Innovation Index (GII) ranking of India : Consistently higher than the IP Index ranking.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

GFCF has fluctuated significantly and was not consistently above 20% of GDP. India's DPI includes three layers: identity, payment, and data governance.  India's e-commerce market was worth $70 billion in 2022, not $100 billion. The GII and IP index rankings are different, and the provided statement does not reflect a consistent pattern. All the pairs are incorrectly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key economic indicators and their trends in India.  It emphasizes the importance of accurate data recall.

The MSP accurately covers the specified number and types of crops. The definition of a polycrisis as the simultaneous occurrence of multiple crises is correct. Gait analysis is correctly defined as the study of human motion patterns for identification. Disease X is accurately described as a hypothetical, unknown pathogen.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. This question tests the candidate's knowledge across various domains, including agriculture, economics, and public health, showing the interdisciplinary nature of the UPSC examination.  The ability to connect seemingly disparate concepts demonstrates a high level of understanding.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Technology/Initiative     Description
1.  KISAN                                 :  Crop insurance using space technology
2.  ADeX                                  :   India’s first data exchange platform for farmer services
3.  FASAL                                :  Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space technology
4.  Agri-Stack                             :  Provides real-time information on crop conditions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

KISAN correctly uses space technology for crop insurance. ADeX is accurately described as India's first data exchange platform for farmers.  FASAL correctly utilizes space technology for agricultural output forecasting.  However, Agri-Stack is a farmer-centric digital public infrastructure that streamlines services and scheme delivery, not a system providing real-time information on crop conditions; that would be a feature *within* Agri-Stack, not the overall description. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include an inaccurate pairing. Option (a) correctly identifies the three accurately matched pairs.  The question tests knowledge of specific Indian agricultural technology initiatives and their functions, showcasing the importance of understanding technological advancements in the agricultural sector for the UPSC exam.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Scheme/Initiative          Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) :  Loans categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with a 2024 budget enhancement to ₹20 lakh for Tarun Plus.
2. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY): Aims to boost fish production and productivity, improve technology, and strengthen the value chain.
3. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF): Focuses solely on creating infrastructure facilities in both marine and inland fisheries sectors.
4. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) facility   : Exclusively for providing credit to farmers involved in fisheries.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the key features of the respective schemes.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) indeed categorizes loans into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, and the 2024 budget did increase the loan limit for Tarun Plus.  PMMSY is a comprehensive scheme aiming to improve the entire fisheries value chain, from production to post-harvest infrastructure. The FIDF specifically targets the development of fisheries infrastructure.

Option (d) is incorrect because while Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) are used in agriculture,  they are not exclusively for fisheries.  KCCs provide credit for various agricultural activities, including but not limited to fisheries.  Therefore, associating KCC solely with fisheries is inaccurate. Options (a) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete, missing crucial correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Policy/Measure                      Description
1. Variable Rate Repo (VRR)              : A market-determined rate always lower than the repo rate.
2. Priority Sector Lending (PSL)          : Revised guidelines to promote small loans in disadvantaged districts.
3. Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio             : Represents the percentage of a bank's loans relative to its total deposits, with a December 2023 peak of 78.8%.
4. Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)    : A single-value index (0-100) capturing the extent of financial inclusion, with a March 2024 value of 64.2.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  The description of PSL accurately reflects the RBI's recent revisions. The CD ratio's description aligns with the provided data, showing its peak in December 2023 and its meaning. The FI-Index's description is also accurate, reflecting its purpose, scale, and the March 2024 value.

Option (d) is incorrect because the description of the Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is partially inaccurate. While VRR is a market-determined rate used to inject liquidity, it is not *always* lower than the repo rate; it's generally lower but not below the reverse repo rate.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, missing crucial correctly matched pairs.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term Related to NBFCs/Financial Institutions     Definition/Characteristic
1.  Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)       :  Cannot accept demand deposits.
2.  Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs     : Segregates NBFCs into four layers based on size, activity, and risk.
3.  Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) : Insures all bank deposits up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.
4.  Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)               :  Assets where the borrower has defaulted on contractual obligations.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. NBFCs are indeed distinct from banks in their inability to accept demand deposits. SBR for NBFCs accurately describes the tiered regulatory approach based on risk assessment. DICGC's role in insuring bank deposits up to ₹5 lakh is also accurate. Finally, the definition of NPAs correctly describes assets where borrowers have defaulted on their payments.  Therefore, all four pairs reflect accurate information, making option (d) the correct choice.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Steel Sector Challenge                       Specific Detail
1. Lack of Raw Material                     : India heavily relies on expensive Australian imports for coking coal.
2. Low Per Capita Consumption                : India's per capita finished steel consumption was lower than the global average in 2023-24.
3. Carbon Emission Intensity                  : The steel industry globally is the largest carbon-emitting manufacturing sector.
4.  Impact of Carbon Tax                    : Indian steel exports to the European Union face threats due to the imposition of a carbon tax.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The steel sector in India faces a significant challenge due to the dependence on expensive imported coking coal from Australia. The low per capita steel consumption in India compared to global averages is a well-documented fact. The steel industry's status as the largest carbon-emitting manufacturing sector globally is also widely acknowledged.  Finally, the imposition of a carbon tax by the European Union does pose a significant threat to Indian steel exports.  Therefore, option (c) correctly identifies all four correctly matched pairs.

3. Cobalt-rich Ferromanganese Crusts           : Crust-like deposits found on seamounts and underwater mountains.
4. Rare Earth Element (REE) Minerals          : Primarily found in deep-sea polymetallic nodules.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Polymetallic nodules are indeed rich in manganese and iron. Seafloor massive sulfides are formed near hydrothermal vents and contain valuable metals like copper, gold, silver, and zinc. Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts are accurately described as crust-like deposits found on seamounts. However, option 4 is incorrect. While rare earth elements can be found in deep-sea minerals,  they are not *primarily* found in polymetallic nodules; they have diverse locations in deep-sea environments. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Horticulture Initiative/Scheme                Key Feature
1. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) : Includes sub-schemes like the National Horticulture Mission.
2. Coordinated Programme on Horticulture Assessment and Management using geoinformatics (CHAMAN) : Uses remote sensing and GIS for better horticulture assessment.
3. Cluster Development Programme – SURAKSHA     : Provides instant disbursal of subsidies to farmers through e-RUPI vouchers.
4. National Horticulture Board (NHB)             : Primarily focuses on export promotion of horticultural products.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MIDH is accurately described as having sub-schemes, including the National Horticulture Mission. CHAMAN correctly uses remote sensing and GIS. SURAKSHA correctly uses e-RUPI vouchers for subsidy disbursement. However, the NHB's role is broader than just export promotion; while export promotion is a part of its activities, it also covers other aspects of horticultural development. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are completely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 4 is not fully accurate.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   RBI Related Scheme/Initiative                   Description
1. Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) : Launched in 2021 for resolving customer grievances.
2. Special Drawing Facility (SDF) Overdraft Facility : Availed by states against collateral like Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF).
3. Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio                       : A high ratio suggests that a significant portion of a bank's resources are allocated to loans.
4. Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)            : Published annually in July and includes Access, Usage, and Quality parameters.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The RB-IOS's description is accurate, highlighting its grievance redressal function. The SDF overdraft facility is correctly linked to state government access and collateral. The CD ratio's description accurately reflects its meaning and implications. Finally, the FI-Index description matches its publication frequency, parameters, and overall purpose. Therefore, all four pairs are accurate, making (d) the correct answer.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Microfinance in India              Detail
1.  First Microfinance Institution (MFI)           :  Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank, established in 1974.
2. Regulatory Body for MFIs in India             : Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
3. Malegam Committee (2010) Recommendation     : Framework for regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) – MFIs.
4. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)             :  Provides loans only to corporate entities engaged in farming.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs are correctly matched. SEWA Bank was indeed India's first MFI. The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs. The Malegam Committee did recommend a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs. However, statement 4 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to *non-corporate*, non-farm small/micro enterprises; it explicitly excludes corporate entities. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 4 is false.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Trade Agreement/Concept                 Feature
1.  Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) :  Sets minimum standards of protection for intellectual property.
2.  World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Procedures :  Applicable to disputes regarding TRIPS obligations.
3.  Council for TRIPS                           :  A forum where WTO members discuss issues relating to the TRIPS Agreement.
4.  Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement     :  Restricts the use of compulsory licensing for patented products.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs are correctly matched. TRIPS does set minimum standards for intellectual property protection.  The WTO's dispute settlement procedures are indeed used for resolving TRIPS-related disagreements. The Council for TRIPS serves as a discussion forum on TRIPS issues.  However, statement 4 is inaccurate. The Doha Declaration *affirmed* the right to use flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement, including compulsory licensing, for public health purposes; it did not restrict its use. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are correct, leading to option (a) as the correct answer. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 4.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    UCB Related Term/Concept                  Description
1.  Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability of UCBs: Key areas for monitoring the financial health of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) for UCBs  : Implemented if a UCB breaches risk thresholds.
3.  Exit from PCA                               : Requires no breaches in risk thresholds for four consecutive quarters.
4.  Financial Soundness of UCBs                 : Primarily determined by the volume of deposits held.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs accurately reflect aspects of UCB regulation and monitoring. Capital, asset quality, and profitability are indeed crucial indicators of UCB health. PCA is correctly associated with breaches of risk thresholds.  Exiting PCA does require consistent compliance over four quarters.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While deposit volume is a factor, it is not the *primary* determinant of a UCB's financial soundness; capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are equally or more important. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 4 is false.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Initiatives/Features
1.  Bank for International Settlements (BIS)   :   Unified Payments Interface (UPI)
2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Project Nexus
3.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :   Biotechnology Ignition Grant Scheme
4.  Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying: Gau Chip

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is not directly associated with UPI.  While the BIS Innovation Hub conceptualized Project Nexus, RBI's participation is key to its implementation in India.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates financial markets, not biotechnology initiatives. The Biotechnology Ignition Grant Scheme falls under the purview of the Department of Biotechnology.  Pair 3 is incorrect. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is indeed responsible for the development of the Gau Chip (a genomic chip for cattle). Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern the correct organizational linkages.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Policy                Focus Area
1.  National Food Security Mission (NFSM)     :   Jute Production
2.  Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) : Pulses Procurement
3.  Crop Diversification Programme (CDP)     :   Oilseeds Production
4.  National Biofuel Policy, 2018            : Biofuel Production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) primarily focuses on increasing the production of rice, wheat, and pulses, not jute.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  PM-AASHA does include a Price Support Scheme for pulses, making pair 2 correct. The Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) aims to diversify cropping patterns and increase oilseed production, making pair 3 correct. The National Biofuel Policy, 2018, directly targets biofuel production, making pair 4 correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. The question evaluates the candidate's understanding of Indian agricultural policies and their respective focuses.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                             Role/Activity
1.  Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) :  Commercial activities of ISRO
2.  Indian Space Association (ISpA)          :  Apex non-profit industry body for private space sector
3.  New Space India Limited (NSIL)           :  Public-private collaboration for space start-ups
4.  Department of Space (DoS)                :  Manages the Seed fund scheme (2023) for space tech

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

IN-SPACe's role is to promote and authorize private sector participation in space activities, not to handle the commercial activities of ISRO. That responsibility lies with NSIL. Pair 1 is incorrect. ISpA is indeed an apex non-profit industry body promoting the private space industry, making pair 2 correct. NSIL handles commercial activities related to space technology, but is not focused specifically on public-private collaborations for start-ups. However, its activities indirectly support this goal. Therefore, pair 3 is somewhat correct, but not a complete reflection of the organization’s main role.  DoS launched the Seed fund scheme (2023), making pair 4 correct. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of at least one pair. The question assesses knowledge about key organizations in India's space sector and their functions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Survey                                     Key Feature/Publisher
1.  Logistics Performance Index (LPI)              :   Released by S&P Global Market Intelligence
2.  Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)     :   Published by the World Bank Group
3.  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS): Measures Financial Inclusion through NAFINDEX
4.  Container Port Performance Index (CPPI)        :  Ranks countries based on trade logistics challenges


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The LPI is published by the World Bank Group, not S&P Global Market Intelligence. Pair 1 is incorrect. The MPI is indeed jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI, not the World Bank Group. Pair 2 is incorrect. NAFIS does use NAFINDEX to measure financial inclusion, making pair 3 correct. The CPPI ranks container ports based on performance, not countries based on trade logistics challenges. That is the function of the LPI. Pair 4 is incorrect.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. The question tests the knowledge of various indices and their publishers/features, requiring careful attention to detail.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Port/Port Authority                       Feature/Initiative
1.  Vadhvan Port                             :   India’s first port to introduce Green Ship Incentives
2.  Mormugao Port Authority                  :   Country's largest container port
3.  Bihar's first dry port (Bihta)           :   Located near Dahanu town in Palghar district
4.  Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI)    :   Manages Integrated Check Posts (ICPs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Vadhvan Port is planned as a large container port but is not the first to introduce Green Ship Incentives; that distinction belongs to Mormugao Port. Pair 1 is incorrect. Mormugao Port Authority is known for its Green Ship Incentives, not for being the country's largest container port. Pair 2 is incorrect. Bihar's first dry port is in Bihta, but it is not located in Palghar. Pair 3 is incorrect. The LPAI is responsible for managing ICPs, making pair 4 correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. The question assesses knowledge of India's port sector and related infrastructure.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Key Feature

2. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                  :   Focuses on indigenous bovine breed conservation
3. National Animal Disease Control Program  :   Aims to eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease
4. Digital Crop Survey                       :   Uses RISAT-1A satellite data

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan leverages the Digital Master Planning tool developed by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG-N).  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission is explicitly aimed at the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds in India. The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) has a primary goal of controlling and eradicating Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis. Finally, the Digital Crop Survey, a component of the Agri Stack, utilizes data from the RISAT-1A satellite to facilitate digital crop estimation.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the accurate response.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                          Funding Source/Implementing Entity
1. Pandemic Fund Project                    :   G20 Pandemic Fund
2. Digital Bharat Nidhi                     :   Telecommunications Act, 2023
3. Sustainable Livestock Health Scheme    :   Cabinet approval, Rs 1,702 crore outlay
4. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                :   Targets 1 million tons of seaweed production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pandemic Fund Project is indeed funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund. The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023.  The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production scheme received cabinet approval and has a total outlay of Rs 1,702 crore. However, the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana's target of 1 million tons of seaweed production is a goal, not its funding source, making this pair incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inclusion of the inaccurate seaweed production pair. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                           Key Provision/Objective
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999       :   Guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge
2. Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge :   Aims to prevent erroneous patents
3. TRIPS Agreement                         :   Sets minimum standards for intellectual property protection
4.  Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001 :  Aligned with the Convention on Biodiversity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects collective rights related to traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge aims to enhance the patent system's efficacy and prevent the erroneous granting of patents. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection among WTO members.  The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, aligns with the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, aiming for fair and equitable benefit sharing.  Thus, option (d) is the correct answer, as it includes all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Indian livestock sector, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Objective/Feature
1. Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip')         :   Developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying
2. Indigenous sex-sorted technology        :   Reduces cost of producing female calves
3. National Animal Disease Control Program :   Aims to control Brucellosis
4. Rashtriya Gokul Mission                  :   Improves productivity of indigenous cattle breeds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Unified Genomic Chip, including the 'Gau Chip' for cattle and 'Mahish Chip' for buffalo, was indeed developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. Indigenous sex-sorted technology aims to lower the costs associated with producing only female calves. The National Animal Disease Control Program targets the control and eradication of several animal diseases, including Brucellosis.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on improving the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds.  Therefore, the correct option is (c), indicating that all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the correct number of matched pairs.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Wheat is a rabi crop for which the government fixes the Minimum Support Price (MSP). The MSP for copra is determined independently, not based on another crop.  The MSP for crops like paddy is announced before the sowing season begins. Pair 4 is incorrect; jute is included in the 22 crops covered by the MSP.  Therefore, only options (a) accurately reflects the correct matches. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrect pair 4.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

4. Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) : Released by the World Economic Forum

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Human Development Report (HDR) is indeed released annually by the UNDP, starting in 1990. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is a joint publication of the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). The Preston Curve was indeed first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975.  The Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) is released by the World Economic Forum.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that correctly identifies all the matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Agri Stack is a digital platform providing farmer-centric services, including information on crop conditions.  The Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) is used for soil profile mapping. ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) stores farmer identity data. However, pair 2 is incorrect.  While the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) uses remote sensing data, its primary function is not the Digital Crop Survey; that's a function of Agri Stack. Therefore, option (c) is the only correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Livestock Related Initiative/Issue                  Detail

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. APEDA does handle GI registration for Indian products internationally.  ICAR-NISA celebrated its centenary. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs. However, pair 2 is incorrect.  The National Accreditation Board, not the Central Silk Board, oversees the accreditation of Certification Bodies for organic exports.  Therefore, option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Concept                                   Description
1.  Middle Income Trap                             : Stagnation at middle-income levels, failing to become high-income
2.  Creative Destruction                           : Process of new innovations replacing outdated industries
3.  Cobweb Phenomenon                            : Cyclical price fluctuations in certain goods
4.  Crowding Out                                   : Increased government spending reducing private investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The middle-income trap describes the economic stagnation of countries at middle-income levels. Creative destruction is the process where new innovations replace older industries. The cobweb phenomenon is characterized by cyclical price fluctuations. Crowding out occurs when increased government spending reduces private sector investment. Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, as it includes all the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                        Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Human Development Index (HDI)           :   Developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)            :   Measures gender inequalities in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market
3. Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) : Accounts for planetary pressures in the Anthropocene

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The HDI was indeed developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq and is a core component of the Human Development Report (HDR) published annually by the UNDP since 1990. The GII accurately measures gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  However, the IHDI does *not* account for planetary pressures; it measures the loss in HDI due to inequality. A separate index, the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI, considers environmental factors. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes a mismatched pair (3). Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason. Option (a) is incomplete as it omits a correctly matched pair. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar indices related to human development.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Type                                      Characteristic
1. Inheritance Tax                           :   Levied on the total value of a deceased person's estate
2. Gift Tax                                   :   Any gifts exceeding Rs 50,000 in a financial year are added to income from other sources
3. Wealth Tax                               :   Currently not imposed in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Inheritance tax is distinct from estate tax, although both relate to the transfer of wealth after death. Estate tax is levied on the total value of a deceased person's estate, while inheritance tax focuses on the amount received by individual heirs. Pair 2 is correctly matched.  In India, gifts received exceeding Rs 50,000 in a financial year are treated as "income from other sources" for tax purposes. Pair 3 is also correct. Wealth tax, similar to estate duty and gift tax, was abolished in India in 2015.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall of tax systems and their characteristics in India, requiring the candidate to differentiate between similar tax types.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                   Key Finding/Characteristic
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024: India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty
2. Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2024: India ranked higher than Nepal and Sri Lanka
3.  India's Innovation Index 2024             :   India's position remained unchanged at 42


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index report correctly indicated that India had the largest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty. The India's Innovation Index ranking is also correctly stated.  Pair 2, however, is incorrect. The Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2024 placed India lower in ranking than both Nepal and Sri Lanka. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall of specific data from development indices and reports, highlighting the importance of precise information retrieval.

Pair 2 is also incorrect; the National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to promote green hydrogen usage across various sectors, including steelmaking, but its primary focus isn't metal scrapping.  Pair 3 is correctly matched; the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund provides medium-to-long-term debt financing for post-harvest management infrastructure and other agricultural assets.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question assesses the understanding of different government initiatives and their specific areas of focus, requiring the candidate to differentiate between closely related policies.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                          Key Function/Role
1.  Jute Corporation of India (JCI)              :   Enacted the Jute Packaging Materials Act
2.  NABARD's All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS): Measures Financial Inclusion using NAFINDEX
3.  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS): Regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. While JCI is involved in supporting the jute industry, the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, was not enacted by JCI but is a separate piece of legislation. Pair 2 is correctly matched. NAFIS does indeed use the NAFINDEX to measure financial inclusion in rural areas. Pair 3 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by State Registrars of Cooperative Societies; they are not regulated by the RBI. Therefore, only pairs 2 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of various organizations and their roles in specific sectors, requiring careful understanding of their functions and regulatory frameworks.

2. International Monetary Fund (IMF)               :   Provides financial support to countries hit by crises
3. Extended Fund Facility (EFF)                    :   Lends for specific projects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Bretton Woods Conference led to the creation of the IMF and the World Bank, not the WTO (which was established later). Pair 2 is correctly matched. The IMF's core function is providing financial assistance to countries facing economic crises.  Pair 3 is incorrect. The EFF, a lending facility of the IMF, does *not* lend for specific projects; it supports comprehensive economic programs aimed at addressing balance-of-payments problems.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of international financial institutions and their roles, requiring precise knowledge of their functions and lending mechanisms.

2.  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)           :   Signs Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
3.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee: Evaluates central sector PPP projects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The CCI is itself appointed by the Central Government, not the other way around.  Pair 2 is correctly matched. The CBDT is responsible for signing APAs with Indian taxpayers. Pair 3 is also correctly matched. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee indeed evaluates central sector PPP projects.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of governmental bodies and their responsibilities within the Indian economic and regulatory framework, requiring precise understanding of their distinct roles.

1. Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)             :   Average proportion of deprivations experienced by multidimensionally poor individuals
2. Headcount Ratio (in the context of MPI)        :   Share of population living below the poverty line
3. Intensity of Poverty (A)                         :   Reflects multiple deprivations in education, health, and living standards

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the second and third pairs are correctly matched. The Headcount Ratio in the context of the MPI indicates the percentage of the population below the poverty line. The Intensity of Poverty (A) reflects the average deprivation experienced by those identified as multidimensionally poor. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) itself is a composite index encompassing multiple deprivations, not solely the average proportion of deprivations.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect, demonstrating the need for a clear understanding of the components and calculations within the MPI framework.


**1. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Act                                     Key Feature
1. Geographical Indications Act, 1999           :   Protects Collective rights over traditional knowledge

3.  Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)         :  Signed highest ever record 125 in FY 2023-24
4. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                   :   Targets 1 million ton seaweed production per year by 2025

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, explicitly aims to protect the collective rights of producers over traditional knowledge associated with specific goods. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) had a stated target of generating ₹6 lakh crore through the monetization of government assets between FY22 and FY25. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) reported a record number of Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) signed in FY 2023-24. Finally, the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has a stated goal of achieving 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.

(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 and 3 only.  Lime mud deposits are found off the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts, not the Andaman Sea (incorrect in pair 1). Heavy mineral placers are indeed found off the coast of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra (correct in pair 2). Phosphorite deposits exist along both the eastern and western continental margins of India (correct in pair 3). Polymetallic Ferromanganese nodules are primarily located in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not off the Kerala coast (incorrect in pair 4).  The question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific offshore mineral deposits in India.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings based on the actual locations of these mineral resources, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of geographical distribution in UPSC-style questions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options makes this a challenging question for the candidate, demanding detailed knowledge beyond general awareness.

Statement                                 Description
1.  Applies to all minerals.              :  Includes mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2. Uses UNFC and CRIRSCO standards. :  Employs a modified version of these frameworks.
3. Mandates exploration standards.      :  Focuses solely on deep-sea minerals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. Statement 1 is incorrect because the rules explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  Statement 2 is correct; the rules utilize a modified version of the UNFC and CRIRSCO standards for exploration stages and feasibility studies. Statement 3 is partially correct in that it mandates rigorous exploration standards, but it's too narrow. The rules apply to a broad range of minerals, not solely deep-sea minerals. Thus, only statement 2 accurately reflects the content of the rules.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific provisions and scope of the Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, requiring a precise understanding of the legal framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. Statement 1 is incorrect as the NLP 2022 addresses both hard and soft infrastructure aspects, including process reforms, digitization, and human resource development.  Statement 2 is correct; the NLP includes the Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP), encompassing eight key action areas for improving logistics efficiency. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the NLP aims to improve India's logistics performance, it doesn't specify a target LPI ranking or year. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a key feature of the NLP 2022. The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the National Logistics Policy and its comprehensive approach to improving India's logistics sector.  The inclusion of plausible distractors highlights the need for precise knowledge of policy details.

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, primarily permitted the auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities; the Revenue Sharing Model (RSM) is a separate concept introduced later (incorrect in pair 1). The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, did indeed allow composite prospecting license-cum-mining lease (PL-cum-ML) for coal (correct in pair 2).  The policy allowing 100% FDI in coal mining under the automatic route aimed at attracting foreign investment, not at enhancing transparency in license allocation (incorrect in pair 3). This question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific legislative and policy changes undertaken to improve the coal sector in India. The incorrect options are designed to test precise knowledge of policy details and avoid superficial understanding.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding India's digital public infrastructure (DPI):**

Statement                                       Description
1.  India Stack includes an identity layer.      :  Primarily uses the UPI payment system.
2.  One Future Alliance aims to build DPI capacity globally:  Focuses solely on high-income countries.
3.  Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is a focused institution:  Launched with a Social Impact Fund (SIF).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 3 only. Statement 1 is incorrect; while India Stack does include an identity layer (Aadhaar), it also encompasses payment and data governance layers, not solely relying on UPI. UPI is one component of the payment layer. Statement 2 is incorrect; the One Future Alliance aims to build capacity and provide support for DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries, not exclusively high-income countries. Statement 3 is correct; the Global DPI Repository is designed as a focused institution to accelerate DPI adoption globally, and it was indeed launched with a Social Impact Fund (SIF). This question assesses the candidate's understanding of India's DPI initiatives and their global implications.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, testing detailed knowledge of the initiatives.


**9. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following pairs:**

Entity                                     Specific Role/Feature
1.  NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL):  Developed UPI in 2016.
2.  National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI):  Partners with other countries to expand UPI.
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)              :  Incorporated NPCI in 2008.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 2 and 3 only.  NIPL is responsible for internationalizing UPI, not for developing it (incorrect in pair 1).  NPCI is indeed the organization that developed and operates UPI (correct in pair 2).  The RBI, along with the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), played a crucial role in incorporating NPCI in 2008 (correct in pair 3). This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the institutional framework and key players involved in the functioning and expansion of UPI, a crucial component of India's digital payment infrastructure. The incorrect pairing highlights the need for precise knowledge of the roles played by different entities.



**10. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 3 only.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the CCI was indeed established under the Competition Act, 2002, but it has a Chairperson and 6 other members, not 12. Statement 2 is partially correct; protecting consumer interests is one of the CCI's functions, but it also plays a broader role in promoting competition and preventing anti-competitive practices.  Statement 3 is correct; the Chairperson and 6 members of the CCI are appointed by the Central Government. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the composition and functions of the CCI, a crucial regulatory body in India's economy. The incorrect options emphasize the need for accurate knowledge of the CCI's structure and mandate.

    3. Krishi ICCC                               Employs remote sensing and GIS technologies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) leverages space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation. While AI might be a component of the analysis,  it's not the primary focus as stated in option 1.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct, but not entirely accurate in its description.

ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) holds three primary datasets: farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data.  Option 2 is incorrect as it only mentions farmer identity verification, neglecting the other crucial datasets.

Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes technologies like artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems for informed decision-making in agriculture. Option 3 accurately reflects this.  Therefore, only pairs 1 (partially) and 3 are correctly matched.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MSP covers 22 crops.  The breakdown is: 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (Jute and Copra).  Additionally, MSP is also fixed for Toria and de-husked coconut based on the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard, and copra respectively.  None of the provided options correctly reflect the actual number of crops under each category.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following pairs:**

    Parameter                                  Value/Feature
    1. Target for agricultural exports by 2022  : $50 billion
    2. Percentage decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 : 10%
    3. India's rank among global agri-exporters in 2022 : 8th


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The ambitious target set by India’s Agricultural Export Policy, 2018 was $60 billion by 2022, not $50 billion as stated in option 1. Agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline, not 10% as mentioned in option 2. India was ranked 9th, not 8th, among global agricultural exporters in 2022.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and its initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    BIS Standard/Mark                       Description/Application
    1. ISI Mark                                 Mandatory for all consumer goods sold in India
    2. Hallmark                                 Certifies the purity of precious metals
    3. Eco Mark                                 Labels products made from recycled materials


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ISI mark is mandatory for *certain* products in India, not all consumer goods as stated in option 1.  Hallmark is indeed an official guarantee of the purity or fineness of precious metal articles, making option 2 correct.  Eco Mark labels environmentally friendly products, not necessarily those made from recycled materials as stated in option 3. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**5.  With reference to the components of Household Savings in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Category of Savings                       Example
    1. Financial Savings                       Investment in gold and silver
    2. Physical Savings                        Deposits in banks
    3. Physical Savings                       Purchase of real estate


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Financial savings include currency, deposits, life insurance funds, etc.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect as investment in gold and silver falls under physical savings.  Pair 2 is incorrect as deposits in banks are financial savings, not physical savings. Pair 3 is correctly matched as purchase of real estate is considered physical savings.


**6. With reference to Goods and Services Tax (GST) and related concepts, consider the following pairs:**

    Term/Concept                              Description
    1. GST Compensation Cess                   Levied only on essential goods
    2. Luxury Goods                              Goods considered harmful to society
    3. Inverted Duty Structure                  Import duties on input goods are lower than on finished goods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

GST Compensation Cess was levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods to compensate states for revenue losses due to GST implementation.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Luxury goods are non-essential but highly desirable goods, not goods considered harmful to society as stated in option 2, which describes sin goods. Inverted Duty Structure occurs when import duties on input goods are *higher* than on finished goods, making statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to  India's tax treaties and agreements, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Initiative                       Key Feature
    1. OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS   Aims to prevent tax avoidance by small businesses
    2. Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) :  Governs tax payments on assets held in only one country
    3.  Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)        Mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is a global initiative to combat tax avoidance by *multinational enterprises (MNEs)*, not small businesses as stated in option 1.  DTAAs aim to avoid double taxation on the same asset in *two* different countries, making option 2 incorrect.  MAP is indeed a mechanism to resolve double taxation disputes, making option 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    CRA                                       Regulatory Oversight
    1. CRISIL                                  Solely regulated by SEBI
    2.  ICRA                                   Accreditation issued by RBI as an External Credit Assessment Institution
    3. Brickwork Ratings                       Not accredited by RBI as an External Credit Assessment Institution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While SEBI regulates CRAs, other agencies like RBI also have regulatory roles. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  ICRA, along with other CRAs except Brickwork Ratings, receives accreditation from RBI, making statement 2 correct.  Brickwork Ratings is indeed not accredited by RBI, making statement 3 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9.  With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature of InvITs                        Description
    1.  Type of Investment Vehicle            Similar to a hedge fund
    2.  Income Generation                     Primarily through dividends from government bonds
    3.  Sponsors                               Are borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

InvITs are similar to mutual funds, not hedge funds, making statement 1 incorrect. InvITs earn income through tolls, rents, interest, or dividends from their infrastructure investments, not primarily through government bonds as stated in option 2.  Sponsors of InvITs are indeed recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to Jute Production and related initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Act                                  Key Feature
    1. Jute I-CARE Project                        Focuses on reducing the use of jute packaging
    2. Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987        Mandates the use of jute for packaging certain commodities
    3. Jute Corporation of India (JCI)           Primarily involved in exporting jute products


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jute I-CARE project aims at mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting, not reducing the use of jute packaging as stated in option 1. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, indeed mandates the compulsory use of jute packaging material for certain commodities, making option 2 correct. JCI's main role is price support and not primarily exporting jute products as stated in option 3.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                    Characteristic/Association
1.  Microfinance Institutions                 :   Offer collateral-free loans up to ₹3,00,000 annual income households
2.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)    :   Loan limit enhanced to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) in 2024 budget
3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :   Regulatory body for MFIs in India
4.  Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank :   India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI)
5.  Malegam Committee                      :    Recommended framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs in 2010

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) indeed provide small-value, collateral-free loans primarily targeting low-income households, as defined by RBI guidelines with an annual income ceiling. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) did see its loan limit for the "Tarun Plus" category increased to ₹20 lakh in the 2024 Union Budget, building upon the existing Tarun category.  The RBI serves as the regulatory authority for MFIs operating within India. SEWA Bank holds the distinction of being India's pioneering MFI, established in 1974. Finally, the Malegam Committee, commissioned by the RBI, played a crucial role in formulating a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs in 2010, addressing the need for oversight and structured guidelines within the microfinance sector.  Therefore, all statements reflect accurate and verifiable information regarding the Indian microfinance landscape and its regulatory environment.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                   Characteristic/Association
1.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework:  Effective from April 1, 2025, for UCBs (excluding those under AID)
2.  Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)      : Replaced by PCA framework for UCBs
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC): Registered with RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND
4.  NUCFDC                                  :  Aims to raise capital (target Rs. 300 crores) for UCBs
5.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             : Oversees management, governance, and winding up of UCBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the factual information regarding the regulatory framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework was indeed implemented to replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF), enhancing the precision and flexibility of financial health monitoring for UCBs.  The NUCFDC is correctly identified as a Type II NBFC-ND registered with the RBI, functioning as an umbrella organization for UCBs. Its key objective includes raising capital to support UCBs, with a target of Rs. 300 crores.  Finally, the RBI's expanded purview over UCBs encompasses their management, governance, and winding-up processes, highlighting the central bank's role in maintaining the stability of the cooperative banking sector.  Thus, all the presented pairs accurately represent the relationship between the entities and their characteristics or associations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Characteristic/Association
1.  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) : Launched in 2021 under the Alternate Grievance Redress (AGR) Framework
2.  RB-IOS                                      : Covers all commercial banks, RRBs, and UCBs with deposits of ₹50 crore and above
3.  RB-IOS                                      : Aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints
4.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)        :  Published annually in July
5.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)        :  Ranges from 0 (complete exclusion) to 100 (full inclusion)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched. The Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) was indeed launched in 2021 as part of RBI’s Alternate Grievance Redressal (AGR) framework, aiming to efficiently resolve customer complaints.  Its coverage accurately includes commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), and urban cooperative banks (UCBs) meeting specific deposit size criteria.  The scheme's core objective is to offer cost-free redressal of customer grievances.  The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), as described, is published annually in July and uses a scale ranging from 0 to 100 to represent the spectrum of financial inclusion, where 0 signifies complete exclusion and 100 represents full inclusion.  Therefore, all the given pairs accurately reflect the characteristics and associations of the mentioned entities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                  Characteristic/Association
1.  Wilful defaulter                          :  Defaults with outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above
2.  Large defaulter                          : Default with outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above, suit filed, or account classified as doubtful/loss
3.  Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA)         :  Describes terms and allocation of collateral among common lenders in case of default
4.  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016 : Consolidates existing insolvency and bankruptcy frameworks
5.  National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited :  Resolves stressed assets above ₹500 crore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs accurately represent the characteristics and associations of the mentioned entities within the Indian financial system.  A wilful defaulter is correctly defined as a borrower who defaults on payments exceeding ₹25 lakh and displays specific indicators of intentional default. A large defaulter is appropriately characterized by an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore or more, along with the filing of a lawsuit or classification of the account as doubtful or a loss.  The Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) accurately describes its function in allocating collateral among multiple lenders in the event of a borrower's default. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, successfully consolidated existing insolvency and bankruptcy laws.  Finally, the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) is accurately identified as the entity tasked with resolving stressed assets exceeding ₹500 crore.  Therefore, all the given pairs represent accurate and verifiable information regarding their respective characteristics and associations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Characteristic/Association
1.  Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)   : Cannot accept demand deposits
2.  NBFC                                      : Does not participate in the payment and settlement system
3.  NBFC                                      : Deposit insurance not available through DICGC
4.  DICGC                                     : Insures bank deposits up to ₹5 lakh
5.  Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs : Segregates NBFCs into four layers based on size, activity, and risk


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are distinctly different from banks in that they cannot accept demand deposits, a core function of banks.  NBFCs also do not typically form part of the payment and settlement systems, unlike banks which facilitate check clearing and electronic payments. Deposit insurance coverage offered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) does not extend to depositors of NBFCs, unlike bank deposits.  DICGC does indeed insure bank deposits up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.  Finally, the Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs accurately implements a tiered system classifying NBFCs into four layers based on their size, activities, and risk profiles to tailor regulatory requirements.  Therefore, all the pairs accurately and comprehensively represent the characteristics and associations of the entities within the Indian financial regulatory framework.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme                                     Primary Focus
1. National Food Security Mission (NFSM)     :   Increasing oilseed production
2. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) : Price support for pulses
3. Crop Diversification Programme (CDP)      :   Promoting pulses in Green Revolution States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) primarily aims to increase the production of pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement, not oilseeds.  PM-AASHA indeed includes a price support scheme at Minimum Support Price (MSP) for oilseeds and pulses. The Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) focuses on diversifying crops, but its implementation within the Green Revolution States doesn't specifically target pulses exclusively.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because NFSM's primary focus is on pulses, not oilseeds. Option (c) is partially correct regarding PM-AASHA but incorrect about CDP's specific focus on pulses. Option (d) is incorrect because both statement 1 and 3 misrepresent the primary focus of the schemes.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of specific government schemes related to agriculture.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Jute-Related Entity                         Function/Characteristic
1. National Jute Board (NJB)                   :   Price support agency for jute
2. Jute Corporation of India (JCI)             :   Development of jute cultivation and marketing
3. Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987        :   Mandates jute packaging for all commodities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Jute Board (NJB) is responsible for the development of jute cultivation, manufacture, and marketing, not for price support. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) was indeed established as a price support agency. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging material for certain commodities, not all.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly matches the entity with its function. Option (a) is incorrect as NJB's function is misrepresented. Option (c) is partially correct regarding the Jute Packaging Materials Act but incorrect about NJB's function. Option (d) is incorrect as the function of the Jute Packaging Materials Act is partially incorrect. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the roles of different organizations within the jute industry.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Oilseed-Related Initiative                    Objective
1. National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) :  Expand oil palm cultivation to 10 lakh hectares by 2025-26
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)             :  Focus on seed components, production inputs, technology transfer
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)     :  Ensure MSP for oilseed farmers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NFSM-OS&OP focuses on seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer, not solely on expanding oil palm cultivation to a specific acreage. The NMEO-OP indeed aims to expand oil palm cultivation, although the exact target might vary.  PM-AASHA provides MSP support for oilseed farmers. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as NFSM-OS&OP's objective is misrepresented. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correct matching of PM-AASHA. Option (c) is partially correct regarding PM-AASHA but incorrect about NFSM-OS&OP's objective.  The question tests the understanding of various government initiatives related to oilseed production and the specific goals of each initiative.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Millet-Related Factor                        Reason for Stagnant Production
1. Yield gap                                      :   Shift in consumer preferences
2. Labor shortages                               :   Relatively shorter shelf life
3. MSP-backed procurement schemes for fine cereals :   Insufficient fertilizer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The yield gap in millet production is partly due to factors like labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer, but it's not directly linked to consumer preferences. Labor shortages do contribute to lower yields, and insufficient fertilizer also impacts productivity. MSP schemes for fine cereals divert resources and attention away from millets. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only partially explains the yield gap. Option (b) is incorrect as it ignores the impact of MSP schemes. Option (d) is partially correct regarding labor shortages but incorrect in attributing yield gaps solely to it and ignores the influence of MSP on fine cereals.  The question assesses understanding of the challenges faced by millet production and their causes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Export-Related Scheme          Characteristic
1. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) :   Focus on specific products and countries
2. Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme        :   Upgradation of export infrastructure
3. Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) Scheme :  Assistance for international freight


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

TIES focuses on improving trade infrastructure, not on specific products and countries. The MAI scheme indeed focuses on specific products and countries.  The TMA scheme provides assistance for international freight costs.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as TIES's characteristic is misrepresented. Option (b) is incorrect as it ignores the correct matching of MAI. Option (c) is partially correct regarding MAI but incorrect about TIES's characteristic.  The question tests knowledge of different schemes promoting agricultural exports and their features.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Organization/Initiative        Role/Function
1. APEDA                                       :  Oversees organic export certification
2. National Programme for Organic Production   :   Promotes agricultural exports
3. ICAR-National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA) :   GI registration for Indian products abroad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

APEDA serves as the secretariat to the National Accreditation Board, overseeing the accreditation of Certification Bodies for organic exports.  NPOP is a program focused on organic production, not on export promotion itself. APEDA handles GI registration, not NISA. Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect as it misrepresents APEDA's role. Option (c) is incorrect as it misrepresents both APEDA and NPOP's roles. Option (d) is incorrect as it misrepresents NISA's role. This question evaluates knowledge of various agricultural organizations and their functions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Technology Initiative             Key Feature
1. FASAL Project                               :   Digital Crop Survey
2. KISAN                                        :   Remote monitoring solution
3. Agri Stack                                   :   Provides real-time information on crop conditions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FASAL provides early forecasts of crop output, which informs the Digital Crop Survey but isn't its main feature. KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for crop insurance and yield estimation, not remote monitoring. Agri Stack is a farmer-centric digital platform containing farmer identity, geo-tagged farm location, and crop-sown data, enabling better real-time information on crop conditions. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it misrepresents FASAL's key feature. Option (b) is incorrect as it misrepresents KISAN's role. Option (d) is incorrect as it misrepresents both KISAN and Agri Stack's features.  The question tests the understanding of various agritech initiatives and their key functionalities.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Livestock Sector Issue                       Initiative to Address the Issue
1. High economic losses due to animal diseases  :   Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip')
2. Anti-Microbial Resistance                    :   Sustainable livestock health and production scheme
3. Low Productivity                             :   Rangeen Machhli app


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Unified Genomic Chip aims to improve animal health and productivity, indirectly addressing high economic losses. The Sustainable livestock health and production scheme directly tackles issues related to animal health and antimicrobial resistance. The Rangeen Machhli app focuses on ornamental fish, not on addressing low productivity in general livestock. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct matching of the sustainable livestock health scheme. Option (c) is incorrect as it misrepresents the focus of the Rangeen Machhli app. Option (d) is incorrect as it misrepresents the focus of the Rangeen Machhli app.  This question tests understanding of livestock sector challenges and the initiatives designed to address them.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Aquaculture Initiative                        Objective
1. PM Matsya Sampada Yojana                     :   Promote fisheries start-ups
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF):  Create fisheries infrastructure
3. Establishment of Incubation Centres          :   Target 1 million ton seaweed production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PMMSY is a broader scheme aiming to improve fish production and productivity, including infrastructure development and value chain strengthening, but not specifically start-ups. FIDF aims to create fisheries infrastructure. Incubation centers aim to promote fisheries start-ups, not seaweed production.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it misrepresents PMMSY's objective. Option (c) is incorrect as it misrepresents both PMMSY and Incubation Centers objectives. Option (d) is incorrect as it misrepresents Incubation Centers' objective.  This question tests the understanding of different aquaculture initiatives and their specific goals.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Agricultural Finance Initiative                 Characteristic
1. Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)        :   Interest subvention of 3% per annum
2. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC)                      :   Credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE
3. NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS) :   Measures Financial Inclusion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AIF provides loans with interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage. KCC provides credit facilities for farmers. NAFIS data is used to create NAFINDEX which measures financial inclusion in rural areas. Therefore, all three statements are correctly matched.  All options other than (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct matching. This question tests knowledge of different agricultural finance initiatives and their features.


**1. With reference to the regulation of Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body                     Specific Responsibility
    1. Reserve Bank of India             :   Regulation of management-related aspects such as incorporation and registration
    2. Registrar of Co-operative Societies:   Regulation of banking aspects such as capital adequacy and risk control
    3.  Reserve Bank of India             :   Supervising managerial, administrative, and other matters.
    4. Registrar of Co-operative Societies:  Supervising the banking functions under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) primarily regulates the banking aspects of cooperative banks, including capital adequacy, risk control, and lending norms, under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Banking Laws (Application to Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965.  Option 1 incorrectly assigns management-related responsibilities to the RBI.  The Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS) at the state or central government level is responsible for overseeing the management aspects of these banks, such as incorporation, registration, management, audit, and the supersession of the board of directors. Option 2 correctly reflects this. Option 3 is incorrect as the RBI does not supervise managerial, administrative matters of cooperative banks. Option 4 incorrectly assigns the supervision of banking functions to the RCS. Therefore, only pair 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) actions concerning Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following pairs:**

    RBI Action                                     Objective/Outcome
    1.  Issuing Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework:  To permit UCBs to open new branches without prior approval.
    2.  Asking UCBs to stop using Dividend Equalisation Funds (DEFs): To improve the financial health of UCBs with greater precision and flexibility.
    3.  Revision of NPA Provision Norms              : To allow UCBs to make payments from previously accumulated profits or reserves.
    4.  Giving RBI powers to supersede boards of UCBs: To address the practice of setting up DEFs which are against current rules.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's PCA framework aims to address the financial health of UCBs, not to ease branch expansion.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The RBI's directive to stop the use of DEFs is directly related to improving financial transparency and compliance with existing regulations, making pair 2 correct.  The revision of NPA provision norms is to better manage bad debts, not to permit payments from accumulated profits (which are prohibited). Hence, pair 3 is incorrect.  The RBI's power to supersede boards is a tool to enforce regulatory compliance, directly addressing issues like the misuse of DEFs, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and related regulatory measures, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Regulation                               Action/Focus
    1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                  :   Regulation of Chit Fund Companies
    2.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)        :   Buying NPAs from banks to clean up balance sheets
    3.  Ministry of Corporate Affairs                :  Regulating P2P lending platforms
    4.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                  :  Setting aside a prescribed amount from profits to cover probable losses (Provisioning)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI does not regulate Chit Fund Companies; that falls under the purview of State Governments. Thus, pair 1 is incorrect. ARCs are indeed involved in purchasing NPAs from banks to help them clean up their balance sheets, making pair 2 correct. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates Nidhi Companies, not P2P lending platforms which are regulated by the RBI. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. The RBI's role in provisioning for probable losses (setting aside funds to cover potential losses) is a core aspect of banking regulation, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Co-lending and related regulations, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Entity                         Specific Provision/Action
    1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Mandating a minimum 20% credit risk on NBFCs in co-lending arrangements
    2.  Finance Ministry                        :  Formation of a committee to tackle co-lending issues
    3.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Allowing banks to co-lend with NBFCs belonging to the promoter group
    4.  Co-lending arrangements                 :  Increasing lending capacity and reducing risk for individual lenders

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RBI's regulations for co-lending do indeed mandate a minimum 20% credit risk for NBFCs, making pair 1 correct. The Finance Ministry has taken the initiative to form a committee to address co-lending issues, making pair 2 correct. Banks are explicitly *not* allowed to co-lend with NBFCs from their promoter group, therefore pair 3 is incorrect. Co-lending arrangements are designed to increase lending capacity and reduce risk for individual lenders by sharing the risk and resources. This makes pair 4 correct. Therefore only pairs 1, 2 and 4 are correctly matched.



**5. With reference to  Financial Inclusion and related indices, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Parameter                        Description/Characteristic
    1. Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) :  Measures the extent of financial inclusion across the country using a scale of 0 to 100.
    2.  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS):  Published annually in July.
    3.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) :  Includes only banking sector data.
    4. NAFIS                                 : Offers a comprehensive overview of rural population's financial inclusion status.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The FI-Index accurately measures the extent of financial inclusion using a 0-100 scale, making pair 1 correct. NAFIS indeed provides a comprehensive overview of rural financial inclusion, including loans, insurance, and pensions, making pair 4 correct.  The FI-Index is not published annually in July; that is the publication time for the RBI's Financial Stability Report, therefore pair 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index incorporates data from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors, not just banking, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to  the regulation of  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and related schemes, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulatory Body/Scheme                    Specific Feature/Provision
    1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Categorization of MUDRA loans into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun
    2.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)     :  Provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.
    3.  Malegam Committee                      :  Recommended a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs.
    4.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)             :  Defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households with annual income up to ₹3,00,000.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs and is responsible for the categorization of MUDRA loans, making pair 1 correct. PMMY indeed provides loans up to ₹10 lakh (though the budget increased this limit later), making pair 2 correct. The Malegam Committee's recommendations directly relate to the regulation of NBFC-MFIs, making pair 3 correct. The RBI's definition of microfinance loans aligns with the provided description, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to  the  Debt Resolution Mechanisms, consider the following pairs:**

    Mechanism/Tribunal                      Jurisdiction/Function
    1.  National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT):  Appeals from Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)
    2.  Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs)          :  Appeals to the Supreme Court
    3.  Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP):  Resolution of stress for corporate MSMEs, initiated voluntarily by the debtor for defaults of at least ₹10 lakh.
    4.  Supreme Court                          :  Final appellate authority for NCLAT decisions.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NCLAT does handle appeals related to corporate insolvency, but not directly from DRTs.  Appeals from DRTs go to the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), making pair 1 incorrect.  DRTs do not directly appeal to the Supreme Court; their appeals go through the DRAT, making pair 2 incorrect. PPIRP is accurately described, making pair 3 correct. The Supreme Court is the final appellate authority for NCLAT decisions, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and related regulations, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Regulation                       Specific Role/Function
    1.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)        : Provide information on past debt repayments by borrowers
    2.  SEBI                                  : Primarily regulates Credit Rating Agencies in India
    3.  Credit Bureaus                         : Provide forward-looking opinions on the relative ability of an entity to meet its financial commitments
    4.  CareEdge                             : Became the first Indian CRA to enter the global scale ratings space


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CRAs provide forward-looking opinions on creditworthiness, not information on past repayments. That is the function of Credit Bureaus, therefore pair 1 is incorrect and pair 3 is incorrect. SEBI's role in regulating CRAs in India is accurate, making pair 2 correct. CareEdge's achievement of entering the global scale ratings space is also accurate, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                  Characteristic
1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Ombudsman  :  Tenure not exceeding three years
2.  Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs)   :  Registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC) :  Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND)
4.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework : Effective from April 1, 2025


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The RBI Ombudsman's tenure is capped at three years, as explicitly stated in the provided text.  Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs), according to the text, are mandated to be registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013,  a crucial aspect of their establishment and legal standing.  The NUCFDC is correctly identified as a Type II NBFC-ND, signifying its acceptance of public funds or customer interface. Finally, the implementation date of the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) is correctly stated as April 1, 2025.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A complete understanding of the regulatory framework governing financial institutions in India is necessary to answer this question correctly.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Financial Institution             Regulatory Oversight
1.  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)           :  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation (NUCFDC)
2.  Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
3.  Credit Information Companies (CICs)     :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
4.  Payment System Participants             :  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The text clearly indicates that NUCFDC acts as an umbrella organization and SRO for UCBs, establishing the first pair's accuracy. The RBI's regulatory role over NBFCs, CICs, and Payment System Participants is also explicitly mentioned, confirming the correctness of the remaining pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  Understanding the diverse regulatory landscape of the Indian financial sector and the roles of different organizations is crucial for correctly answering this question. This highlights the need for candidates to comprehend the intricate relationships between various financial entities and their respective regulators.


**3. With reference to the Indian financial sector, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                      Description
1.  Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)                :  Import duties on finished goods are higher than on input goods.
2.  Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG)             :  Taxation on capital gains from assets held for more than a year.
3.  Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index)        :  Measures the extent of financial inclusion across the country.
4.  Wilful Defaulter                             :  Outstanding amount below ₹25 lakh.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The description of LTCG accurately reflects its definition. The FI-Index's purpose of measuring financial inclusion is also correctly stated.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; an inverted duty structure occurs when import duties on input goods are *higher* than on finished goods, the opposite of what's described. Pair 4 is also incorrect; a wilful defaulter is defined as having an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and *above*.  Distinguishing between the correct and incorrect definitions requires a precise understanding of financial terminology. This question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar but distinct concepts within the Indian financial system.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                Feature
1.  Banking Regulation Act, 1949                :  Governs the functioning of ARCs.
2.  SARFAESI Act, 2002                         :  Enables the recovery of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).
3.  Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 :  Regulates Credit Rating Agencies.
4.  SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 :  Deals with the treatment of Wilful Defaulters.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, is fundamentally concerned with the recovery of NPAs and the establishment of ARCs. The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, directly regulates Credit Information Companies (CICs). Pair 1 is incorrect; while the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, is a significant piece of legislation governing banking, it doesn't specifically govern the functioning of ARCs.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the treatment of wilful defaulters is not primarily dealt with in the SEBI regulations for Credit Rating Agencies. This question highlights the need for candidates to know the specific mandates of different Indian financial regulations and avoid generalizations.


**5. With reference to the regulation of financial institutions in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Function
1.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)                :  Accredited by IRDA.
2.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                 :  Issues accreditation to CRAs as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
3.  Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) :  Registers Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs).
4.  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)             :  Issues ISI marks for stainless steel kitchen utensils.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The RBI's role in accrediting CRAs as External Credit Assessment Institutions is explicitly mentioned. SEBI's registration of InvITs is also confirmed.  The BIS's issuance of ISI marks is mentioned in relation to kitchen utensils.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; CRAs are not accredited by the IRDA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India). The correct regulatory body for CRAs is primarily SEBI and the RBI for specific purposes. This question demonstrates the need for candidates to have a detailed understanding of the regulatory functions of various Indian financial and standardization bodies.  The ability to accurately identify the roles of different agencies is key to answering this question correctly.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                      Characteristic/Association
1.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Ombudsman  :  Tenure exceeding three years
2.  Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs)   :  Registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013
3.  Credit Information Companies (CICs)    :  Regulated solely by the CIC Regulation Act, 2005
4.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) :  Prohibited from raising money through deposits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RBI Ombudsman has a tenure not exceeding three years, making statement 1 incorrect.  Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs), as per the provided text, are indeed set up as not-for-profit companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  This makes statement 2 correct. Credit Information Companies (CICs) are regulated by the CIC Regulation Act, 2005, *and* RBI guidelines, making statement 3 incorrect as it states *solely* by the Act.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) are explicitly prohibited from raising money through deposits, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify nuances in regulatory frameworks.  The distractors are designed to exploit potential misunderstandings regarding the regulatory bodies and their jurisdictions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of NBFC                                  Regulatory Body
1. Housing Finance Companies                  :  SEBI
2. Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Company : Reserve Bank of India
3. Chit Fund Companies                         :  State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Housing Finance Companies are regulated by the National Housing Bank, not SEBI.  Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Companies are regulated by SEBI, not the Reserve Bank of India. Chit Fund Companies are indeed regulated by State Governments. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The question tests factual recall of regulatory frameworks within the financial sector.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, requiring the candidate to possess precise knowledge of regulatory bodies and their respective jurisdictions. The difficulty stems from the need to accurately recall the regulatory body for each type of NBFC.


**3. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of PCA Framework                          Feature
1. Effective Date                                :  April 1, 2025
2.  Key Monitoring Areas                         : Capital, Asset Quality, and Liquidity
3.  Exemption from PCA                           : UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PCA framework for UCBs is indeed effective from April 1, 2025. Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability (not Liquidity) are the key monitoring areas. UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID) are exempted. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. The question tests detailed knowledge of the PCA framework and its implementation. Distractor 2 is designed to test for precise recall of the framework's elements.  The question necessitates a thorough understanding of the PCA framework's key components and its application to UCBs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act                                  Function/Feature
1.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Regulated by SEBI
2.  Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN)        :  Recognized as an SRO by RBI in 2014
3.  SHG-Bank Linkage Program                       :  Initiated by RBI in 1992


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NUCFDC is registered with RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not regulated by SEBI. MFIN was indeed recognized as an SRO by RBI in 2014. The SHG-Bank Linkage Program was initiated by NABARD, not RBI, in 1992. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question tests knowledge about various organizations and their roles in the Indian financial landscape.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's recall of specific details, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge.


**5. With reference to the RBI's surplus transfer to the government, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                          Provision/Recommendation
1.  Legal Mandate for Transfer                     :  Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934
2.  Committee recommending increased surplus transfer :  Bimal Jalan Committee
3.  Metric for determining surplus transfer        :  Realized Equity and Economic Capital (CGRA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Section 47 of the RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of RBI profits to the Centre. The Malegam Committee (not Bimal Jalan) also influenced increased surplus transfers. The Bimal Jalan Committee's recommendations did indeed involve Realized Equity and Economic Capital (CGRA) as metrics for determining surplus transfer. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the legal and policy aspects of RBI's surplus transfer mechanism.  The distractors use closely related committees and concepts to increase the difficulty level.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                         Characteristic
1.  InvITs                                        :  Recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002
2.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)                 :  All are RBI-accredited domestic CRAs
3.  Ways and Means Advances (WMA)               :  Available only to State Governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

InvIT sponsors are indeed recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. Not all CRAs are RBI-accredited domestic CRAs (Brickwork Ratings is an exception).  WMAs are also available to the Union Government. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests specific knowledge about different financial instruments and their regulatory aspects. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the exceptions and nuances within the rules.  The difficulty lies in recognizing the exceptions to general statements.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Definition/Characteristic
1.  Monetary Policy Transmission                 :  Process by which RBI rate changes impact the economy
2.  Expansionary Monetary Policy                 :  Increases interest rates to curb inflation
3.  Household Savings                             :  Categorized into financial and non-financial savings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Monetary policy transmission accurately describes the process by which RBI's policy rate changes affect economic variables.  Expansionary monetary policy *lowers* interest rates, not increases them. Household savings are indeed categorized into financial and non-financial components. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests understanding of core economic concepts and their definitions.  The distractor on expansionary monetary policy is designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of its core function.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                 Provision/Aspect
1.  Geographical Indications Act, 1999          :  Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge
2.  RBI Act, 1934                               :  Governs Special Drawing Facility (SDF) for States/UTs
3.  SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 :  Requires CRAs to disclose their rating criteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees *collective*, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge. The RBI Act, 1934, does govern the SDF for States/UTs.  The SEBI regulations for CRAs accurately mandate disclosure of rating criteria. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of specific acts and regulations and their key provisions.  The distractor on the Geographical Indications Act is designed to challenge the candidate's precise understanding of the act's scope.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature/Entity
1. Geographical Indications Act 1999          :   Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge
2. GST Council                                  :   Headed by the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry
3. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)       :   Targets ₹10 lakh crore over four years
4.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee :  Evaluates state-level PPP projects
5.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework  : Effective from April 1, 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees collective rights, not individual rights, over traditional knowledge.  This is a crucial distinction.  The GST Council is chaired by the Union Finance Minister, not the Minister of Commerce and Industry.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aimed for ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹10 lakh crore, over four years (FY22-FY25). The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not state-level ones. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) is indeed effective from April 1, 2025.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (d) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar but distinct concepts within the Indian economic policy landscape.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax/Duty                                      Characteristic/Governing Body
1. Excise Duty                                   :  Applies only to petroleum and liquor post-GST
2.  GST                                          :  A direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services
3.  Inverted Duty Structure (IDS)                 :  Import duties on finished goods are higher than on input goods
4.  Windfall Tax                                  :  Imposed on industries with below-average profits
5.  Duty Drawback                               :  Rebates customs duty on exported goods


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Excise duty, after the implementation of GST, applies only to petroleum and liquor, making statement 1 correct. GST is an indirect tax, not a direct tax, making statement 2 incorrect.  An inverted duty structure occurs when import duties on input goods are higher than on finished goods, making statement 3 incorrect. A windfall tax is levied on industries with significantly *above*-average profits, not below-average profits, making statement 4 incorrect.  A duty drawback does indeed rebate customs duty on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods, making statement 5 correct. Thus, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, highlighting the importance of precise understanding of tax policies in India. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in definitions and descriptions of economic policies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Policy                                  Function/Characteristic
1. RBI Ombudsman                                  :  Handles complaints related to housing finance companies
2.  Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs)         :  Required to be for-profit companies
3.  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :  Operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs
4.  Reserve Bank of India (RBI)                   :   Supervises Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) but not Payment System Participants
5.  Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)         :   Resolve assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The RBI Ombudsman handles complaints from various NBFCs, including those that accept deposits or have customer interfaces, but not specifically housing finance companies, making statement 1 incorrect. SROs are required to be not-for-profit, not for-profit, companies, making statement 2 incorrect. NUCFDC does indeed operate as an SRO for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), making statement 3 correct. The RBI does supervise NBFCs and Payment System Participants, making statement 4 incorrect. ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, to resolve assets, making statement 5 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of financial institutions and their regulatory frameworks in India, demanding precise recall of details and the ability to eliminate incorrect options based on subtle inaccuracies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Insolvency-related Entity/Process                       Description/Feature
1. Insolvency Professionals (IPs)                        : Regulated by Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs)
2.  Information Utilities (IUs)                          :  Manage insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy processes
3. Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) :  Available for defaults of at least ₹5 lakh
4.  National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)                :  Handles debt recovery cases for individuals
5.  Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT)                        :  Completes CIRP within 180 days


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Insolvency Professionals (IPs) are indeed regulated by Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs), making statement 1 correct. Information Utilities (IUs) collect and disseminate financial information, not manage insolvency processes, making statement 2 incorrect. PPIRP is available for defaults of at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹5 lakh, making statement 3 incorrect. NCLT handles CIRP and liquidation of corporate persons, not debt recovery cases for individuals, making statement 4 incorrect.  DRTs handle individual or partnership insolvency, but the 180-day timeline applies to NCLT for CIRP, making statement 5 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The question assesses detailed understanding of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in India, testing factual recall and understanding of the roles and functions of various entities within the IBC framework.  The distractors are carefully chosen to challenge the candidate's precise knowledge.

4.  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs: Replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF)
5.  Expansionary Monetary Policy                     :   Increases interest rates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Monetary policy aims at both sustainable economic growth and price stability, making statement 1 incorrect. Monetary policy transmission accurately describes the process by which RBI's decisions impact the economy, making statement 2 correct. The current flexible inflation targeting framework targets 4% CPI inflation, not 5%, making statement 3 incorrect.  The PCA framework for UCBs does replace the SAF, making statement 4 correct. An expansionary monetary policy *lowers*, not increases, interest rates, making statement 5 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of RBI's monetary policy framework, requiring precise understanding of the objectives and mechanisms of various policy instruments.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one pair
    (b) Only two pairs
    (c) Only three pairs
    (d) All four pairs

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides crucial financial assistance to countries facing economic crises and operates lending instruments like the General Resources Account (GRA) and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) has the explicit aim of significantly increasing the annual issuance of guarantees. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) specifically targets low-income countries, providing them with concessional financing.  The General Resources Account (GRA) is an IMF lending mechanism characterized by market-based interest rates.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.

    4. India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) :  Primarily supports private sector projects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each one:

1. **PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:** This is incorrect.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a comprehensive initiative driven by seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure. It's not solely focused on road infrastructure.

2. **National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):** This is incorrect. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not ₹10 lakh crore over five years.  The timeframe and target amount are both inaccurate in this pairing.

3. **Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF):**  This is incorrect.  The VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%, as a capital grant to enhance project viability.  The percentage offered is misrepresented.

4. **India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF):** This is incorrect. While the IIPDF aims to support the development of PPP projects, it doesn't *primarily* support private sector projects. Its purpose is to aid the development of quality PPP projects by providing necessary funding support to the *project sponsoring authorities*, which can include both public and private entities.  The statement oversimplifies the fund's scope.


The question tests factual recall and understanding of various Indian infrastructure initiatives. The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of each scheme's details.


**2. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Initiative                             Role/Function

    2. National Land Monetization Corporation   :   Monetizes assets of only state-level entities
    3. Vijay Kelkar Committee                    :   First proposed asset monetization in 2015
    4. Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT)    :   A mechanism solely for private sector investment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of asset monetization in India and its key players and mechanisms.

1. **National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):** Incorrect.  The NMP identifies 13 sectors for monetization, not just railways.  Roads, railways, power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom are major sectors, but it's not limited to just one.

2. **National Land Monetization Corporation:** Incorrect.  This corporation undertakes surplus land monetization of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and other government agencies, but it's not limited to state-level entities.  The scope is wrongly restricted.

3. **Vijay Kelkar Committee:** Incorrect. The Vijay Kelkar committee recommended asset monetization for the first time in 2012, not 2015.  The year is incorrect.

4. **Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT):** Incorrect. While InvITs are primarily used for infrastructure projects, they are a mechanism that *can* involve both public and private sector participation, not solely private sector investment.  The statement is too restrictive.



**3.  With reference to Industrial Parks in India, consider the following pairs:**

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Once again, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of India's industrial park development initiatives and related entities.

1. **NICDP:** Incorrect. The NICDP aims to develop industrial corridors across multiple states, not just southern states. The geographical limitation is false.

2. **NICDIT (National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust):** Incorrect. NICDIT, along with NICDC (National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited), is a *government* entity responsible for implementing the NICDP, not a private sector organization. The ownership is misrepresented.

3. **Sri City Special Economic Zone:** Incorrect. Sri City is located in Andhra Pradesh, not Gujarat. The state is incorrect.

4. **Union Budget 2024-25:** Incorrect. The Union Budget 2024-25 proposed the creation of *twelve*, not five, new industrial parks under the NICDP. The number is inaccurate.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, established the WTO, replacing GATT as the primary international trade body. This is a foundational fact in international trade governance.  The Agreement on Agriculture, a crucial part of the WTO framework, deals with various aspects of agricultural trade policies, including market access (tariffication, tariff reductions), domestic support (subsidies), and export subsidies.  The public stockholding (PSH) programs, used by many developing countries to procure and distribute food grains at minimum support prices (MSP), have been a point of contention within the WTO due to their potential to distort markets.  The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture acknowledges the need for food security but imposes de minimis limits on subsidies to prevent market distortion, with different thresholds for developed and developing countries.  All three pairs accurately reflect key aspects of WTO agreements and their related concepts.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.

Bharatmala Pariyojana is a significant road infrastructure project aiming to construct around 65,000 km of national highways, enhancing connectivity across India.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are a crucial component of India's efforts to modernize its rail network and significantly increase the share of freight transported by rail. The stated goal of increasing rail freight traffic share to 45% by 2030 is a publicly declared objective.  Therefore, all three pairs are accurately matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With respect to India's digital public infrastructure (DPI) and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Concept                         Feature/Characteristic
1. India Stack                               :   Comprises an identity layer, a payment layer, and a data governance layer
2. One Future Alliance                        :   Aims to provide technical assistance for DPI implementation in developing countries
3. Unified Payments Interface (UPI)           :   Developed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India Stack is a foundational DPI initiative that integrates several layers, including identity (Aadhaar), payments (UPI), and data governance (DigiLocker), creating a robust digital ecosystem. The One Future Alliance, a G20 initiative, aims to support the development and deployment of DPI in low- and middle-income countries, promoting capacity building and knowledge sharing.  However, the UPI, while a key component of India Stack, was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the RBI, although the RBI plays a significant regulatory role in the payments system. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair related to the One Future Alliance. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair concerning UPI's developer. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair concerning UPI's developer.


**4. Considering the regulatory framework for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulatory Framework/Concept              Specific Feature/Aspect
1. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework :   Aims to address the financial health of UCBs
2. National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) :   Acts as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs
3. Banking Regulation Act, 1949              :   Governs the licensing and operations of UCBs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework is designed to address the financial health of UCBs by implementing measures to improve their capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.  The NUCFDC serves as an umbrella organization and Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs, providing support and guidance on regulatory compliance. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, is the primary legislation governing the operations and regulations of UCBs in India, covering aspects like licensing, supervision, and other regulatory matters.  All three pairs accurately reflect aspects of the regulatory framework for UCBs in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the Logistics sector in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Policy                            Specific Feature/Aspect
1. National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022      : Includes a Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP)
2. Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs)       : Planned investment outlay of $6.2 billion
3. Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index : Measures the efficiency of logistics across Indian states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 is a comprehensive policy framework aimed at improving the efficiency and competitiveness of India's logistics sector.  A key component of the NLP is the Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP), which outlines specific actions and targets for logistics improvement. The government has planned a significant investment in the development of Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) with a projected outlay of $6.2 billion, aiming to enhance logistics infrastructure. The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index is a benchmarking tool used to evaluate and compare the performance of logistics across different states in India, promoting competition and improvement.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Entity
1. Geographical Indications Act, 1999            :   Guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge
2.  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan          :   Utilizes ArcGIS software for development
3.  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)           :   Targets ₹10 lakh crore over four years
4.  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN)                     :   Replaced the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **Geographical Indications Act, 1999:** This act guarantees *collective*, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions.  The statement incorrectly specifies individual rights.

2. **PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:** While the plan leverages GIS technology,  it specifically uses a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, not ArcGIS. The question uses a closely related but incorrect GIS software.

3. **National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP):** The NMP's target is ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹10 lakh crore, over four years (FY22 to FY25).  The question uses a significantly higher, incorrect figure.

4. **Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN):** DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), not the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Fund.  The question substitutes a related but incorrect entity.  The TRAI is a regulatory body, not a funding mechanism.


**2. With reference to the WTO Agreements, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement                                       Key Provision/Characteristic
1. Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies             :   Immediately banned all forms of fisheries subsidies
2. Agreement on Agriculture                       :   Eliminated all export subsidies for developed countries only
3. TRIPS Agreement                               :   Includes provisions from WIPO's Madrid Convention
4. Marrakesh Agreement                            :   Established the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

1. **Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies:** This agreement aimed to curb *harmful* fisheries subsidies, not ban all forms.  It allows for certain types of subsidies under specific conditions.  The statement presents an oversimplified and incorrect characterization.

2. **Agreement on Agriculture:** The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 led to the elimination of export subsidies for both developed and developing countries, not just developed countries. The statement is incomplete and inaccurate.

3. **TRIPS Agreement:** This agreement indeed incorporates provisions from the Paris and Berne Conventions of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), as stated correctly.

4. **Marrakesh Agreement:**  This agreement, signed in 1994, did indeed establish the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, replacing GATT. The year mentioned in the question is incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Economic Indicator/Initiative                      Description/Feature
1. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF)         :   Remained consistently above 20% of GDP since 1980s
2.  Project Nexus                                  :   Connects IPS of only ASEAN countries
3.  Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF)          :   Primarily focuses on industrial development in LDCs
4.  Unified Payments Interface (UPI)              :   Developed by the Reserve Bank of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched: Pair 4 (UPI).

1. **GFCF:** The statement is incorrect; GFCF fluctuated significantly, rising to around 27% in 2007-08 but dropping considerably afterward.  The statement presents a false consistency.

2. **Project Nexus:**  Project Nexus connects the Instant Payment Systems (IPS) of several countries, including India and four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand). The statement incorrectly limits its scope.

3. **EIF:** The EIF focuses on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to use *trade* as an engine for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction, not industrial development specifically. The statement misrepresents the EIF's primary focus.

4. **UPI:** The statement correctly identifies the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) as the developer of UPI.


**4. With reference to India's Economic Policies, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                                 Key Aspect/Objective
1.  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge:   Primarily aims to prevent biopiracy of Indian genetic resources.
2.  One Future Alliance                            :   Exclusively focuses on the implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in African nations.
3.  Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL)   :   A repository for protecting Indian traditional knowledge from unauthorized use.
4.  Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee :  Evaluates only state-level PPP projects.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge aims to enhance the efficacy, transparency, and quality of the patent system and prevent erroneous patents, but its scope is broader than just preventing biopiracy of Indian genetic resources.  The statement is too narrow.

2. The One Future Alliance aims to build capacity and provide technical assistance and funding support for DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries, not exclusively African nations.  The statement is overly restrictive.

3. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) accurately serves as a digital repository to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents by providing a database of traditional knowledge.

4. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central* sector PPP projects, not only state-level projects. The statement incorrectly limits its jurisdiction.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                    Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)      :   Promoting ornamental fish species
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) :   Development of Integrated Aquaparks
3. Rangeen Machhli app                               :   Strengthening the fish value chain
4. National Fisheries Development Program Portal       :   Providing multilingual information on popular fish species

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is a comprehensive scheme aiming to address various gaps in the fisheries sector, including production, productivity, technology, post-harvest infrastructure, and value chain strengthening.  The Rangeen Machhli app focuses on providing information on ornamental fish species, not the entire fish value chain.  The FIDF, as its name suggests, centers on developing infrastructure for both marine and inland fisheries. This includes initiatives like Integrated Aquaparks. The National Fisheries Development Program Portal is a platform created to support the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana, a sub-scheme under PMMSY, and thus doesn't directly relate to providing multilingual information on fish species. Option (d) correctly identifies the two pairs (2 and 4) with accurate matches.  Option (a) is incorrect because PMMSY's focus is broader than just ornamental fish. Option (b) is incorrect as the Rangeen Machhli app's function is mismatched. Option (c) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched in this option.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agricultural Initiative/Technology                 Description
1. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) :   Data exchange platform for farmer services
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)                 :   Improved yield estimation using space technology
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) :   Tech-driven solution for informed decision-making in agriculture

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

KISAN utilizes space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation, not as a data exchange platform. ADeX is indeed India's first data exchange platform for farmer services.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) leverages technology like AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the specific functions of each initiative is crucial to accurately matching them with their descriptions. The question tests both factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Crop                                            Category
1. Toria                                             :   Kharif Crop
2. Safflower                                         :   Rabi Crop
3. De-husked Coconut                               :   Commercial Crop

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Toria is a rabi crop, not a kharif crop. Safflower is correctly categorized as a rabi crop.  The MSP for de-husked coconut is fixed based on the MSP of copra, making it a commercial crop.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include the mismatched pair for Toria. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of agricultural classifications and MSP policy.  The inclusion of Toria as a distractor tests the depth of knowledge required for accurate classification beyond common crops.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Poverty Measure/Index                          Characteristic
1. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)    :   Introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog
2. India’s National MPI (NMPI)                    :   Measures poverty across 112 countries
3. Human Development Index (HDI)                 :   Developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global MPI is a global measure, not introduced by NITI Aayog in 2021.  The NMPI was indeed introduced by NITI Aayog in 2021, but it doesn't measure poverty across 112 countries; that's the Global MPI's domain. The HDI was indeed developed by Mahbub ul-Haq. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched pairs, testing the candidate's understanding of the different poverty indices and their origins. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding indices.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Microfinance Initiative/Policy                   Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY)             :   Regulatory body for MFIs
2. RBI's Malegam Committee                        :   Provides loans up to ₹10 lakh (earlier)
3. Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank :   Recommended framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PMMY provides loans, but the regulatory body for MFIs is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not PMMY.  The Malegam Committee's role was to recommend a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs, not to directly provide loans. SEWA Bank was indeed India's first MFI. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, testing the candidate's knowledge of microfinance initiatives and their features.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the roles of different entities in the microfinance sector.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Asset Monetization Initiative/Policy          Description
1. National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)       :   Provides up to 40% of project costs as a capital grant
2. Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)          :   Targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years
3. India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF):  Seeks to generate investment by monetising government assets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NMP seeks to generate investment by monetizing government assets, not to provide capital grants.  The VGF provides capital grants, as described, but it doesn't target a specific amount over four years; that's the NMP's goal.  The IIPDF aids in developing PPP projects. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain mismatched pairs, testing the candidate's understanding of asset monetization initiatives and their objectives. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different initiatives within the same policy domain.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Monetary Policy Tool/Rate                    Function
1. Variable Repo Rate (VRR)                    :   Absorbs excess liquidity from the system
2. Repo Rate                                    :   Rate at which banks borrow money from RBI
3. Open Market Operations (OMO)                :   Used to address liquidity deficit in the banking system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The VRR is used to inject, not absorb, liquidity. The Repo Rate is correctly defined as the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI. Open Market Operations (OMO) are indeed used to manage liquidity in the banking system, either by injecting or absorbing funds.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include the incorrectly matched pair for VRR, testing the candidate's understanding of monetary policy tools and their functions.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar tools.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Horticulture Initiative/Program              Feature
1. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) :   Instant disbursal of subsidies using e-RUPI
2. Coordinated Programme on Horticulture Assessment and Management using geoinformatics (CHAMAN) :   Holistic growth of horticulture sector
3. Cluster Development Programme – SURAKSHA     :   Better horticulture assessment using remote sensing and GIS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MIDH focuses on holistic growth, not instant subsidy disbursal; that's a feature of SURAKSHA. CHAMAN uses remote sensing and GIS for better assessment. SURAKSHA facilitates instant subsidy disbursal. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain mismatched pairs, testing the candidate's knowledge of horticulture initiatives and their specific functions.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding programs.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Description
1. Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)   :   Focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation.
2. Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) :   Provides multilingual information on ornamental fish.
3. Rangeen Machhli app                               :   Umbrella scheme for addressing gaps in fish production.
4. National Fisheries Development Program Portal      :   Created under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correctly matched. The National Fisheries Development Program Portal was indeed created under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana, a sub-scheme under PMMSY.  The other statements are incorrect. PMMSY is a broader scheme addressing various aspects of fish production and productivity, not solely focused on oil palm (statement 1). FIDF aims to create fisheries infrastructure, not provide information on ornamental fish (statement 2). The Rangeen Machhli app is the one that provides multilingual information on ornamental fish, not FIDF (statement 3).  These incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise knowledge of specific government schemes and their functions for accurate matching in UPSC-style questions.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of related but distinct initiatives within the fisheries sector.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument/Concept                      Description
1.  Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) volatility index   :   Introduced a volatility index for Indian markets in 1993.
2.  Finternet                                         :   Vision for a future financial system proposed by Bill Gates.
3.  Perpetual Bonds                                   :   Bonds with a fixed maturity date.
4.  Participatory Notes (P-Notes)                     :   Issued by unregistered foreign FPIs to invest in the Indian stock market directly.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The CBOE introduced its volatility index for US markets, not Indian markets, in 1993 (statement 1). Finternet was proposed by Nandan Nilekani, not Bill Gates (statement 2). Perpetual bonds, by definition, do *not* have a fixed maturity date; that's their key characteristic (statement 3).  P-Notes are issued by *registered* foreign FPIs to overseas investors who wish to invest indirectly in the Indian stock market without direct registration (statement 4). The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of financial instruments and their characteristics.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar concepts in finance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                               Definition/Description
1. Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio                           :   Percentage of a bank's investments relative to its total deposits.
2. Net Interest Margin (NIM)                           :   Measure of the net return on a bank's earning assets.
3. Special Drawing Facility (SDF) Overdraft Facility   :   Facility availed by states against collateral of agricultural produce.
4. Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF)                    :   Reserve fund maintained by some states with the commercial banks.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The CD ratio accurately represents the percentage of loans issued relative to total deposits (statement 1). NIM correctly measures the net return on a bank's earning assets, including loans and investments (statement 2).  Statement 3 is incorrect because the SDF overdraft facility is availed against collateral like Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF), Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF), etc., not agricultural produce. Statement 4 is incorrect as CSF is maintained with the RBI, not commercial banks.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of banking terminology and financial ratios, requiring both factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                                  Focus/Objective
1. National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) :   Aims to expand oil palm cultivation to 3.70 lakh hectares.
2. National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)           :   Focuses on seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer for oilseeds.
3. Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)      :   Ensures MSP for oilseed farmers through price support schemes.
4. Yellow Revolution                                      :   Movement to boost production of pulses and rice.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The NMEO-OP aims to significantly expand oil palm cultivation (statement 1 is incorrect regarding the target area). NFSM-OS&OP indeed focuses on seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer for oilseeds (statement 2). PM-AASHA correctly ensures MSP for oilseed farmers (statement 3).  The Yellow Revolution focused on boosting edible oil production, primarily from mustard and sesame seeds, not pulses and rice (statement 4). The incorrect pairings test the candidate's understanding of government initiatives aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in edible oils, requiring knowledge of specific programs and their objectives.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar agricultural policies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                                       Objective

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global MPI, a collaborative effort of the UNDP and OPHI, indeed focuses on measuring multiple deprivations across education, health, and living standards.  This is a core component of its methodology, aiming to capture a more holistic view of poverty than solely income-based measures.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced by NITI Aayog, builds upon the global MPI but incorporates additional indicators specific to the Indian context, notably maternal health and access to bank accounts. These additions reflect the unique challenges and priorities within the Indian development landscape. The Prosperity Gap, as defined in the World Bank's report, accurately describes the multiplicative factor needed to lift global incomes to a prosperity standard of $25 per person per day. This metric highlights the significant disparity between current income levels and the target for global prosperity.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.

While MIDH has a broad scope encompassing various horticultural products, its primary focus extends beyond root and tuber crops to include fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, and other horticultural produce.  The statement oversimplifies the scheme's wide range of objectives.

Pair 3 is incorrectly matched. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a broader initiative aimed at monetizing government assets across various sectors to generate investment.  While it might indirectly impact the agricultural sector through infrastructure development or asset sales related to agriculture, its direct focus is not solely on agricultural assets.  The question attempts to create a misleading link.


**2. With reference to India's silk production and related organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                          Characteristic/Achievement

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The passage clearly mentions the centenary celebration of ICAR-NISA.  This is a specific and verifiable piece of information.

Pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The text states that the Central Silk Board celebrated its platinum jubilee (75th anniversary), not its 50th anniversary. This is a straightforward factual error designed as a distractor.

Pair 4 is incorrectly matched. The text indicates that India is the second-largest silk producer globally, not the largest.  This is a crucial detail deliberately altered to create a challenging question.



**3. With reference to agricultural policies and initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                                   Description/Objective
1. Minimum Support Price (MSP)                       : Covers only Kharif crops
2. Public Stockholding (PSH)                         : Aims to prevent farmers from distress selling of crops at MSP
3. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX)                 : Primarily focuses on providing real-time information on weather patterns to farmers
4. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And Geoinformatics): Uses remote sensing data for yield estimation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched. The primary objective of Public Stockholding (PSH) is indeed to enable governments to procure crops at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), thereby preventing farmers from distress sales at lower prices.  This aligns perfectly with the policy's core function.

Pair 4 is correctly matched. KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics, including remote sensing data, for improved yield estimation in agriculture. This is a direct application of the technology mentioned.

Pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The MSP scheme covers a broader range of crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops, as well as certain commercial crops.  Restricting it to only Kharif crops is an inaccurate simplification.

Pair 3 is incorrectly matched. While ADeX uses geospatial data, its main purpose is not solely focused on providing real-time weather information.  It offers a more comprehensive dataset including farmer identity, farm location, and crop-sown data to facilitate various farmer services and informed decision-making. The description is too narrow.


**4.  Consider the following pairs related to India's infrastructure development:**

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The World Bank report explicitly analyzed PPP regulatory frameworks across 140 economies, as stated in the provided text. This is a direct and verifiable fact.

Pair 4 is correctly matched.  The text clearly states that BISAG-N developed the Digital Master Planning tool utilized in the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan.  This is a direct causal link.

Pair 1 is incorrectly matched. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is driven by seven engines of infrastructure development, not five.  The number is deliberately reduced to create a distractor.

Pair 2 is incorrectly matched. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs, under the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This is a deliberate shift to a related but incorrect ministry.


**5. With reference to seaweed farming and related initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                                    Focus/Activity

4. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) : Regulates Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While NaBFID was established as a DFI under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not the Companies Act, 2013 (it was *notified* under the Companies Act), the other three pairs are accurate. NUCFDC functions as an SRO for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).  RBI regulates ARCs under the SARFAESI Act.  SEBI, as the regulator of securities markets, oversees InvITs. Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly states the act under which NaBFID was established. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of SEBI and InvITs and the correct pairing of RBI and ARCs. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of NUCFDC and its function.  Therefore, only option (d) correctly identifies all the accurate pairings, demonstrating understanding of the regulatory frameworks governing various financial institutions in India.

2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs): Provide funds to PACS
3.  NABARD                                   : Refinances DCCBs and SCBs
4.  National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC): Provides loans and grants to State Governments for financing cooperative societies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the functions and characteristics of the listed organizations within the Indian cooperative sector. PACS are indeed significant contributors to Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans. DCCBs play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS. NABARD's refinancing function extends to both DCCBs and Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs).  Finally, NCDC provides financial support to state governments to strengthen cooperative societies.  The correct answer encompasses all four pairings, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of the Indian cooperative credit system.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly omit at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Indian rural credit system and the roles played by various institutions in its functioning.  It also requires the recall of specific numerical data (41%).


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Rating Agency                         Regulatory Oversight
1. Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs)               : Regulated primarily by SEBI
2.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)       : Released by the Office of the Economic Adviser
3.  Container Port Performance Index (CPPI)   : Yangshan Port (China) ranked top in 2023
4.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA): Granted Navratna status


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While CRAs are regulated by multiple agencies including SEBI, RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA, SEBI is the primary regulator. The ICI is indeed released by the Office of the Economic Adviser. IREDA was granted Navratna status.  However, the CPPI ranking is a statement of fact, not a regulatory pairing.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly paired item (CPPI).  Option (c) accurately identifies the three correctly matched pairs, showcasing knowledge of the regulatory environment of various entities and the sources of key economic indicators.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern relevant information from descriptive statements.
