The production of these different varieties contributes to the economic diversification of the silk industry.


**5. With reference to India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a major contributor to economic losses in the livestock sector.
2. India ranks first globally in the consumption of antibiotics in animals.
3. The average annual productivity of cattle in India significantly exceeds the world average.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FMD and other animal diseases cause substantial economic losses in India's livestock sector, impacting milk production, meat production, and overall agricultural productivity.  Effective disease control measures are crucial for improving the sector's economic performance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India ranks fourth globally in the use of antibiotics in animals, not first.  The overuse of antibiotics raises concerns about antimicrobial resistance, impacting both animal and human health.  Sustainable livestock management practices are needed to reduce the reliance on antibiotics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The average annual productivity of cattle in India (1777 kg/animal/year) is significantly lower than the world average (2699 kg/animal/year). This gap highlights the need for improvements in livestock breeding, management, and nutrition to enhance productivity.


**6. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF primarily focuses on short-term debt financing for agricultural projects.
2. The AIF provides interest subvention and credit guarantee support for loans up to ₹2 crore.
3. The AIF is entirely funded through government budgetary allocations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF is designed as a medium-to-long-term debt financing facility, not solely for short-term needs.  The longer-term financing enables investments in sustainable infrastructure with lasting benefits.  Short-term funding would not be sufficient for many of the projects supported by the AIF.

Statement 2 is correct. The AIF provides crucial support to borrowers through interest subvention (3% per annum) and credit guarantee coverage under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) for loans up to ₹2 crore. This makes borrowing more accessible and affordable for farmers and related businesses.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the government provides the interest subvention and credit guarantee support, the loans themselves are provided by banks and financial institutions.  The ₹1 lakh crore is not directly from the government budget but facilitated through the banking and financial system.


**7. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's agricultural exports consistently exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion by 2022.
2. Agricultural exports and imports both registered an increase in 2023-24.
3. The 2018 Agricultural Export Policy aimed to significantly boost the country's agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set for 2022 by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy.  This indicates challenges in achieving the ambitious goals set for agricultural exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Both agricultural exports and imports registered a decline in 2023-24, not an increase.  This signifies a slowdown in trade related to agricultural products, potentially influenced by various factors like global economic conditions and domestic production levels.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2018 Agricultural Export Policy was indeed designed to significantly enhance India's agricultural exports.  It aimed to increase the volume and value of agricultural exports by improving infrastructure, promoting value addition, and accessing new international markets.


**8. With reference to the initiatives to promote millet cultivation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Food Security Mission primarily focuses on reducing the production of millets.
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 programs mandate the daily supply of millets.
3.  A Production Linked Incentive Scheme specifically targets millet-based products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Food Security Mission aims to increase the production and productivity of millets, not reduce it.  The mission supports various initiatives to enhance millet cultivation, including improved seeds, farming practices, and post-harvest management.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 programs mandate the supply of millets at least once a week, not daily.  This reflects the government's effort to promote millets as a nutritious food source, particularly for vulnerable populations.

Statement 3 is correct.  A Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industry for Millet-based products (PLISMBP) exists to support the value addition and processing of millets, boosting the economic viability of millet cultivation.  This initiative encourages investment in processing infrastructure and creating market opportunities.


**9. With reference to the jute industry in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India accounts for approximately 50% of the estimated world jute production.
2. The process of loosening jute fiber from the woody core is known as "retting."
3. The National Jute Board was established under the National Jute Board Act, 2008.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is the leading jute goods producing country, accounting for about 70% of the estimated world production, not approximately 50%.  This significant share underlines India's dominance in the global jute market.

Statement 2 is correct. "Retting" is the crucial microbial process used to loosen the jute fiber from the woody core, preparing it for further processing.  This traditional method is an essential step in jute production.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Jute Board (NJB) was indeed constituted under the National Jute Board Act, 2008.  It plays a vital role in promoting the development and growth of the jute industry in India, covering cultivation, manufacturing, and marketing aspects.


**10. With reference to the SPICED scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The SPICED scheme primarily focuses on the production of spices other than cardamom.
2. The SPICED scheme's implementation period is aligned with the 15th Finance Commission's tenure (2023-24 to 2025-26).
3. The SPICED scheme aims to enhance the export competitiveness of Indian spices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SPICED scheme encompasses various aspects of spice production, a major focus is on cardamom (both small and large cardamom) cultivation and productivity improvements. This highlights the importance of cardamom in the Indian spice export market.

Statement 2 is correct. The implementation of the SPICED scheme is indeed timed to coincide with the 15th Finance Commission's tenure (2023-24 to 2025-26). This ensures that the scheme's activities are aligned with the commission's overall developmental priorities and resource allocation.

Statement 3 is correct.  The SPICED scheme aims to enhance the export competitiveness of Indian spices through various interventions, including improving productivity, quality upgradation, market expansion, and capacity building.  Improving the competitiveness of Indian spices in the global market is a key objective.



**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All UCBs are allowed to open new branches without prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), up to a certain percentage of their existing branches.
2.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is a type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND) registered with the RBI.
3. The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, will replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and apply to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some UCBs are allowed to open new branches up to 10% (maximum 5 branches) of their existing number without prior RBI approval, this is not applicable to all UCBs.  The permission depends on various factors and isn't a universal rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, unlike Type I. This distinction is crucial in understanding its regulatory role and operational scope.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI's new PCA framework for UCBs is indeed effective from April 1, 2025, replacing the SAF and applying to most UCBs, excluding those under AID. This reflects a shift towards a more precise and flexible approach to addressing the financial health of UCBs.  The key monitoring areas for PCA are capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is a market-determined rate always lower than the Repo Rate and is used to inject short-term liquidity.
2.  To increase market liquidity and stimulate economic growth, the RBI buys government securities (G-secs) under Open Market Operations (OMO) and reduces the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, and Bank Rate.
3.  The Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) is used to absorb excess liquidity from the system, and its rate is always higher than the Reverse Repo Rate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the VRR is a market-determined rate used to inject short-term liquidity, it is generally lower than the Repo Rate, but it cannot go below the Reverse Repo Rate. This crucial detail distinguishes it from a completely free-floating market rate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The actions described – buying G-secs under OMO and reducing CRR, SLR, Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, and Bank Rate – are indeed standard RBI tools used to increase market liquidity and boost economic activity. Lowering these rates makes borrowing cheaper for banks and businesses, encouraging investment and spending.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The VRRR absorbs excess liquidity, but there's no guarantee its rate will always be higher than the Reverse Repo Rate.  Market dynamics influence the VRRR rate, and it could potentially fall below the Reverse Repo Rate in specific circumstances.


**3. With reference to the regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs (except Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above, and those authorized to accept deposits or having customer interfaces, are covered under the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS).
2.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) covers all deposits in NBFCs up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.
3.  The Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs categorizes them into four layers based solely on their asset size, with each tier facing identical regulatory requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RB-IOS indeed covers the specified category of NBFCs. This reflects the RBI's efforts to provide a robust grievance redressal mechanism for customers interacting with these financial institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DICGC insurance does *not* cover NBFC deposits. DICGC coverage is limited to commercial banks, regional rural banks, and certain other specified institutions.  This is a significant difference between banks and NBFCs, highlighting the higher risk associated with NBFC investments.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While SBR does categorize NBFCs into four layers, the categorization is not based solely on asset size.  It considers factors like activity, perceived riskiness, and other relevant parameters.  The regulatory requirements also differ across tiers, tailored to their risk profiles.


**4. With reference to the Indian agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all 22 crops is recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and finalized by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Finance Minister.
2.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform primarily holds data on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown.
3.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, aimed for agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2022, and this target was successfully met.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP does recommend MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Finance Minister.  This reflects the high-level policy importance of MSP decisions.

Statement 2 is correct. ADeX does indeed hold the three specified datasets. This illustrates the government's commitment to leveraging technology for improved agricultural data management and service delivery.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 was *not* met; there was a significant shortfall.  This highlights the challenges in achieving ambitious export targets in the agricultural sector.


**5.  With reference to the regulatory oversight of Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seven CRAs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), including Brickwork Ratings.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) accredits all CRAs as External Credit Assessment Institutions for rating bank loans and facilities.
3.  SEBI regulations require CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seven CRAs are registered with SEBI, Brickwork Ratings is *not* included among the six others that are RBI-accredited. This subtle distinction is important in understanding the regulatory landscape of CRAs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI accredits CRAs as External Credit Assessment Institutions but not *all* CRAs.  There's a differentiation among registered and accredited agencies, highlighting the nuances of regulatory oversight.

Statement 3 is correct.  SEBI regulations mandate the disclosure of the information mentioned, promoting transparency and accountability in credit rating practices.  This is a key aspect of protecting investors and maintaining market integrity.


**6. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds, allowing investors to invest in infrastructure projects and are recognized as borrowers under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).
2. The new SEBI norms allow for the issuance of subordinate units by all InvITs to sponsors on acquisition of an infrastructure project.
3. InvITs earn income primarily through tolls, rents, interest, or dividends from their investments, which are distributed to investors as non-taxable earnings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. InvITs function as described, providing a mechanism for investing in infrastructure projects and are recognized under SARFAESI Act.  This highlights the legal framework supporting InvITs and their role in infrastructure financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The new SEBI norms allow the issuance of subordinate units by *privately placed* InvITs to sponsors, not *all* InvITs. This limitation reflects a targeted approach to address specific valuation challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The income earned by InvITs is distributed to investors as *taxable*, not non-taxable, earnings. This is a crucial aspect for potential investors to consider, as it impacts their overall returns.


**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s surplus and its transfer to the government, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of the RBI's entire net interest income to the central government.
2. The Malegam Committee's (2013) recommendations led to a significant decrease in the surplus transferred from the RBI to the government.
3.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as determined by the Bimal Jalan Committee, dictates that surplus transfer depends on maintaining realized equity between 5.5% and 6.5% of the balance sheet, with any excess transferred to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Act, 1934, Section 47 mandates the transfer of RBI's *profits* to the Centre, not its entire net interest income.  A crucial distinction exists between profits (income minus expenditure) and net interest income (the difference between interest earned and interest paid).  The text clearly states that RBI's total expenditure is only about 1/7th of its total net interest income, implying a significant difference between the two.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Malegam Committee (2013) recommendations actually led to an *increase*, not a decrease, in surplus transfers to the government. This is a direct contradiction of the statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bimal Jalan Committee's Economic Capital Framework (ECF) indeed specifies that surplus transfer is contingent on maintaining realized equity within a specific range (5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet).  Excess above this threshold is transferred to the government. The statement accurately reflects this key aspect of the ECF.  The inclusion of the Currency & Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA) further adds to the complexity of the framework, making the statement factually accurate.


**2. With reference to Ways and Means Advances (WMA) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ways and Means Advances are short-term loans provided by the RBI to state governments only, to bridge temporary gaps in their revenue and expenditure.
2. Special WMA (now known as Special Drawing Facility, or SDF) carries a higher interest rate than Normal WMA.
3.  The interest rates on both Normal and Special WMAs are linked to the repo rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While WMAs are indeed short-term advances to bridge temporary cash flow mismatches, they are available to *both* state/UT governments and the Union Government.  The statement incorrectly limits the beneficiaries to state governments only.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that Special WMA (SDF) has a *lower* interest rate than Normal WMA. This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that interest rates on both types of WMAs are linked to the repo rate. This makes the statement factually accurate.  This is a key characteristic of the WMA scheme's design.


**3. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years (FY22 to FY26) by monetizing existing government assets.
2. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant to enhance project viability.
3. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended Asset Monetization in 2012.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's target is ₹6.0 lakh crore over *four* years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  This seemingly minor detail is crucial for factual accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The VGF provides up to *40%*, not 50%, of project costs as a capital grant.  This difference is significant and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the scheme's parameters.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended Asset Monetization in 2012.  This is a well-established fact in the context of Indian economic policy.


**4. With reference to the functioning of Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  One of the most important functions of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) is to provide funds to PACS.
3. PACS account for over 50% of the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans disbursed in 2022.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS), not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  They are *not* regulated by the RBI.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that one of the primary functions of DCCBs is to provide funds to PACS. This is a key aspect of the cooperative credit structure in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PACS accounted for 41% of KCC loans in 2022,  not over 50%. This is a significant numerical discrepancy that renders the statement false.


**5.  With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI introduced PSL in 1982 to ensure credit flow to vulnerable sections of society.
2.  The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework for districts with higher credit flow from FY25.
3.  All bank loans to MSMEs qualify for classification under PSL.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PSL was formalized in 1972, not 1982.  The committees mentioned (Gadgil and Ghosh) predate 1982, further supporting this correction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework for districts with *lower*, not higher, credit flow.  The aim is to improve credit access in underserved areas.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that all bank loans to MSMEs qualify for PSL classification. This is a key policy decision to support the MSME sector.


**6. With reference to the  Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI recently proposed replacing MIBOR with an unsecured money market benchmark.
2. MIBOR is a key benchmark rate used for pricing various financial instruments in the Indian money market.
3. MIBOR's calculation methodology has remained unchanged since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI recommended changes in MIBOR's calculation methodology and proposed transitioning to a new *secured*, not unsecured, money market benchmark for popular product derivatives.  The nature of the proposed replacement is crucial.

Statement 2 is correct. MIBOR is indeed a key benchmark rate used for pricing various financial instruments in the Indian money market.  Its role in the financial system is well-established.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The news indicates that the RBI recommended changes to MIBOR's calculation methodology, implying that it has not remained unchanged.  The very fact that changes are being proposed negates the statement.



**7. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and the Financial Stability Report (FSR) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FSR is based on assessments conducted by the  Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. Scheduled commercial banks' Gross NPAs (GNPAs) and Net NPA ratios reached multi-year highs in March 2024.
3. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, aims to resolve stressed assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FSR is based on assessments of the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), not solely the RBI.  The FSDC is a broader body involving multiple financial sector regulators.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report highlights that Scheduled commercial banks' Gross NPAs (GNPAs) and Net NPA ratios fell to multi-year *lows*, not highs, in March-end 2024. This is a direct contradiction of the statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The IBC, 2016, is designed to address stressed assets through reorganization and insolvency resolution. This is a key function of the IBC.


**8. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All UCBs are allowed to open new branches without prior approval from the RBI.
2. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the UCB sector.
3. The RBI brought management, governance, and winding up of UCBs under its purview before the establishment of NUCFDC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Only *some* UCBs are allowed to open new branches up to a certain limit without prior RBI approval. The statement presents an overly broad generalization.

Statement 2 is correct. The NUCFDC is indeed registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND and operates as an SRO for the UCB sector.  This is a key function of the NUCFDC.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage mentions that the RBI brought management, governance, winding up, etc., under its purview. The establishment of NUCFDC is a later development aiming to further regulate and support the UCB sector.  The timeline is important here.


**9. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework will replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) from April 1, 2024.
2. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
3. Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are key monitoring areas under the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework will be effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  The implementation date is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PCA framework *excludes* UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). The statement incorrectly includes them within the framework's scope.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly states that Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are the key areas for monitoring under the new PCA framework.  This aligns with typical banking regulatory practices.




**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND) registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, applies to all UCBs irrespective of their tier classification and includes those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
3.  UCBs are allowed to open new branches up to a maximum of 5 branches in a financial year without prior RBI approval, regardless of their existing branch network size.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which accurately describes NUCFDC's role.  Type I NBFC-NDs do not have such direct interaction with the public.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework explicitly excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The framework aims for precision and flexibility, and applying it universally would contradict this objective.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While some UCBs are allowed to expand their branch network without prior RBI approval, the limit is tied to a percentage (up to 10%) of their existing branches, not a fixed number of 5 branches.  The condition is also applicable only for the previous financial year.


**2. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revised PSL norms for FY25 introduce a uniform weighting of 100% for all districts, irrespective of their credit flow.
2.  All bank loans to MSMEs, regardless of the district's credit flow, qualify for PSL classification.
3.  PSL certificates (PSLCs) are non-tradable instruments used to ensure banks meet their PSL targets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised PSL norms introduce a differentiated weighting system based on the credit flow in different districts. Districts with lower credit flow receive higher weighting (125%), while those with high credit flow receive lower weighting (90%).  A uniform 100% weighting is not applied universally.

Statement 2 is correct.  The revised norms explicitly state that all bank loans to MSMEs qualify for PSL classification. This is a significant feature designed to boost lending to this crucial sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PSLCs are, in fact, tradable certificates. This tradability allows banks with surplus PSL lending to sell their certificates to banks that need to meet their targets, creating a more efficient mechanism for achieving PSL objectives.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) is published biannually, providing a snapshot of financial inclusion across India.
2. The Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), regardless of their asset size or whether they accept deposits.
3. Project Nexus, an initiative to enable instant cross-border retail payments, is solely driven by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published annually, not biannually.  Its annual publication allows for a comprehensive assessment of changes in financial inclusion over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RB-IOS has specific coverage criteria.  While it does cover many NBFCs, it excludes Housing Finance Companies and those with assets below a certain threshold (₹100 crore). The statement oversimplifies the scheme's scope.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative, conceptualized by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and involving several countries, including India.  The RBI's participation is crucial, but it is not the sole driver of the project.


**4. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to monetize only brownfield assets, excluding greenfield projects.
2. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 60% of project costs as a capital grant to enhance project viability.
3.  The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended asset monetization in 2015.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NMP focuses on monetizing existing (brownfield) government assets, leveraging their existing infrastructure and operational capacity to generate revenue.  Greenfield projects, being new ventures, are not the primary focus of this initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 60%, as a capital grant to improve project viability and attract private investment.  The 40% limit is a crucial aspect of the scheme's design.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation for asset monetization was made in 2012, not 2015.  This earlier recommendation laid the groundwork for later initiatives like the NMP.


**5.  With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure fair prices for farmers.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any government oversight.
3. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And Geoinformatics) is a technology-driven initiative aimed at improving crop yield estimation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MSP is announced at the beginning of the sowing season, not at the end of the harvesting season. This timing is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions about their planting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends the MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister.  The government's role in finalizing the MSP is essential for policy coherence.

Statement 3 is correct. KISAN is a technology-driven initiative using space technology and geoinformatics to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of crop yield estimation.  This contributes to better planning and resource allocation in the agricultural sector.




**1. With reference to Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council, a constitutional body established under Article 279A, is responsible for setting GST tax rates and making policy decisions.
2.  Excise duty on petroleum products remains outside the purview of GST, continuing to be levied separately by the central government.
3.  The 101st Constitutional Amendment Act introduced GST in 2017, subsuming several indirect taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the GST regime in India.  The GST Council, as per Article 279A, is indeed responsible for setting tax rates and formulating GST policies.  A crucial point often overlooked is that excise duty on petroleum products was specifically *excluded* from the GST ambit at its inception and continues to be levied separately. This is a key characteristic of the GST's implementation in India. Finally, the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act is correctly identified as the legislative basis for introducing the GST in 2017, replacing a multitude of pre-existing indirect taxes.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct statement, misrepresenting the comprehensive nature of the GST's impact and the specific exclusions made during its implementation.  Understanding the exceptions to the GST's coverage is vital for a thorough understanding of India's indirect tax system.


**2. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS occurs when the GST rate on inputs exceeds the GST rate on the finished goods, leading to blocked Input Tax Credit (ITC).
2.  The Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays a significant role in identifying and recommending solutions to the government for addressing IDS issues.
3.  IDS primarily impacts the export competitiveness of domestic industries by making products more expensive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate descriptions of the inverted duty structure. The core of IDS lies in the higher tax burden on inputs compared to the final product, resulting in ITC blockage.  The Ministry of Commerce and Industry actively engages in identifying sectors facing IDS challenges and suggests remedial measures to the Ministry of Finance. This inter-ministerial coordination is crucial for policy responses. Finally, the impact on export competitiveness is a direct consequence of higher input costs making domestic products less price-competitive in global markets. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of IDS and the roles of different government bodies in addressing this economic issue. A comprehensive understanding of IDS requires knowledge of its mechanics, its impact, and the governmental mechanisms designed to mitigate its negative consequences.


**3. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Bill, 2024, introduced a complete abolishment of indexation benefits for LTCG on immovable properties acquired after a specific cut-off date.
2.  A grandfather clause in the amendment protects properties acquired before the cut-off date, allowing them to continue benefiting from indexation.
3.  The amendment significantly impacts the tax liabilities of individuals selling immovable properties acquired after the specified date.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The three statements accurately reflect the key features of the LTCG tax amendment. The amendment did indeed remove indexation benefits for LTCG on immovable properties acquired after a specific date.  Crucially, the legislation included a grandfather clause, preserving indexation benefits for properties acquired *before* that date. This is a standard practice in tax law to avoid retroactive application of changes. Finally, the removal of indexation will undoubtedly increase the tax burden for those selling properties acquired after the cut-off date, a significant change in tax policy. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, missing at least one critical aspect of the amendment. Understanding the interplay between indexation, grandfathering, and the overall impact on tax liabilities is essential for comprehending the implications of this significant legislative change.


**4. With reference to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CBIC is responsible for the administration of direct tax laws in India.
2.  The CBIC operates under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
3.  The CBIC's functions encompass the administration of indirect tax laws through the Income Tax Department.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The CBIC falls under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBIC administers *indirect* taxes, not direct taxes. The Income Tax Department handles direct taxes. Statement 3 is also incorrect because, while the CBIC administers indirect taxes, it does so *through* various departments and not specifically the Income Tax Department. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one false statement. This question highlights the importance of precisely understanding the functions and organizational structure of government bodies involved in tax administration.  The distinction between direct and indirect taxes is crucial, and the CBIC's role is specifically in the realm of indirect taxation.


**5. With reference to the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Mauritius, consider the following statements:**

1.  The DTAA aims to prevent double taxation of the same income in both countries.
2.  A recent protocol amended the DTAA to incorporate the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to curb tax evasion.
3.  The DTAA primarily benefits Indian investors by reducing their tax burden in Mauritius.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The fundamental purpose of a DTAA is to avoid double taxation on the same income source.  The amendment incorporating the PPT is also accurate; it was designed to prevent treaty abuse for tax evasion. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the DTAA benefits both countries by promoting investment, it primarily aims for equitable tax allocation between the source and residence countries, not solely benefiting Indian investors.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either misrepresent the core function of a DTAA or incorrectly assign its benefits.  Understanding DTAs requires a grasp of their core purpose—preventing double taxation—and the mechanisms employed to prevent treaty shopping and tax avoidance.  The PPT is a significant element in modern DTAs to address these challenges.


**6. With reference to the  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The BIS is responsible for issuing the ISI mark, a mandatory quality control certification for several products in India.
2.  The BIS operates under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
3.  The BIS also administers the Hallmark certification for precious metals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The BIS is the body responsible for administering the ISI mark, a crucial quality control measure for various products sold in India.  The BIS also administers the Hallmark certification for precious metals, ensuring purity and fineness. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the BIS's activities are related to the commerce and industry sector, its administrative oversight may not necessarily fall directly under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  The other options are therefore incorrect because they contain at least one false statement. This question tests understanding of the BIS's role in quality control and standardization within the Indian economy.  The ISI mark and Hallmark are two important functions that are frequently tested in examinations.


**7. With reference to  Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and provisioning norms for cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently revised NPA provisioning norms for all types of cooperative banks, including urban, state, and central cooperative banks.
2.  Under the revised norms, provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account.
3.  Cooperative banks are not allowed to allocate net profits to BDDR after complying with the Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The RBI has indeed revised NPA provisioning norms for all categories of cooperative banks.  The revised norms mandate that provisions for BDDR be treated as an expense in the Profit & Loss Account. Statement 3 is incorrect; cooperative banks *are* allowed to allocate net profits to BDDR after meeting IRACP requirements and other regulations.  This allocation is a crucial part of risk management. The other options are incorrect as they contain at least one false statement. This question assesses comprehension of banking regulations and the management of NPAs within the cooperative banking sector.  The detailed knowledge of provisioning norms and their impact on bank profitability is crucial for understanding financial stability.


**8. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PCA framework aims to improve the financial health of UCBs with greater precision and flexibility.
2.  The PCA framework replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) for UCBs.
3.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, irrespective of their tier or inclusion under All Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The PCA framework is designed to address the financial health of UCBs more effectively and with greater adaptability.  It is indeed a replacement for the existing SAF. Statement 3 is incorrect; the PCA framework does have exceptions, excluding certain UCBs based on their tier categorization or inclusion under AID. The other options are incorrect because they include the false statement.  This question delves into the specifics of regulatory frameworks for cooperative banks, testing knowledge of the PCA framework and its nuances.  Understanding the application and purpose of such frameworks is essential for analyzing the stability of the cooperative banking sector.


**9. With reference to Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs) as per the RBI framework, consider the following statements:**

1.  SROs must be set up as for-profit companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  An SRO's board of directors must include at least one-third independent members, including the chairperson.
3.  SROs are primarily responsible for enforcing regulatory compliance within their respective sectors, leaving enforcement to the RBI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The RBI framework mandates that at least one-third of an SRO's board of directors, including the chairperson, must be independent. Statement 1 is incorrect; SROs are required to be *not-for-profit* companies under Section 8.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while SROs promote compliance, they do not solely enforce it; the RBI retains its regulatory oversight and enforcement powers.  The other options are incorrect as they contain false statements. This question tests an understanding of the RBI's approach to self-regulation, focusing on the structural aspects and responsibilities of SROs.  The balance between self-regulation and central bank oversight is a key element of this framework.


**10. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IBC brought management, governance, and winding-up procedures for all entities under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  Insolvency refers to a financial situation where an entity's liabilities exceed its assets or it cannot pay its debts when due.
3.  The IBC aims to streamline and expedite the resolution of insolvency cases, ensuring a timely and efficient process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The definition of insolvency accurately describes the financial distress situation covered by the IBC.  The IBC's core purpose is to create a more efficient and faster process for resolving insolvency cases.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the IBC significantly impacts financial entities, it doesn't place *all* aspects of management, governance, and winding-up under the RBI's direct control.  Other regulatory bodies and processes remain involved. The other options are therefore incorrect. This question focuses on the IBC's core definition, objectives, and scope, testing a thorough understanding of its functions and limitations.  The IBC's impact on corporate restructuring and debt resolution is a significant area of study.



**1. With reference to the administration of direct tax laws in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Income Tax Department is responsible for the administration of direct tax laws and operates under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.
2.  The Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) between India and Mauritius, first signed in 1982, has never been amended.
3. The Principal Purpose Test (PPT), introduced as an amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA, aims to prevent the abuse of tax treaties for tax evasion and avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Income Tax Department, under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, is indeed responsible for administering direct tax laws in India.  This is a fundamental aspect of India's tax system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DTAA between India and Mauritius, initially signed in 1982, has been amended, notably in 2016 and further amended by a protocol (though not yet ratified).  This reflects the evolving nature of international tax agreements and the need to adapt to changing global economic realities and to curb tax avoidance practices.

Statement 3 is correct. The Principal Purpose Test (PPT) is a key feature of the amendments to several DTAAs, including the one with Mauritius.  The PPT is designed to prevent treaty shopping, where MNEs exploit differences in tax laws to artificially reduce their overall tax liability.  Its inclusion demonstrates India's commitment to aligning its tax treaties with international standards to prevent base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).  The PPT focuses on the main objective of a transaction, ensuring that tax benefits are not granted if the primary purpose is tax avoidance.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions concerning cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI has introduced revised Non-Performing Asset (NPA) provision norms for cooperative banks, mandating that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) under Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account before allocating net profits to BDDR.
2. The RBI has formed a committee to address co-lending issues, involving partnerships between banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to provide loans, where banks are allowed to co-lend with NBFCs belonging to the promoter group.
3. The RBI's direction on the treatment of wilful defaulters (WDs) and large defaulters applies only to outstanding amounts below ₹25 lakh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI has indeed revised NPA provision norms for cooperative banks. A key aspect of these revisions is the requirement to charge provisions for BDDR as an expense before allocating profits, reflecting a stricter approach to risk management and capital adequacy within the cooperative banking sector.  This ensures a more realistic assessment of a bank's financial health.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI has indeed addressed co-lending issues and formed committees, a crucial detail is omitted: banks are *not* allowed to co-lend with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.  This restriction is designed to mitigate conflicts of interest and prevent potential misuse of co-lending arrangements.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI's direction on wilful defaulters (WDs) and large defaulters applies to outstanding amounts of ₹25 lakh and *above*, not below.  This threshold indicates the significance of the amounts involved and the seriousness with which the RBI treats such defaults.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI was established in 2009 under the Competition Act of 2003.
2. The CCI's composition includes a Chairperson and 7 Members appointed by the Central Government.
3.  The CCI's functions include preventing anti-competitive practices, promoting competition, protecting consumers' interests, and ensuring freedom of trade.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CCI was established in 2009, the enabling legislation is the Competition Act, 2002, not 2003.  This is a crucial detail reflecting the legislative framework governing the CCI's operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CCI comprises a Chairperson and 6 Members, not 7, appointed by the Central Government.  This reflects the structure and composition of this important regulatory body.

Statement 3 is correct. The CCI's functions accurately reflect its mandate to ensure a competitive market environment, protecting consumers and promoting fair trade practices.  These functions are central to the CCI's role in the Indian economy.

Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct.  The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding the year of the Competition Act and the number of CCI members.


**4. With reference to the Indian coal sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's high import dependence on coking coal is primarily due to the abundance of high gross calorific value (GCV) coal within the country.
2. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, prohibited the auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities.
3. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, introduced the Composite Prospecting Licence-cum-Mining Lease (PL-cum-ML) for coal, aiming to enhance transparency and efficiency in mining license allocation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's high import dependence on coking coal stems from the *lack* of sufficient high-GCV coal domestically.  Indian coking coal often has a higher ash content compared to imported coal, affecting its quality and suitability for certain industries like iron and steel.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, actually *permitted* the auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities, marking a significant shift in the sector's structure.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, did indeed introduce the Composite PL-cum-ML for coal, streamlining the licensing process and aiming to improve transparency and efficiency.

Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The other statements misrepresent key aspects of India's coal sector dynamics and policy changes.


**5. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, launched in 2022, integrates data from various ministries.
2. The Digital Master Planning tool used in PM GatiShakti is developed by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG-N) and uses a GIS platform.
3.  PM GatiShakti's approach is driven by six engines focusing on infrastructure development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan was launched in 2021, not 2022. This is a significant detail regarding the timeline of this important infrastructure initiative.

Statement 2 is correct.  BISAG-N, using a GIS platform, did indeed develop the Digital Master Planning tool for PM GatiShakti. This is a crucial component of the plan's implementation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PM GatiShakti's approach is driven by *seven*, not six, engines focusing on various infrastructure sectors (Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure). This detail highlights the plan's comprehensive scope.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. The other statements contain inaccuracies concerning the launch year and the number of engines driving the initiative.


**6. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Ministry of Finance is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹5.0 lakh crore over four years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs is located within the Department of Economic Affairs, not the Ministry of Finance.  This distinction reflects the organizational structure of the Indian government.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee does indeed evaluate central sector PPP projects, playing a crucial role in assessing the viability and effectiveness of such partnerships.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore, not ₹5.0 lakh crore, over four years.  This difference in the target amount is a significant detail reflecting the scale of the NMP's ambition.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  The other statements contain errors regarding the location of the Private Investment Unit and the target amount of the NMP.


**7.  With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is a global initiative involving 150 countries and jurisdictions to combat tax avoidance.
2.  Pillar One of the Two-pillar approach focuses on the reallocation of profits of the largest and most profitable Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) to countries where their consumers are present.
3. Pillar Two of the Two-pillar approach aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 20% for MNEs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, though the number is slightly off. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS involves 147 countries and jurisdictions, not 150, aiming to combat tax avoidance and ensure fairer tax practices.  The slight discrepancy doesn't invalidate the core meaning.

Statement 2 is correct. Pillar One of the Two-pillar approach does focus on reallocating profits of large MNEs to the countries where their consumers are located, a key mechanism to address profit shifting.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Pillar Two aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, not 20%, for MNEs. This is a crucial detail reflecting the agreed-upon minimum tax rate under this pillar of the BEPS initiative.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are largely correct. Statement 3 contains an inaccuracy regarding the global minimum corporate tax rate.


**8. With reference to Duty Drawback in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Duty Drawback, under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, rebates customs duty on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods but does not include excisable materials.
2. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) electronically disburses duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts using the Public Finance Management System.
3. Duty Drawback helps exporters offset some of the costs accrued during the export process.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Duty Drawback under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, rebates customs duty on *both* imported and excisable materials used in manufacturing export goods.  This is a key feature of the scheme, aiming to support exporters comprehensively.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBIC does indeed utilize the Public Finance Management System for electronic disbursement of duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' accounts, enhancing efficiency and transparency.

Statement 3 is correct.  Duty Drawback's primary purpose is to help exporters offset some of their costs, making Indian exports more competitive in the global market.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct.  Statement 1 contains an inaccurate representation of the types of materials covered under the Duty Drawback scheme.


**9. With reference to the Windfall Tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A windfall tax is a tax imposed on industries experiencing significantly below-average profits.
2. The Centre has recently increased the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil.
3. A windfall tax is designed to capture excess profits generated due to favourable economic conditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A windfall tax is imposed on industries experiencing *significantly above-average* profits, not below-average profits.  This is a fundamental aspect of the tax's design.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage states the Centre *reduced* the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil, not increased it.  This reflects changes in government policy regarding this specific tax.

Statement 3 is correct. The purpose of a windfall tax is precisely to capture excess profits earned by certain sectors due to exceptionally favorable market conditions or other external factors.

Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct.  The other statements misrepresent the core concept of a windfall tax and the recent policy changes related to it.


**10. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to use trade as an engine for growth and poverty reduction.
2. The EIF is supported by 40 countries and several international organizations.
3. The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) manages the EIF Trust Fund.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The EIF's mandate is precisely to assist LDCs in leveraging trade for economic growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  This is a central aspect of the EIF's work.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF involves 51 countries as partners, not 40.  This numerical detail is important in understanding the framework's global reach.

Statement 3 is correct. UNOPS does manage the EIF Trust Fund, providing crucial administrative and financial support to the initiative.

Statement 3 is correct.  The DBN's primary objective is to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas, aiming to expand connectivity and affordability.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Statement 1 contains an error in the year of the relevant Telecommunications Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The One Future Alliance is indeed a G20 initiative designed to support the implementation of DPI in developing countries.

Statement 3 is correct. The GDPIR was launched with a Social Impact Fund (SIF) to accelerate DPI implementation globally.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct. Statement 1 contains an inaccuracy in the number of layers within India Stack.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Code on Social Security, 2020, did indeed propose the creation of a Social Security Fund and a National Social Security Board to oversee social security provisions for gig and platform workers.

Statement 2 is correct. The E-shram portal aims to connect unorganized workers, including gig workers, with various social security schemes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gig workers are eligible for a PM Suraksha Bima Yojana accidental insurance cover of Rs. 2.0 Lakh, not Rs. 1.0 Lakh, per year. This is a crucial detail regarding the amount of coverage provided.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct. Statement 3 contains an error in the amount of insurance coverage.

1. India currently follows a living wage system, ensuring wages sufficient for a decent standard of living.
2. The Code on Wages, passed in 2019, aims to establish a universal wage floor applicable across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India currently follows a minimum wage system, not a living wage system.  A living wage aims to meet a decent standard of living, while a minimum wage sets a basic floor, often below a living wage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Code on Wages, passed in 2019, does aim to establish a universal wage floor, ensuring a minimum wage across all states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, does *not* specify a uniform minimum wage across all sectors and states.  It provides a framework but allows for variations based on location and industry.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Statements 1 and 3 misrepresent the current wage system and the specifics of the Minimum Wages Act.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. D-SIIs are, by definition, insurers whose distress or failure *would* cause significant disruption to the domestic financial system.  This is the very criterion for their designation.

Statement 2 is correct. The IRDAI does indeed identify D-SIIs based on factors like size, market importance, and interconnectedness, reflecting the systemic risk they pose.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IRDAI has identified more than just the Life Insurance Corporation of India as a D-SII.  The passage mentions General Insurance Corporation of India and New India Assurance Company as well.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Statements 1 and 3 misrepresent the definition of D-SIIs and the number of insurers so designated.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Equalisation Levy was introduced in 2016, not 2017.  This is a key detail in understanding the timeline of this tax.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Equalisation Levy's extension to e-commerce services for Indian residents by non-resident operators involved a levy rate of 2%, not 1%.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage states that India *abolished* the 2% Equalisation Levy affecting non-resident e-commerce companies, not increased it.

Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.  All three statements contain inaccuracies regarding the introduction year, the levy rate, and the recent policy change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ONDC is a Section 8 company, which means it's a *non-profit* organization.  This is a crucial detail about its structure and objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. ONDC's aim is indeed to democratize digital commerce by promoting the inclusion of a wide range of sellers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ONDC uses a *Network-Centric Model*, not a Platform-Centric Model, connecting various platforms and actors in a decentralized manner.  This is a key difference in its design philosophy.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies regarding ONDC's structure and model.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's new PCA framework for UCBs will be effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  This is a crucial detail regarding the implementation timeline.

Statement 2 is correct. The new PCA framework does replace the SAF and applies to most UCBs, excluding those under AID.

Statement 3 is correct.  Capital, asset quality, and profitability are indeed the key monitoring areas under the new PCA framework.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct. Statement 1 contains an error in the effective date of the new framework.



**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council, a constitutional body, is responsible for setting tax rates and making policy decisions related to GST, with the Union Finance Minister serving as its Chairperson.  Decisions require a three-fourths majority of weighted votes, where states collectively hold a two-thirds voting weight.
2.  The GST subsumed various types of excise duty, except for excise duty on petroleum and liquor, which continue to be levied separately.  State Excise duty is now collected by State Governments on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances.
3. The GST Appellate Tribunal, a second appellate authority, hears appeals against orders passed by the Appellate Authority under the CGST Act, 2017, and State GST Acts.  Its principal bench is located in New Delhi, and it includes technical members from both the Centre and States.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the GST system in India. Statement 1 correctly describes the composition and decision-making process of the GST Council, highlighting the weighted voting system that gives states significant influence.  Statement 2 accurately points out that GST replaced many forms of excise duty but did not encompass petroleum and liquor excise duties, which remain under separate tax regimes. The statement also correctly identifies the levying of State Excise duty by state governments on certain goods.  Statement 3 accurately describes the function and structure of the GST Appellate Tribunal, including its location and the involvement of technical members from both central and state governments.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the three statements.


**2. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) and its implications, consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where the import duties on finished goods are higher than the import duties on the input goods used in their manufacture.  This leads to a situation where the GST paid on sales is less than the GST paid on purchases.
2.  One of the impacts of IDS is that it creates working capital issues for taxpayers because their resources remain tied up as Input Tax Credit (ITC) due to high input tax, leading to refund-related problems.
3.  The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has not played any role in addressing concerns related to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because IDS is defined as a situation where import duties (or, more broadly, GST rates) on input goods are *higher* than on finished goods.  The statement reverses this crucial aspect of the definition. Statement 2 accurately describes a significant consequence of IDS—the blockage of working capital due to unutilized ITC and resulting refund difficulties. This creates a cash flow problem for businesses. Statement 3 is incorrect; the provided text explicitly states that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry did engage with the Ministry of Finance to address concerns related to IDS.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions in India, consider the following statements:**

3.  The Lok Sabha's clearance of the Finance Bill, 2024, included amendments to LTCG tax provisions specifically concerning immovable properties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the amendment included a grandfather clause, preserving indexation benefits for properties acquired before the specified cut-off date.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the abolishment of indexation benefits is prospective, not retrospective, meaning it applies only to properties acquired after July 23, 2024.  Statement 3 is correct; the passage clearly states that the Lok Sabha did approve amendments to LTCG provisions related to immovable properties. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**4. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) and related concepts, consider the following statements:**

1.  A DTAA is an agreement between two countries to avoid double taxation on the same asset declared in both countries, aiming to promote cross-border investment by reducing the tax burden on foreign investors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines a DTAA and its purpose in facilitating cross-border investment. Statement 2 is incorrect; the PPT is designed to *prevent* the abuse of treaties for tax evasion, meaning tax benefits are *not* applicable if the primary purpose was to obtain such a benefit. Statement 3 is incorrect because the MAP is available for resolving both juridical and economic double taxation disputes. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over *four*, not five, years (FY22 to FY25).  The timeframe is a significant detail for understanding the NMP's goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects, not solely state-level projects.  The level of government involvement is a key aspect of the committee's function.

Statement 3 is correct. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs does indeed hold responsibility for policy-level matters related to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India.  This highlights the central role of the unit in shaping PPP policy.



**1. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. PMGS NMP utilizes a digital master planning tool developed by the National Institute of Space Applications and Geoinformatics (NISAG) and integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala and Sagarmala projects.
2.  The PM GatiShakti approach is driven by seven engines, including Railways, Roads, and Airports, but excludes Mass Transport and Logistics Infrastructure.
3. PMGS NMP is built on proprietary technology, hosted on a private cloud server, and relies solely on data from the Survey of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) indeed uses a digital master planning tool developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics), leveraging GIS technology.  It integrates data from various ministries, encompassing projects like Bharatmala and Sagarmala.  The use of GIS ensures spatial planning and efficient infrastructure development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti approach explicitly incorporates seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  These sectors are crucial for integrated infrastructure development and efficient logistics.  Excluding Mass Transport and Logistics would contradict the core principle of the initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  PMGS NMP is explicitly built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (the Government of India's cloud), and integrates data from ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.  Relying solely on Survey of India data would limit the scope and accuracy of the plan.  The use of open-source technology promotes transparency and collaboration.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).
3. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for the implementation of all PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  State-level PPP projects typically have their own appraisal mechanisms.  The committee's role is confined to the central government's initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative aimed at generating investment by monetising existing government assets. The target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) reflects the scale of this ambitious plan.  It is a key strategy for attracting private investment and improving infrastructure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs, but it does not handle the implementation of individual projects.  Implementation is typically the responsibility of the relevant ministries and agencies.  The unit sets the broad policy framework.


**3. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 5% per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹5 Crores.
2. The recent expansion of AIF includes allowing convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for individual farmers only, excluding Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).
3. NABARD's wholly-owned subsidiary, NAB Sanrakshan, has been proposed to extend AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs, in addition to CGTMSE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 3% per annum, not 5%, and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹5 Crores.  The lower interest rate and loan limit are crucial aspects of the scheme's design to make it accessible.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The recent expansion of AIF allows convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM not just for individual farmers but also for groups of farmers, FPOs, cooperatives, and Panchayats.  This broader inclusion is designed to benefit a wider range of stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

Statement 3 is correct.  NAB Sanrakshan, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NABARD, has been proposed to extend AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs in addition to CGTMSE. This expansion aims to improve access to credit for FPOs, which play a vital role in agricultural development.

1. The KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) project aims to improve yield estimation by using satellite imagery but not ground-based data.
2. The Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations (FASAL) Project uses remote sensing data, but not ground-based observations.
3.  The Agri Stack initiative's "Kisan ki Pehchaan" component includes creating digital identities for farmers, linking them to land records through geo-referenced village maps and digital crop surveys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The KISAN project utilizes both space technology (satellite imagery) and ground-based data for improved yield estimation.  The combination of these data sources enhances the accuracy and reliability of crop yield forecasts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FASAL project uses a combination of space-based (remote sensing), agro-meteorological, and land-based observations to provide early forecasts of crop output.  Relying solely on remote sensing data would limit the accuracy of the forecasts.

Statement 3 is correct. The Agri Stack initiative's "Kisan ki Pehchaan" component indeed involves creating digital identities for farmers, linking them to land records through geo-referenced village maps, and conducting digital crop surveys. This integration of data is essential for efficient service delivery and scheme implementation.


**5. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Global MPI report, 2024, indicates that India had the second-largest number of people in extreme poverty, after Nigeria.
2. The National MPI (NMPI) in India, introduced in 2021, uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) to measure poverty.
3.  The MPI is a poverty measure that reflects multiple deprivations in education, health, and living standards, and a person is identified as 'MPI poor' if deprived of at least one-third of the weighted indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global MPI report, 2024, states that India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty, not the second largest.  The sheer scale of poverty in India is a significant concern.  The report highlights the need for targeted interventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National MPI (NMPI) in India uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS), to measure multidimensional poverty. The NFHS provides valuable data on health and other relevant indicators.

Statement 3 is correct. The MPI is a composite index that captures multiple deprivations in education, health, and living standards.  A person is classified as 'MPI poor' if they are deprived in at least one-third of the weighted indicators.  This approach provides a more nuanced understanding of poverty than traditional income-based measures.


**6. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revised PSL norms establish an incentive framework for districts with higher credit flow starting from FY25, giving more weight to fresh priority sector loans in such districts.
2.  All bank loans to MSMEs qualify for classification under PSL.
3.  PSL certificates (PSLCs) are non-tradable instruments issued against priority sector loans of banks to help banks meet their PSL targets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised PSL norms establish an incentive framework for districts with *lower*, not higher, credit flow, giving more weight to fresh priority sector loans in such districts to address regional disparities.  The incentive is aimed at increasing credit access in underserved areas.

Statement 2 is correct. All bank loans to MSMEs do qualify for classification under PSL. This reflects the government's focus on supporting the growth of MSMEs, which are vital for employment generation and economic growth.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PSL certificates (PSLCs) are *tradable* instruments, not non-tradable.  The tradability feature allows banks with a surplus of PSL to sell certificates to those with a shortfall, promoting efficient allocation of credit resources.  This market mechanism helps banks meet their targets effectively.


**7. With reference to the  Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), consider the following statements:**

1. MIBOR is a benchmark interest rate that reflects the cost of borrowing in the overnight money market for banks in Mumbai.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended replacing MIBOR with a new benchmark rate based on secured transactions.
3. MIBOR is calculated by averaging the interest rates offered by all scheduled commercial banks in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MIBOR (Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate) is indeed a benchmark interest rate that reflects the cost of borrowing in the short-term money market specifically for banks operating in Mumbai. It plays a crucial role in financial markets.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI has indeed recommended changes to the MIBOR calculation methodology and proposed a transition to a new secured money market benchmark for derivative products to enhance the robustness and reliability of the benchmark rate.  This is a significant development in interest rate benchmarks.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MIBOR is *not* calculated by averaging the interest rates of all scheduled commercial banks across India. It's specifically based on transactions between banks in Mumbai's interbank market and only reflects that specific market segment.  The scope is limited to Mumbai.


**8. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and is mandatory for all products sold in India.
2.  The government can make the ISI mark mandatory for certain products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs).
3.  The ISI mark is a guarantee of product quality and safety but does not cover environmental aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not mandatory for *all* products sold in India. The government makes it mandatory for specific products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs) based on safety and quality concerns.  Not all products require the ISI mark.

Statement 2 is correct.  The government does use Quality Control Orders (QCOs) to make the ISI mark mandatory for specific products. This is a key mechanism for ensuring quality standards.  The QCOs target specific sectors or products.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The ISI mark is a guarantee of product quality and safety. However, while the ISI mark itself doesn't directly cover environmental aspects, BIS has other standards like the Eco Mark for environmentally friendly products.   The ISI mark focuses primarily on quality and safety.


**1. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tariffication, a key aspect of market access under the Agreement, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, thereby eliminating quotas and variable levies.
2.  The "de minimis" limits, under the Agreement's Domestic Support provisions, allow developing countries a higher subsidy threshold (10%) compared to developed countries (5%) based on the value of agricultural production, calculated using a reference price from 1986-88.
3.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 mandated the complete elimination of export subsidies by both developed and developing member countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

Statement 3 is correct in stating that the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 aimed for the complete elimination of export subsidies by all WTO members.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one of the accurate statements.  The agreement's complexity and the nuances within its provisions make it essential to understand all three aspects to fully grasp the implications of the Agreement on Agriculture for different countries and their agricultural sectors.


**2. With reference to the Public Stockholding (PSH) policy and its implications within the WTO framework, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PSH policy enables governments to procure crops from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), store them, and distribute food grains to the poor.
2.  Developing countries advocate for increasing the "de minimis" limits and amending the formula for calculating price support subsidies to accommodate their PSH programs.
3.  Most developed countries argue that PSH programs distort markets and support a complete ban on export restrictions, irrespective of food security concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the ongoing debate surrounding the PSH policy within the WTO. Statement 1 correctly outlines the core objective and functioning of PSH programs. Statement 2 accurately represents the position of developing countries, who argue that the current framework is insufficient for their food security needs. Statement 3 accurately reflects the stance of most developed countries, who view PSH as market-distorting and advocate for stricter limitations.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not encompass the complete picture of the multifaceted perspectives on PSH within the WTO, highlighting the ongoing tension between developed and developing nations regarding trade rules and food security.


**3. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement aims to eliminate harmful fishing subsidies that contribute to the depletion of global fish stocks, providing a transition period for developing countries and LDCs.
2.  The Agreement's entry into force requires acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members, and as of December 2024, it still lacks the required support.
3.  India supports the Agreement, endorsing the "polluter pays principle" and "common but differentiated responsibilities" to address historical overfishing by developed nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only

3.  The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) and PM GatiShakti are initiatives solely focused on enhancing road transport efficiency, neglecting other modes of transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a significant infrastructure project aiming to construct a vast network of national highways, directly impacting the efficiency and capacity of India's road freight transport system.  The stated figure of approximately 65,000 km is accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are a crucial element in the National Rail Plan 2030, aiming to substantially increase the share of rail freight in the country's overall freight transportation. The role of DFCCIL, its incorporation date, and the target percentage increase are all accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While LEEP and PM GatiShakti aim to improve logistics efficiency, their scope is broader than solely focusing on road transport.  PM GatiShakti, in particular, integrates various modes of transport, including railways, waterways, and airways, for a holistic approach to logistics improvement.  The statement's assertion that they *only* focus on road transport is a significant misrepresentation of their objectives and functionality.


**2. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative conceptualized by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), aims to enable instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across multiple countries. The BIS was established in 1930 with its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.
2.  The initiative will initially connect the IPS of four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and India, with an expected launch date of 2026.  It is designed to leverage existing infrastructure and requires no new technological development.
3.  A key objective of Project Nexus is to achieve G20 targets by enabling cheaper, faster, more transparent, and accessible cross-border payments, specifically focusing on reducing transaction fees for remittances sent to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Project Nexus is indeed a multilateral initiative aiming to interconnect domestic instant payment systems for faster cross-border payments.  The BIS's role in conceptualizing the project is accurate. However, the statement incorrectly states that the BIS headquarters are in Zurich. They are actually in Basel, Switzerland.  This minor factual inaccuracy doesn't negate the core correctness of the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The initial participating countries and the target launch date are accurately described. The statement is misleading by implying that no new technology is involved – while it leverages existing IPS, the interconnection and cross-border functionality require substantial technological development and integration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While achieving G20 targets of cheaper, faster, more transparent, and accessible cross-border payments is an objective, the statement's focus on reducing remittance fees *specifically to India* is not a stated primary focus. The aim is broader than that, encompassing all cross-border payments facilitated by the system.


**3. With reference to the Vadhavan Port, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vadhavan Port, located near Dahanu in Maharashtra's Palghar district, will be India's 14th major port upon completion, and will be the largest container port in the country. It is designed to handle only container ships and will not handle other types of cargo.
2.  The port's development is strategically significant due to its integration with the India-Middle East-Economic Corridor (IMEEEC), enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  It will utilize solely public funding and will not involve any Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).
3.  The port's infrastructure will include world-class facilities designed to attract mainline mega-vessels from international shipping lines.  This will significantly boost EXIM trade flows through the IMEEEC and the International North South Transportation Corridor (INSTC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Vadhavan Port is indeed located in Palghar district and will be a major port, the claim that it will be the 14th and handle *only* containers is inaccurate.  The number of major ports and the type of cargo handled may vary.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although integration with the IMEEEC is a key aspect, the assertion that the port will *solely* utilize public funding is false.  The development is likely to involve Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for efficient resource allocation and project completion.

Statement 3 is correct. The development of world-class facilities to attract large vessels and boost EXIM trade through the IMEEEC and INSTC is a central objective of the Vadhavan Port project.


**4. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RELOS agreement, recently approved by Russia, will allow the militaries of both India and Russia to access each other's military bases and ports for logistics support in times of war only.  It excludes access to fuel and rations.
2.  The agreement will facilitate the replenishment of fuel, rations, spare parts, and berthing facilities for troops, warships, and aircraft during both wartime and peacetime missions.  India has similar agreements with the US, Japan, Australia, and France.
3.  RELOS is a bilateral agreement focused solely on military cooperation and does not encompass any aspects of economic or diplomatic relations between India and Russia. This is to ensure that the agreement is not impacted by any political changes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RELOS is designed to provide logistical support during both wartime and peacetime, and the support includes fuel and rations, among other necessities. The statement incorrectly limits the agreement's scope and excludes key elements of logistical support.

Statement 2 is correct.  The agreement's aim to provide comprehensive logistical support during both peacetime and wartime missions is accurately described. The list of countries with similar agreements with India is partially correct but not exhaustive.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While RELOS is primarily focused on military logistics, it's naive to assume it exists entirely separate from broader economic and diplomatic relations.  Such agreements often have indirect impacts on these areas. The statement’s assertion of complete separation is unrealistic.


**5. With reference to Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FVCIs, incorporated outside India and registered under SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, can only invest in venture capital funds registered with SEBI. They are prohibited from investing directly in Indian companies.
2.  A Venture Capital Fund (VCF) is a specialized investment vehicle that primarily focuses on low-risk, low-return investments in established, publicly listed companies.  SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, govern these funds.
3.  The recent amendment to SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, aims to streamline the investment process for FVCIs, making it easier for them to invest in Indian startups and businesses, and potentially increase FDI inflows.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FVCIs can invest in both venture capital funds registered with SEBI *and* directly in venture capital undertakings (unlisted companies) in India. The statement incorrectly restricts their investment options.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) are designed for high-risk, high-return investments in startups and early-stage companies. The statement incorrectly describes VCFs as low-risk, low-return investments in established, listed companies.  The year of the SEBI (VCF) Regulations is correct.

Statement 3 is correct.  The amendment to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations aims to simplify the regulatory framework for FVCIs, facilitating easier investments in Indian businesses and potentially attracting more foreign investment.


**6.  With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1.  DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded through a levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees.  The levy was set at 10% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue.
2.  The DBN's primary objective is to fund telecom schemes in underserved and remote areas, aimed at providing affordable telecom services across the country.  It is managed solely by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
3.  The USOF, the predecessor to DBN, was created under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and its funds were non-lapsable, meaning that unspent funds carried over to subsequent years. This ensured continuity of funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees for the USOF was 5%, not 10%.  The rest of the statement accurately describes the replacement of USOF by DBN and the funding mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. The DBN's core objective of funding telecom initiatives in underserved areas is accurately stated. However, while the DoT plays a major role, it's likely that other agencies might also be involved in the DBN's management and implementation.

Statement 3 is correct. The creation of USOF under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the non-lapsable nature of its funds are accurately described.


**7. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Ministry of Finance is the nodal agency responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs in India. It also directly manages all PPP projects.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, ensuring their financial viability and alignment with government objectives.  This committee is responsible for approving all PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is an initiative that aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, primarily focusing on infrastructure assets.  It is directly managed by the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs (under the Ministry of Finance) plays a key role in PPP policy, it doesn't directly manage individual PPP projects.  The statement overstates its authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee's role in evaluating central sector PPP projects is accurate. However, the statement is misleading by implying that the committee approves *all* projects. The approval process likely involves multiple stakeholders.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the NMP aims to monetise government assets, it's not directly managed by the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee.  The statement incorrectly assigns management responsibility to the appraisal committee.


**8. With reference to India's trade policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme, launched by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, refunds all indirect taxes and levies at the central level on exported products.  It does not include state-level levies.
2. The Trade Connect e-Platform, a single-window initiative, primarily assists large-scale exporters and multinational corporations by providing real-time access to trade-related information. It does not assist MSMEs.
3. The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Commerce, established in 1963 and granted "Deemed to be University" status in 2002.  It focuses on international trade, business research, training, and education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RoDTEP scheme aims to refund indirect taxes and levies at the central, state, and local levels. The statement incorrectly restricts the scheme's scope to only central-level levies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Trade Connect e-Platform is explicitly designed to assist Indian exporters, particularly MSMEs, in accessing trade-related information. The statement incorrectly limits its beneficiaries and excludes MSMEs.

Statement 3 is correct. The information regarding the IIFT's establishment, status, and focus area is accurate.


**9. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the nodal department for formulating FDI policy in India, and it directly approves all FDI proposals.
2. FDI in India is permitted through two routes: the automatic route (government approval not required) and the government route (approval required).  The automatic route is reserved for high-value investments.
3.  Recent data indicates that FDI inflows into India have shown consistent growth in the past fiscal year, exceeding previous years' records.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While DPIIT is the nodal department for FDI policy, it doesn't directly approve all FDI proposals. The approval process involves other agencies and ministries depending on the sector and investment size.

Statement 2 is correct. The two routes for FDI—automatic and government—are accurately described.  The statement is misleading by implying that the automatic route is reserved for high-value investments; it is actually for investments that meet pre-defined criteria.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text states that FDI inflows contracted, not grew, in the given period.  The statement presents inaccurate data on FDI inflow trends.


**10. With reference to India's port sector and related initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. Mormugao Port Authority in Goa was the first port in India to introduce the Green Ship Incentives (Harit Shrey scheme) under the Environmental Ship Index (ESI) platform.  The scheme incentivizes ships with high ESI scores.
2.  Dry ports, also known as inland ports, are inland terminals that provide connectivity to seaports via rail or road.  They primarily benefit coastal states by reducing congestion at major seaports.
3. The Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) 2023, released by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence, ranked Yangshan Port (China) as the top-performing container port globally.  Indian ports did not feature in the top 100.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mormugao Port's pioneering role in introducing the Harit Shrey scheme under ESI is accurately described. The scheme's objective to incentivize environmentally friendly shipping practices is also correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dry ports primarily benefit landlocked states and regions by providing efficient access to international trade, reducing reliance on coastal ports.  The statement misrepresents the primary beneficiaries of dry ports.

Statement 3 is partially correct in identifying Yangshan Port as the top-ranked container port. However, it incorrectly claims that no Indian ports featured in the top 100; the given text states that nine Indian ports did feature.


**1. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions, but excludes geographical indications.
2.  The TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing only for pharmaceutical products, not for patented processes.
3. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement explicitly permits member states to prioritize public health concerns over intellectual property rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) does indeed incorporate provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions.  Crucially, it also includes geographical indications, which are signs used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are essentially attributable to that place of origin.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  Statement 2 is also false; the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing for patented products *and* processes, a significant flexibility afforded to developing countries to address public health crises or national needs.  This is a crucial aspect for countries lacking the resources or infrastructure to produce essential medicines or technologies under patent.  Statement 3 is correct. The Doha Declaration explicitly acknowledges the importance of public health, affirming that the TRIPS Agreement should not prevent members from taking measures necessary to protect public health, and that members can fully utilize the flexibilities within the agreement to achieve this.  This declaration provides a critical legal basis for countries to implement compulsory licensing or other measures to ensure access to essential medicines.


**2. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF in India consistently remained above 25% of GDP from independence until economic liberalization.
2.  Private investment, as a percentage of GDP, experienced a consistent upward trend from the 1980s to 2020-21.
3. The term 'crowding out' describes a situation where increased government spending, financed through borrowing, leads to higher interest rates, thereby reducing private investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF fluctuated, it did not consistently remain above 25% of GDP before economic liberalization.  The period before liberalization saw investment levels generally below or slightly above 10% of GDP.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. Private investment, while showing an increase in the 1980s, did not experience a consistent upward trend until 2020-21.  There was a significant drop in private investment from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a low point in 2020-21 before starting to rise again. This highlights the volatility and challenges faced by private investment in India. Statement 3 accurately describes the concept of "crowding out."  Increased government borrowing can indeed drive up interest rates, making it more expensive for private businesses to borrow and invest.  This phenomenon can negatively impact private sector growth and investment, highlighting a critical trade-off in macroeconomic policy.


**3. With reference to the Monetary Policy of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's monetary policy framework is solely determined by the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee, without any involvement from the central government.
2.  The current inflation target under the flexible inflation targeting framework is 6% with a tolerance band of +/-2%.
3. The process by which RBI's policy rate changes impact economic variables is known as monetary policy transmission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) plays a crucial role in formulating monetary policy, the central government, in consultation with the RBI, determines the inflation target every five years. This reflects a collaborative approach to macroeconomic policymaking. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The current inflation target under the flexible inflation targeting framework is 4%, not 6%, with a tolerance band of +/-2%.  This 4% target is a key indicator of the RBI's commitment to price stability. Statement 3 accurately defines monetary policy transmission. It refers to the mechanism through which changes in policy rates by the RBI affect other economic variables such as inflation, investment, and overall economic activity.  Understanding monetary policy transmission is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of monetary policy actions.


**4. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All loans with values less than ₹10,00,000 to individuals belonging to low-income households are classified as microfinance loans by the RBI.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans exclusively to women-owned micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
3. The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a framework for regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating in microfinance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households, the loan value limit is ₹3,00,000, not ₹10,00,000.  This distinction is important for understanding the scope and scale of microfinance lending in India. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, not exclusively to women-owned enterprises.  While women entrepreneurs are significant beneficiaries, the scheme is broader in its scope. Statement 3 is correct. The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) did indeed recommend a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs. This recommendation was crucial in formalizing and improving the regulatory oversight of the microfinance sector in India.


**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial exclusion.
2. The FI-Index incorporates data from banking, investments, insurance, and the postal sector, but excludes the pension sector.
3.  The FI-Index is published annually in July.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FI-Index ranges from 0 to 100, but 0 represents complete financial exclusion, and 100 represents complete financial inclusion.  This is a crucial distinction for understanding the index's interpretation. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The FI-Index does indeed include data from banking, investments, insurance, and the postal sector; importantly, it *also* includes data from the pension sector, providing a comprehensive view of financial inclusion across various financial services.  Statement 3 is correct. The RBI publishes the FI-Index annually in July, providing an up-to-date assessment of financial inclusion progress across the country.  This regular publication facilitates monitoring and evaluation of policies aimed at promoting financial inclusion.


**6.  With reference to the RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework will be implemented from April 1, 2026, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs regardless of their tier categorization or whether they are under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are key monitoring areas under the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date of the PCA framework for UCBs is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2026. This date is important for understanding the timeline of regulatory changes in the UCB sector. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The PCA framework does not apply to all UCBs.  It specifically excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID). This exception is important to note for a complete understanding of the framework's scope.  Statement 3 is correct.  Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are indeed key monitoring areas under the PCA framework.  These three parameters are crucial indicators of a bank's financial health and are used to trigger PCA measures when thresholds are breached.


**7. With reference to the RBI's Ways and Means Advances (WMA) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The WMA scheme is available only to State Governments and not to the Union Government.
2.  Special WMA (now known as Special Drawing Facility – SDF) carries a higher interest rate compared to Normal WMA.
3.  Overdraft facilities are an alternative financial accommodation instrument available to States/UTs besides WMA and SDF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WMA scheme is available to both State Governments and the Union Government. This facility is crucial for managing temporary cash flow mismatches.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Special WMA (SDF) has a lower interest rate than the Normal WMA, not a higher one.  This reflects the different risk profiles associated with these two types of advances.  Statement 3 is correct.  Overdraft facilities are indeed an alternative financial accommodation instrument available to States/UTs in addition to WMA and SDF, offering another option for managing temporary cash flow imbalances.


**8. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 5% per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE.
2.  The AIF’s scope has been recently expanded to include integrated primary and secondary processing projects.
3.  The AIF allows convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for individual farmers but not for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 3%, not 5%, per annum.  This difference is significant for understanding the financial support offered under the scheme. Statement 2 is correct.  The scope of the AIF has been recently expanded to include integrated primary and secondary processing projects, broadening its reach within the agricultural sector.  This expansion is important for promoting value addition and enhancing the income of farmers.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The AIF allows convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for both individual farmers and FPOs. This convergence is crucial for promoting solar energy adoption in agriculture.


**9. With reference to the  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  NUCFDC's primary function includes providing liquidity and capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
3. The need for an umbrella organization for India’s UCB sector was first proposed by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  This distinction is important for understanding its regulatory classification and operational capabilities. Statement 2 is correct.  Providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs is a primary function of NUCFDC. This support is crucial for strengthening the financial health and stability of the UCB sector. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006, not Shri V.S. Das.  While a model was later recommended by a working group led by Shri V.S. Das in 2009, the initial proposal came from the Viswanathan committee.


**10. With reference to the  Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RB-IOS covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), including Housing Finance Companies.
2.  The RB-IOS is formed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the RBI Act, 1934, but excludes the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.
3. The primary objective of the RB-IOS is to provide a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer grievances against regulated entities of the RBI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS does not cover all NBFCs; it specifically excludes Housing Finance Companies. This exclusion is important for understanding the scope of the scheme's coverage. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RB-IOS is formed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  All three acts are foundational to the scheme's legal basis. Statement 3 is correct. The primary objective of the RB-IOS is to provide a cost-free and efficient mechanism for redressing customer complaints related to services provided by RBI-regulated entities.  This cost-free aspect is crucial for ensuring accessibility for all customers.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. The HDR, released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 1990, primarily focuses on economic growth indicators.
2. The Human Development Index (HDI), a core component of the HDR, was developed by Amartya Sen.
3. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) within the HDR assesses inequalities across various dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The HDR examines major global challenges affecting human development, encompassing social and environmental factors beyond mere economic growth.  While economic factors are considered, the HDR's scope is much broader.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The HDI was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq, not Amartya Sen, although Sen's work on capabilities significantly influenced the HDI's conceptual framework.

Statement 3 is correct. The GII is a crucial part of the HDR, measuring gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.  This accurately reflects the index's purpose.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**2. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 MPI report, published by the World Bank, revealed that India has the lowest number of people living in extreme poverty among the countries surveyed.
2. The MPI considers deprivations in education, health, and living standards to determine multidimensional poverty.
3.  The MPI is solely focused on monetary poverty and income levels.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report, jointly published by UNDP and OPHI (not the World Bank), indicated that India had the largest number of people living in extreme multidimensional poverty, not the lowest.

Statement 2 is correct. The MPI is a multidimensional measure of poverty, encompassing deprivations across education, health, and living standards.  It goes beyond simply considering income.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The MPI explicitly considers factors beyond monetary poverty, recognizing that poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon.  It directly contradicts the core concept of the MPI. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**3.  With reference to India's seaweed farming, consider the following statements:**

2.  The estate duty, introduced in India in 1953, was abolished in 1985 due to its low tax rates and widespread popularity.
3.  The gift tax, abolished in 1998, was re-introduced in 2004, with any gift exceeding ₹50,000 in a financial year being added to the recipient's income from other sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India currently does not levy an inheritance tax.  The text explicitly states that there is no inheritance tax in India.  The comparison to estate taxes in Japan and the USA is accurate, but the presence of such a tax in India is false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The estate duty was abolished in 1985, but not due to its low tax rate or popularity.  The text indicates that the high tax rate (up to 85%) made it unpopular, leading to its abolition.  The statement reverses the fact regarding the tax rate and its impact on public opinion.

Statement 3 is partially correct in stating the gift tax was abolished in 1998 and re-introduced in 2004. However, it incorrectly states that *any* gift exceeding ₹50,000 is taxed.  The text clarifies that there are exceptions, including donations, inheritance, and gifts from close relatives. The statement oversimplifies the tax rules and creates a misleading impression.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**2. With reference to India's wealth inequality, consider the following statements:**

1.  According to the World Inequality Lab's study, the top 1% of the Indian population controls approximately 25% of the total wealth, while the bottom 50% holds roughly 10% of the total wealth.
2.  The Commitment to Reducing Inequality (CRI) Index 2024 ranked India below Nepal and Sri Lanka, indicating a relatively better performance in reducing inequality compared to its South Asian neighbors.
3.  Inequality in India has consistently increased since independence, showing no periods of decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Inequality Lab study actually shows that the top 1% controls over 40% of total wealth, while the bottom 50% holds only 6.4%.  The figures presented in the statement are significantly lower than the actual data, creating a misleading impression of less wealth inequality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CRI Index 2024 did rank India 127th out of 164 countries, the statement incorrectly claims that India performed better than Nepal and Sri Lanka.  The text explicitly states that Nepal (115) and Sri Lanka (118) ranked higher than India (127), indicating a worse performance in reducing inequality.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that inequality in India declined post-independence, began rising in the 1980s, and skyrocketed since the 2000s. This demonstrates that there was a period of decline in inequality after independence, contradicting the statement.


**3. With reference to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) signed a record-breaking 100 APAs in FY 2023-24, demonstrating a significant increase in their utilization by Indian taxpayers.
2.  APAs are agreements between the tax authorities and taxpayers to determine the appropriate transfer pricing for international transactions, aiming to reduce tax disputes.
3.  APAs are exclusively bilateral agreements between India and other countries, excluding any unilateral agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in its number. The CBDT signed 125 APAs (including unilateral and bilateral) in FY 2023-24, not 100. However, it is correct in stating that this was a record number.  The slight numerical inaccuracy does not invalidate the core meaning of the statement about the increase in APA utilization.

Statement 2 is correct. APAs are indeed agreements between tax authorities and taxpayers to determine transfer pricing for international transactions, aiming to minimize tax disputes and provide certainty for both parties.  This is a core function of APAs globally.

Statement 3 is incorrect. APAs can be either bilateral (between two countries) or unilateral (where only one country's tax authorities are involved). The text explicitly mentions both unilateral and bilateral APAs being signed.


**4. With reference to India's multimodal logistics parks, consider the following statements:**

1. The government's plan for 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) involves a total investment outlay of $5 billion.
2.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 50,000 km of National Highways in two phases.
3.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) project, under the purview of DFCCIL, aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic to 55% by 2030.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The investment outlay for the 35 MMLPs is stated as $6.2 billion, not $5 billion.  This is a significant difference that renders the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways, not 50,000 km.  Again, the numerical discrepancy significantly alters the meaning of the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The target share of rail freight traffic for the DFCs by 2030 is 45%, not 55%.  The incorrect percentage undermines the factual accuracy of the statement.


**5. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  India Stack's identity layer primarily relies on the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) for digital identity services, while the payment layer predominantly uses the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS).
2. The One Future Alliance initiative, proposed by the G20 India Presidency, focuses solely on providing financial aid to Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) for DPI implementation.
3. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was announced at the G20 summit in 2022 and includes a Social Impact Fund (SIF) to accelerate DPI implementation globally.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aadhaar is a key component of India Stack's identity layer,  the statement incorrectly mentions IMPS as the primary payment layer.  The text clearly states that UPI is the primary payment layer.  The substitution of IMPS for UPI is a crucial factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The One Future Alliance aims to build capacity *and* provide technical assistance and funding support, not solely financial aid. The statement omits the crucial elements of capacity building and technical assistance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GDPIR was announced at the G20 virtual leaders' summit in 2023, not 2022. The year is incorrect, and the statement also presents an inaccurate timeline.


**6. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  UPI was launched in 2018 and is operated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an organization established under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2005.
2.  NIPL, a subsidiary of NPCI, has partnered with several countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, to expand UPI's international reach.
3.  NPCI was established through a joint initiative of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UPI was launched in 2016, not 2018, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act is from 2007, not 2005. Both the launch year and the act year are inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NIPL is indeed working to internationalize UPI, the statement inaccurately includes the UK and Canada as partner countries. The text mentions other countries like Sri Lanka, Mauritius, France, UAE, Singapore, Bhutan, and Nepal.

Statement 3 is correct. NPCI was indeed established jointly by the RBI and IBA under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  This is an accurate reflection of the organization's founding.


**7. With reference to India's renewable energy sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  IREDA, a non-banking financial institution under the Ministry of Power, obtained Navratna status based on its consistently excellent MoU ratings over the past five years.
2.  SECI, a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, achieved Miniratna Category-II status before being granted Navratna status.
3.  To be eligible for Miniratna Category-I status, a CPSE must have continuously made profits for the last five years and have a pre-tax profit exceeding ₹40 crores in at least one of those years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IREDA is under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not the Ministry of Power. The ministry is wrongly mentioned.  The statement also incorrectly states that Navratna status was based on consistently excellent MoU ratings over five years. The text mentions three out of the last five years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text does not specify whether SECI achieved Miniratna Category-II status before being granted Navratna status. The statement makes an assumption not supported by the provided information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The requirement for Miniratna Category-I status is a pre-tax profit of ₹30 crores or more in at least one of the last three years, not ₹40 crores and not over five years.  The amounts and time periods are both inaccurate.


**8. With reference to the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City)-IFSC, established as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in 2010, serves as India's primary gateway for international financial services.
2.  The IFSCA, established under the IFSC Act, 2019, regulates all activities within IFSCs, including those related to book-keeping, accounting, taxation, and financial crime compliance.
3.  An expert committee was formed to develop GIFT IFSC as a global finance and accounting hub, following a Ministry of Commerce notification that classified relevant activities as financial services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GIFT City-IFSC was established in 2015, not 2010. The year is wrong. It also incorrectly states that it's India's *primary* gateway; the text only states it *aims* to become a gateway.

Statement 2 is correct. IFSCA, established under the IFSC Act, 2019, regulates activities within IFSCs, including those mentioned. This is accurately reflected in the text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The committee was formed following a Ministry of Finance notification, not a Ministry of Commerce notification.  The ministry is incorrectly specified.


**9. With reference to India's trade deficit, consider the following statements:**

1.  India recorded a trade surplus with 8 out of its top 10 trading partners during FY 2023-24.
2.  A trade deficit occurs when a country's value of imports is less than its value of exports.
3.  A higher trade deficit can lead to a depletion of foreign exchange reserves and a depreciation of the domestic currency.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that India recorded a trade *deficit* with 9 out of its top 10 trading partners, not a surplus.  The statement completely reverses the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A trade deficit occurs when the value of imports *exceeds* the value of exports, not the other way around.  The statement misdefines a trade deficit.

Statement 3 is correct. A higher trade deficit does indeed deplete foreign exchange reserves (needed to pay for imports) and can lead to currency depreciation.  This accurately reflects the economic consequences of a trade deficit.


**10. With reference to India's technical textiles sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's technical textiles market is currently the third-largest globally.
2.  The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as the world's leading producer of technical textiles within the next five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India's technical textiles market is the *fifth* largest globally, not the third-largest.  The ranking is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states the mission aims to position India as a *global leader*, but doesn't specify a timeframe of five years or any specific timeframe. The statement adds an unsupported timeframe.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly mentions the PLI scheme for textiles and the PM MITRA scheme as government initiatives to support the technical textiles sector.  These are accurately described.




**1. With reference to India's agricultural data infrastructure, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes artificial intelligence and remote sensing but excludes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in its decision-making processes.
2.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) primarily focuses on farmer identity, crop-sown data, and soil health data, neglecting geotagged farm location.
3.  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And Geoinformatics) solely improves yield estimation and does not contribute to crop insurance schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  The ICCC explicitly uses GIS alongside AI and remote sensing for informed decision-making in agriculture. ADeX indeed includes geotagged farm location as one of its three primary datasets, alongside farmer identity and crops-sown data.  KISAN is directly involved in improving crop insurance processes by leveraging space technology and geoinformatics for better yield estimation, making it a crucial component of the crop insurance system. The statements misrepresent the functionalities and components of these crucial agricultural data initiatives.  They incorrectly omit key functionalities or attribute incorrect functionalities to these systems, demonstrating a lack of understanding of their roles in modernizing Indian agriculture.

1.  The MSP covers 20 crops, including 12 Kharif crops, 5 Rabi crops, and 3 commercial crops, excluding jute and copra.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
3.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency responsible for all MSP-procured crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The MSP actually covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra).  While CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision-making authority is the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  Finally, while FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the *sole* agency responsible for all MSP-procured crops; other agencies also participate in the procurement process.  These inaccuracies demonstrate a misunderstanding of the key players and the scope of the MSP system in India.


**3. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports increased by 8% in 2023-24, exceeding the target of $60 billion set by the 2018 policy.
2.  Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices.
3.  The share of India's agricultural exports in the world agriculture trade in 2022 was over 5%, making India a leading exporter.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Agricultural exports in India registered an 8% *decline* in 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target. While rice is a significant export, marine products actually hold a larger share of total exports than rice.  Finally, India's share of agricultural exports in the world trade was only 2.4% in 2022, far from being a leading exporter.  These inaccuracies highlight a significant misunderstanding of the current state of India's agricultural export performance and its position in the global market.


**4. With reference to the initiatives for promoting agricultural exports in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) primarily focuses on improving domestic infrastructure and does not directly support export linkages.
2. The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme adopts a product-specific approach, neglecting country-specific market analysis.
3. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) is solely responsible for the registration of Geographical Indications (GIs) for Indian products abroad and does not handle trademark applications.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. TIES directly supports the development and upgrading of infrastructure crucial for exports, including border haats and cold chains. The MAI Scheme uses a focus product-focus country approach, considering both product-specific and country-specific aspects.  APEDA is involved in both GI registration and trademark applications for Indian products abroad, not just GI registration. The incorrect statements demonstrate a lack of understanding of the specific roles and functions of these export promotion schemes and the APEDA's responsibilities.


**5. With reference to the livestock sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India ranks first globally in the average annual productivity of cattle.
2. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are genomic chips developed for poultry and pigs, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. India's average annual cattle productivity is significantly lower than the global average. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are for cattle and buffaloes, not poultry and pigs.  The Sustainable Livestock Health and Production Scheme aims to improve both livestock health and productivity, directly addressing issues like antimicrobial resistance and low productivity. The inaccuracies in the statements reflect a superficial understanding of the challenges and initiatives within India's livestock sector.


**6.  With reference to India's oilseed production and self-sufficiency initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  Over 75% of oilseed cultivation in India is irrigated, ensuring consistent yields despite varying rainfall patterns.
2.  The National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) primarily focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation in the southern states of India.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) only ensures MSP through a price deficiency payment scheme and does not involve a price support scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  A significant portion of oilseed cultivation in India is rainfed, making yields vulnerable to variations in rainfall. NMEO-OP focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation across various regions, including North Eastern States and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, not solely in southern states. PM-AASHA employs both price support and price deficiency payment schemes to ensure that oilseed farmers receive the MSP. The incorrect information presented demonstrates a lack of knowledge about the specifics of oilseed production and government initiatives in India.


**7. With reference to millets in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India accounts for less than 10% of global millet production.
2.  The stagnant production of millets is primarily attributed to high consumer preference for fine cereals and not to yield gaps.
3.  The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industry for Millet-based products (PLISMBP) aims to reduce the shelf life of millet products.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. India accounts for a substantial portion (around 20%) of global millet production. Stagnant millet production is due to several factors including yield gaps, labor shortages, and consumer preferences. PLISMBP aims to boost the processing and marketing of millet-based products, not to reduce their shelf life.  The incorrect information reveals a lack of understanding of the facts related to millet production, consumption, and government initiatives.


**8. With reference to the SPICED scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The SPICED scheme primarily focuses on the expansion of pepper cultivation and does not include cardamom.
2. The scheme's implementation is limited to a single financial year.
3. The scheme's major components exclude market expansion efforts and focus solely on improving productivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The SPICED scheme specifically aims to expand the area under cardamom cultivation and improve its productivity. The scheme's implementation spans multiple years, from 2023-24 to 2025-26. Market expansion efforts are a major component of the scheme, along with productivity improvements and other initiatives. The incorrect information highlights a lack of awareness about the goals and components of the SPICED scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Seaweed farming's contribution to India's GDP is significantly less than 5%. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana targets 1 million tons of seaweed production, not 500,000 tons. The GIS-based portal aims to make information on seaweed cultivation sites more accessible, not to restrict access. The inaccuracies demonstrate a lack of familiarity with the current status of seaweed farming and related initiatives in India.


**10. With reference to the Central Silk Board and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA), consider the following statements:**

1. India is the largest silk producer globally.
2. Karnataka contributes the least to India's total silk production.
3.  NISA celebrated its 50th anniversary recently.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  India is the second largest silk producer, not the largest. Karnataka is a major contributor to India's silk production, not the least. NISA celebrated its 100th, not 50th, anniversary. The incorrect information reveals a misunderstanding of the facts related to India's silk production and the history of NISA.

The inaccuracies demonstrate a lack of understanding of the AIF's scope and recent modifications.


**12. With reference to Agri-tech initiatives in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FASAL Project was launched in 2015 to provide real-time information on crop conditions.
2. KISAN primarily focuses on improving access to agricultural credit and not yield estimation.
3.  The WEF's AI for Agriculture Innovation (AI4AI) initiative exclusively focuses on the development of new AI algorithms for agriculture and not on scaling agritech services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  The FASAL Project was launched in 2005, not 2015. KISAN is directly related to yield estimation for crop insurance purposes. The WEF's AI4AI initiative explicitly aims to scale agritech services through public-private partnerships in addition to algorithm development.  The errors reflect insufficient knowledge of the specific details and goals of various Agri-tech initiatives in India.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural exports:**

1.  Rice constitutes the largest share (over 25%) of India's total agricultural exports, followed by marine products.
2.  India's share of the global agricultural export market in 2022 was below 2%.
3.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) primarily focuses on improving domestic agricultural infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While rice is a significant agricultural export for India, the provided text states it constitutes 21% of total exports, not over 25%. Marine products hold the second-largest share (15%), indicating rice does not hold the largest share.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions India's share of world agricultural exports in 2022 was 2.4%, which is below 2%.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) is explicitly described as assisting in setting up and upgrading infrastructure projects with *overwhelming export linkages*. This directly contradicts the statement that it focuses primarily on domestic infrastructure.  The scheme's purpose is to enhance India's capacity for agricultural exports, not solely domestic consumption.  Therefore, the statement misrepresents the scheme's objective.



**2. With reference to India's agricultural imports, consider the following statements:**

1.  Pulses constitute the largest share of India's agricultural imports, exceeding 50%.
2.  Vegetable oil accounts for a significant portion (over 40%) of India's agricultural imports.
3.  India's share of the global agricultural import market in 2022 was higher than its share of the export market.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that vegetable oil constitutes 45% of imports, while pulses account for 11%.  This directly refutes the claim that pulses form the largest import share.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that vegetable oil makes up 45% of India's agricultural imports, well above 40%.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the exact figures aren't directly comparable to allow for definitive statement, the text shows that India's share of the global agricultural *export* market (2.4%) was slightly higher than its *import* share (1.9%) in 2022.  The statement incorrectly asserts the opposite.



**3. Consider the following statements about the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme:**

1.  The MAI Scheme focuses solely on promoting the export of rice and marine products.
2.  The MAI Scheme employs a product-country focused approach to expand market access.
3.  The MAI Scheme primarily utilizes data from the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) for market analysis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of the MAI Scheme states that it's formulated on a "focus product-focus country approach". This implies a broader scope than just rice and marine products.  The scheme aims to promote various agricultural products to specific countries based on market analysis, not limiting it to just these two products.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly describes the MAI Scheme as using a "focus product-focus country approach". This is a clear description of a product-country focused strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While APEDA plays a role in promoting agricultural exports, the text doesn't specify that the MAI scheme relies *primarily* or exclusively on APEDA data. The scheme might use data from various sources for market studies and surveys, not limited to APEDA. The statement lacks sufficient evidence from the given text.



**4. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSP covers more than 25 agricultural crops, including all major oilseeds.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all crops.
3.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the primary procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the MSP covers 22 crops, not more than 25.  While it includes major Kharif and Rabi crops, it doesn't explicitly state that *all* major oilseeds are covered. The statement overstates the number of covered crops.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the CACP recommends MSPs, the text clearly states that the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister. The statement incorrectly attributes sole decision-making power to the CACP.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FCI is mentioned as the nodal agency for wheat and paddy procurement, not all MSP-covered crops.  The statement wrongly generalizes the FCI's role to all MSP crops.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding India's oilseed production:**

1.  Less than 70% of oilseed cultivation in India is rainfed.
2.  Groundnut production is concentrated in a few states, contributing a significant majority (over 80%) of the national total.
3.  The National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) primarily focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation in the southern states of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation is rainfed, contradicting the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka collectively contribute 83.4% of India's groundnut production, exceeding the 80% threshold.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NMEO-OP aims to expand oil palm cultivation, the text specifically mentions a focus on North Eastern States and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, not primarily the southern states.  The statement misrepresents the geographical focus of the scheme.


**6. With reference to India's millet production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India accounts for more than 80% of global millet production.
2.  The stagnation in millet production is primarily attributed to a lack of government support and inadequate storage facilities.
3.  Millets are a rich source of minerals but have a high Glycemic Index, limiting their health benefits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India accounts for 20% of *global* millet production, not more than 80%.  While it accounts for a large portion of *Asia's* production (nearly 80%), the statement misrepresents the global share.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions yield gaps due to labor shortages and insufficient fertilizers, and storage issues due to shorter shelf life, it doesn't attribute stagnation *primarily* to a lack of government support.  The statement oversimplifies the reasons for stagnant production.  The shift in consumer preferences and MSP-backed procurement schemes for fine cereals is another cause.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that millets have a *low* Glycemic Index, which is a health benefit, not a limitation. The statement presents inaccurate information about the Glycemic Index of millets.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the National Technical Textiles Mission aims to position India as a global leader in technical textiles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that several Central ministries/departments have been mandated to use technical textiles, it does not state that *all* sectors of the Indian economy are mandated to do so. The statement overgeneralizes the scope of the mandate.

Statement 3 is correct. The text lists the PLI scheme for textiles as one of the schemes under the National Technical Textiles Mission.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI):**

1.  The ICI includes more than eight core industries and constitutes over 50% of the weight of items in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2. Petroleum Refinery Products have the lowest weight in the ICI.
3. The ICI is released by the Ministry of Finance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the ICI measures the combined performance of *eight* core industries and that they comprise 40.27% of the IIP weight, not over 50%.  The statement is factually incorrect on both counts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Petroleum Refinery Products have the *highest* weight (28.04%) in the ICI. The statement presents the opposite of the actual fact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the ICI is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the Ministry of Finance.  The statement attributes the release to the wrong ministry.


**10. With reference to the Navratna status granted to public sector undertakings, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Public Enterprises is responsible for granting Navratna status.
2.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Power.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Department of Public Enterprises granted Navratna status to IREDA and SECI.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that IREDA is under the administrative control of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, not the Ministry of Power.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The grant of Navratna status does not automatically imply privatization. It grants greater autonomy and operational flexibility to the PSU, but it doesn't necessarily lead to privatization.  The statement incorrectly links Navratna status with privatization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text mentions the World Bank report analyzing PPP regulatory landscapes across 140 economies, but it does not specify India's ranking.  We cannot ascertain India's precise ranking from the given information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. The text doesn't explicitly state its involvement in state-level projects.  State-level PPP projects likely have their own evaluation mechanisms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets, not through privatization of government-owned enterprises.  Monetization differs from outright privatization; it involves generating revenue from existing assets without necessarily transferring ownership.


**3. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR, published annually by the World Bank, includes the Human Development Index (HDI) as its core component.
2.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across various dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation, and India's rank improved significantly in 2022.
3. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the overall loss in HDI due to inequality, and India's rank improved in 2022 compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that from independence to economic liberalization, investment remained slightly above or below 10% of GDP, not consistently above 20%. This is a significant difference in the magnitude of investment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly indicates that private investment hit a low of 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21.

Statement 3 is correct. The explanation of the "crowding out" effect accurately describes the phenomenon where increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, reducing private sector investment.

3. The second NAFIS report offers insights into the changes in rural economic and financial indicators since 2016-17, but does not provide data on the impact of specific government policies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While financial literacy is a component, NAFIS offers a broader overview of rural livelihoods and financial inclusion encompassing loans, insurance, and pensions.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  NAFINdex's measurement of financial inclusion is more comprehensive than just formal banking services; it considers a wider range of financial products and services.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states Vadhvan Port will be the *13th* major port in India, not the 14th.  The claim that it will surpass *all* other existing major ports in container handling capacity is also an overstatement; while it's designed to be large, the text doesn't provide comparative data to support this assertion.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Mormugao Port as the first in India to introduce the Harit Shrey scheme, which incentivizes green shipping practices based on ESI scores. This aligns with global decarbonization efforts.

Statement 3 is largely correct. While the exact date of inauguration of the first dry port might differ slightly depending on the source, the fact that Bihar's first dry port was inaugurated near Patna is mentioned in the text. The statement accurately reflects the purpose of dry ports in improving logistics and reducing pressure on coastal ports.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dr. Verghese Kurien is indeed credited with leading the original White Revolution, a significant initiative that transformed India's dairy sector. His contributions are widely acknowledged and celebrated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission's primary focus is on the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, not directly on improving the quality of milk and milk products. While improved breeds can lead to better quality milk, the mission's stated goals are breed-centric.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) aims to enhance the quality of milk and milk products and increase the share of organized milk procurement, strengthening infrastructure.  The focus on indigenous breeds is primarily under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission.


**5. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for the implementation of individual PPP projects.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to increase private sector participation by leasing government assets for a period of 10 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs, not the direct implementation of individual projects. Implementation is handled at the project level by various agencies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a crucial role in evaluating central sector PPP projects, ensuring their feasibility and alignment with government objectives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).  The statement incorrectly specifies a 10-year lease period.  The NMP involves various monetization strategies, not just leasing for a fixed term.


**6. With reference to the  Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. KVKs are primarily funded by individual state governments.
2. The first KVK was established in 1974 in Puducherry.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. KVKs are 100% financed by the Centre, not individual state governments. This centralized funding ensures consistency in their operations and objectives across the country.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage correctly identifies the establishment of the first KVK in 1974 in Puducherry under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

Statement 3 is correct. KVKs are explicitly described as functioning as knowledge and resource centers at the district level, providing technological backstopping for agriculture and allied sectors.  This is a key aspect of their role within the National Agricultural Research System (NARS).


**7. With reference to the  Co-operative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  RBI's revised NPA provisioning norms for co-operative banks mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be added to the bank's capital reserves.
2. Under co-lending arrangements, banks and NBFCs can co-lend to any sector without any restrictions on risk sharing.
3. A co-operative bank must have a minimum of two hundred members to be eligible for operation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The revised norms mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account, not added to capital reserves.  This is a crucial distinction in accounting treatment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While banks and NBFCs can co-lend to priority sectors, there are restrictions.  A minimum of 20% credit risk must be borne by the NBFC, with the remaining risk on the bank.  The statement omits these crucial risk-sharing stipulations.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage states that a key criterion for a co-operative bank is having not less than two hundred members. This is a regulatory requirement for its operation.


**8. With reference to the  Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. D-SIIs are identified based solely on their market capitalization.
2. The distress or failure of a D-SII would have minimal impact on the domestic financial system.
3. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is categorized as a D-SII.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The identification of D-SIIs is not based solely on market capitalization. It considers multiple factors, including size, market importance, and domestic and global interconnectedness.  Market cap is one factor among many.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The defining characteristic of a D-SII is that its distress or failure *would* cause significant dislocation in the domestic financial system.  This is precisely why they receive heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly names LIC as one of the insurers identified as a D-SII by IRDAI. This highlights its significant systemic importance within the Indian financial landscape.


**9. With reference to the  Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EIF is a bilateral partnership focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
2. The EIF receives funding support from international organizations like the World Bank and WTO.
3.  The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) manages the EIF Trust Fund.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF is described as a *multilateral* partnership, not a bilateral one.  It involves multiple countries and organizations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage mentions that the EIF receives support from international organizations such as the World Bank and the WTO. This underscores the multilateral nature of its funding and governance.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that UNOPS serves as the EIF Trust Fund Manager.  This highlights UNOPS's crucial role in overseeing the financial resources of the EIF.



**10. With reference to the  Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. DBN was established to replace the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) which was created under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
2. DBN funds are generated through a levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.
3. DBN primarily focuses on funding telecom infrastructure projects in urban areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that DBN, established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaced the USOF, which was created under the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  This reflects a shift in the regulatory framework for telecom funding.

Statement 2 is correct. The USOF, which DBN replaced, was funded by a Universal Access Levy (5% of Adjusted Gross Revenue) charged on telecom licensees. While the exact mechanism for DBN funding might differ slightly, the underlying principle of a levy on telecom revenue remains.

Statement 3 is incorrect. DBN's purpose is explicitly to fund telecom schemes in underserved remote/rural areas at affordable prices.  Urban areas are not the primary focus of DBN's funding initiatives.  The aim is to bridge the digital divide.


**1. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
2.  The plan integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN, but excludes data on inland waterways projects.
3.  The technology platform utilized for the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is exclusively based on proprietary software developed by the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan uses ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps, the Digital Master Planning tool is developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics), not directly by ISRO.  ISRO's contribution is in providing crucial geospatial data.  Confusing the data provider with the tool developer is a common error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan explicitly includes data from various ministries, encompassing Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, and UDAN.  The omission of inland waterways is factually inaccurate.  This statement attempts to mislead by selectively omitting a key component.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India’s cloud).  This directly contradicts the claim of exclusive use of proprietary software.  The use of open-source technology is a crucial aspect of the plan's design, often overlooked by those unfamiliar with its technological underpinnings.  The statement plays on the potential misconception that government projects always use proprietary systems.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee is responsible for evaluating all PPP projects, both at the central and state levels.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over a period of five years.
3. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for the implementation of all PPP projects in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  State-level PPP projects fall under the purview of respective state-level committees. The statement attempts to create confusion by implying a centralized evaluation for all projects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  A seemingly small difference in timeframe can significantly affect the perception of the project's scale and ambition.  This minor alteration serves as an effective distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs, not the direct implementation of all projects.  Implementation is handled by various agencies and ministries at different levels.  The statement attempts to oversimplify the complex administrative structure of PPP implementation in India.


**3. With reference to India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP covers 24 crops, including all major Kharif and Rabi crops, but excludes commercial crops like jute and copra.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any involvement from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the only central procuring agency responsible for all MSP-related procurement across all crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MSP covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra). The inclusion of Toria and de-husked coconut is based on the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard, and copra, respectively. The statement incorrectly excludes commercial crops and adds to the total number of crops covered.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the CCEA chaired by the Prime Minister. The statement incorrectly attributes sole decision-making power to the CACP, ignoring the crucial role of the CCEA in the final approval.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the FCI is a major procuring agency for wheat and paddy, other agencies also participate in MSP procurement for various other crops.  The statement incorrectly suggests a monopoly of procurement by FCI.  This misconception is often held due to FCI's prominent role in procurement of major staple crops.



**4. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, aimed to achieve agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2023.
2. Agricultural exports in India have consistently increased year-on-year since the implementation of the 2018 policy.
3. The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was primarily due to unfavorable global market conditions and not domestic policy failures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target set by India’s Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was for agricultural exports to reach $60 billion by 2022, not 2023.  A slight alteration of the target year can significantly impact the assessment of policy success.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Agricultural exports in India registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, indicating a failure to maintain consistent growth. The statement presents a rosy picture that contradicts the available data.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While global market conditions play a role, the decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 is also attributed to domestic policy challenges and infrastructural bottlenecks.  The statement oversimplifies a complex issue by attributing the decline solely to external factors.  This is a common fallacy in analyzing economic performance.


**5. With reference to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP exclusively focuses on monetizing brownfield infrastructure assets in the energy sector.
2. The NMP aims to generate investment through the sale of government-owned assets, not through long-term lease or concession agreements.
3.  The target of ₹6.0 lakh crore under the NMP is spread across a period of five fiscal years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP identifies 13 sectors for monetization, not just the energy sector.  The statement severely limits the scope of the NMP to create a misleading impression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMP seeks to generate investment through various methods including long-term lease and concession agreements, not solely through outright sales.  The statement presents an overly simplistic view of the monetization strategies employed.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP’s target of ₹6.0 lakh crore is spread across four fiscal years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  The addition of one year alters the perceived pace and feasibility of the plan's objectives.


**6. With reference to Asset Monetization (AM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of Asset Monetization was first proposed by the Kelkar Committee in 2010.
2. Asset Monetization exclusively involves the outright sale of government assets to private entities.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was announced in the Union Budget 2020-21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijay Kelkar committee recommended AM for the first time in 2012, not 2010.  The two-year discrepancy is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  AM involves various methods for generating revenue, including licensing, leasing, and concession agreements, not just outright sales.  The statement oversimplifies the range of strategies used in asset monetization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP was announced in the Union Budget 2021-22, not 2020-21.  The one-year difference is significant and serves as a plausible distractor.


**7. With reference to the  Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF), consider the following statements:**

1. VGF provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant to enhance project viability.
2. VGF is exclusively available for projects in the renewable energy sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%, as a capital grant.  The 10% difference is a significant detail that can easily be overlooked.

Statement 2 is incorrect. VGF is not limited to the renewable energy sector; it can support various infrastructure projects.  The statement attempts to narrow the scope of VGF to mislead the candidate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Ministry of Finance plays a role, the specific administration of VGF can vary depending on the sector and project.  The statement oversimplifies the administrative structure of the scheme.


**8. With reference to Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), consider the following statements:**

1. DFCs aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 45% (2019) to 27% (2030).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. DFCs aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% (2019) to 45% (2030), not the other way around.  The reversal of percentages is a crucial detail that can easily confuse candidates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DFCCIL is a special purpose vehicle of Indian Railways, not a joint venture with private sector companies.  The statement attempts to create ambiguity regarding the ownership structure of DFCCIL.

Statement 3 is incorrect. DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act 1956, not 2013.  The difference in the year of incorporation is a vital detail.


**9. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1. RELOS is a bilateral agreement between India and the United States only.
2.  RELOS allows for the exchange of military logistics and support facilities between participating countries during wartime only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India has similar agreements with several countries including the US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea, not just the US.  The statement attempts to limit the scope of RELOS to a single country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RELOS facilitates logistics support during both wartime and peacetime missions.  The restriction to wartime only is a significant misrepresentation of the agreement's purpose.

Statement 3 is correct.  The agreement explicitly includes provisions for the replenishment of fuel, rations, spare parts, and berthing facilities.  This is a key feature of RELOS and is correctly stated.


**10. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Vadhvan Port, once completed, will be the 12th major port in India.
2.  The Sagarmala Programme primarily focuses on developing new ports and not on improving the efficiency of existing ports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vadhvan Port will be the 13th major port in India, not the 12th.  The one-port difference is a subtle but important factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sagarmala Programme aims to reduce logistics costs for foreign and domestic trade, optimize container movement, and enhance export competitiveness, which includes improving existing ports.  The statement falsely restricts the Sagarmala Programme's scope.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 aims to promote inland water transport and coastal shipping, not to reduce dependence on it. The statement contradicts the stated goals of the vision.


**11. With reference to the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), consider the following statements:**

**1. With reference to India's oilseed production, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh are the top three states contributing to India's total groundnut production.
2.  The National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) primarily focuses on improving post-harvest infrastructure.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) aims to ensure that oilseed farmers receive Minimum Support Price (MSP) through various schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu are significant contributors to groundnut production, Madhya Pradesh is not among the top three.  Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka collectively contribute 83.4% of the country's total groundnut production.  The question attempts to mislead by including a geographically plausible but factually incorrect state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NFSM-OS&OP focuses on seed components (breeding, distribution), production inputs, and technology transfer, not primarily on post-harvest infrastructure. This statement uses a related but inaccurate description of the scheme's activities to create confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. PM-AASHA indeed aims to ensure MSP for oilseed farmers through price support and price deficiency payment schemes.  This statement presents a straightforward and accurate description.


**2. With reference to the challenges and initiatives related to millet production in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's millet production has significantly increased in recent years, surpassing its Asian and global market share.
2.  The stagnation in millet production is primarily attributed to a lack of government support and research initiatives.
3.  Consumer preference shifts toward fine cereals and storage issues due to the relatively shorter shelf life of millets are contributing factors to stagnant production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a major producer of millets (accounting for nearly 80% of Asia’s and 20% of global production), the RBI's Annual Report highlights that the acreage and production of millets have stagnated over the years, contradicting the claim of significant increase.  The statement uses a factual element (India's significant share of global production) to create a misleading impression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While lack of government support might be a contributing factor, the text explicitly highlights other crucial factors such as yield gaps due to labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer, and shifts in consumer preferences.  The statement simplifies a complex issue by focusing on a single, insufficient cause.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the shift in consumer preferences towards fine cereals and the relatively shorter shelf life of millets, leading to storage problems as key reasons for stagnant production.  This statement accurately reflects the information provided.


**3. With reference to seaweed farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation is primarily carried out in inland water bodies like lakes and rivers.
2.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tonnes annually by 2025.
3.  The cultivation of seaweeds in the Andaman region is being spearheaded by the National Institute of Ocean Technology - Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI).

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seaweeds can thrive in various bodies of water, including rivers and lakes, the primary focus of seaweed farming in the given context is marine environments.  The statement focuses on a less significant aspect of seaweed cultivation to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana targets 1 million tonnes of seaweed production per year by 2025.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that offshore cultivation in the Andaman region has been initiated by NIOT-ACOSTI.  This statement accurately reflects the information provided.


**4. With reference to the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds (NMEO-Oilseeds), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMEO-Oilseeds aims to increase domestic edible oil production to meet 100% of India's projected domestic requirement by 2030-31.
2.  The mission focuses solely on increasing the production of key primary oilseed crops, neglecting secondary sources.
3.  The ‘Seed Authentication, Traceability & Holistic Inventory’ (SATHI) portal is a key feature of the scheme, facilitating timely seed availability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMEO-Oilseeds aims to meet around 72% of India's projected domestic requirement by 2030-31, not 100%.  The statement uses an inflated figure to create a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The mission's focus includes enhancing extraction efficiency from secondary sources like cottonseed, rice bran, and tree-borne oils, in addition to primary oilseed crops.  The statement omits a crucial aspect of the mission's strategy.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the SATHI portal as a key feature designed to ensure timely seed availability through online planning and coordination with seed-producing agencies.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information provided.


**5. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP covers all major agricultural crops produced in India, including all fruits and vegetables.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all crops.
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal central procuring agency for wheat and paddy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MSP covers a significant number of crops, it doesn't encompass all major agricultural produce, notably excluding fruits and vegetables.  The statement attempts to mislead by including a broad, but inaccurate, generalization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  This statement omits a crucial step in the MSP determination process.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that the FCI is the nodal agency for procuring wheat and paddy.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.


**6. With reference to India's agricultural export policy and its challenges, consider the following statements:**

1. India's agricultural exports have consistently exceeded the ambitious target set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.
2. Rice is the leading agricultural export from India, followed by marine products and spices.
3. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) is responsible for promoting exports and managing GI registrations for Indian agricultural products abroad.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the target set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018. The statement presents the opposite of the factual information.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage indicates that rice constitutes 21% of total exports, followed by marine products (15%) and spices (9%). This statement accurately reflects the provided data.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly describes APEDA's role in promoting exports and managing GI registrations for Indian products abroad. This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information provided.


**7. With reference to the Digital Agriculture Mission and its components, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agri Stack aims to create digital identities for farmers using Aadhaar as the primary identification method.
2. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) solely relies on data collected from field surveys and farmer inputs.
3. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform provides integrated data on farmers, farm locations, and crops sown.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Agri Stack aims to create digital identities for farmers, it does not explicitly mention Aadhaar as the sole identification method. The statement adds an unnecessary detail that is not confirmed by the passage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) integrates remote sensing data from sources like RISAT-1A and VEDAS, alongside other data sources, not solely relying on field surveys and farmer inputs. The statement limits the scope of the DSS's data sources.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly describes ADeX as a platform holding data on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.


**8. With reference to the horticulture sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India ranks first globally in the production of all types of fruits and vegetables.
2.  The Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) encompasses all aspects of horticulture, including post-harvest management and value chain development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India ranks second in fruits and vegetable production globally after China, and first in the production of Bananas, Mangoes, & Papayas, not all types of fruits and vegetables. The statement makes an overgeneralization.

Statement 2 is correct. MIDH covers various aspects of horticulture, implying a holistic approach that would include post-harvest management and value chain development, even if not explicitly mentioned.  The statement is a reasonable inference based on the scheme's objectives.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that CHAMAN uses remote sensing and GIS technologies for horticulture assessment and development. This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information provided.


**9. With reference to India's livestock sector and its challenges, consider the following statements:**

1.  India ranks first globally in terms of livestock population, exceeding all other countries.
2.  Low productivity in the Indian cattle sector is a major concern, compared to global averages.
3.  The government has not taken any significant steps to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance in livestock.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India has a large livestock population, it does not necessarily rank first globally.  The statement is a generalization that lacks specific supporting evidence.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the average annual productivity of cattle in India is lower than the world average. This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage mentions initiatives like the development of a unified genomic chip ('Gau Chip') to address issues in the livestock sector, implicitly indicating government efforts to address challenges, including antimicrobial resistance. The statement is directly contradicted by the provided information.


**10. With reference to the spice industry in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the world's largest producer and exporter of all types of spices.
2.  Chilli, cumin, turmeric, ginger, and coriander constitute a significant portion of India's total spice production.
3.  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana are the only states contributing to India's spice production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a leading producer and exporter of spices, it is not necessarily the largest producer and exporter of *all* types of spices. The statement makes an overgeneralization.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that chilli, cumin, turmeric, ginger, and coriander make up about 76% of India's total spice production. This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the listed states are major spice producers, others also contribute to India's spice production.  The statement is an exclusionary claim that is not supported by the provided information.  The passage mentions several states as major producers, implying that others also contribute.


**1. With reference to the regulation of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allows some UCBs to open new branches up to 15% of their existing number without prior approval, with a maximum of 8 new branches annually.
2.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
3. The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri M.N. Rajan in 2008.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The RBI does allow some UCBs to expand their branch network without prior approval, but the limit is capped at 10% of the existing number of branches in the previous financial year, with a maximum of 5 new branches.  The question manipulates the percentage and maximum number to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds and have a customer interface, unlike Type I. This distinction is crucial in understanding the regulatory framework for UCBs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the need for an umbrella organization was highlighted by multiple RBI working groups, the question incorrectly attributes it to Shri M.N. Rajan in 2008.  The text mentions Shri N.S. Viswanathan's working group in 2006 and Shri V.S. Das's group in 2009 as recommending models for such an organization. This alteration of names and dates makes it a challenging distractor.  The precise details of these committees and their reports are key knowledge points for the UPSC examination.


**2. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will come into effect from January 1, 2025.
2. The framework applies to all UCBs irrespective of their tier categorization.
3. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the primary parameters for monitoring under the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date of the new PCA framework is April 1, 2025, not January 1, 2025.  This subtle change in the date is designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework specifically excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The question omits this crucial exception, making it a strong distractor.  Understanding the nuances of regulatory exemptions is important for a complete understanding of the financial sector.

Statement 3 is correct. Capital, asset quality, and profitability (CAP) are indeed the key areas monitored under the PCA framework for UCBs. This is a straightforward statement, but its correctness is crucial in the context of the incorrect statements.  The ability to identify and evaluate the accuracy of individual statements within a larger context is a key skill tested in the UPSC examination.


**3. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) are categorized into Shishu, Kishore, Tarun, and Yuva categories.
2. The RBI's Malegam Committee, established in 2012, recommended a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs.
3. The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Bank, established in 1972, is recognized as India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PMMY loans are categorized into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, not four categories. The addition of "Yuva" is a deliberate attempt to mislead candidates familiar with the scheme.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Malegam Committee was established in 2010, not 2012.  This seemingly minor error is designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the timeline of regulatory developments in the microfinance sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect. SEWA Bank was established in 1974, not 1972.  The alteration of the establishment year is a subtle but effective distractor.  Remembering precise dates related to key institutions and events is vital for success in the UPSC examination.  The question's structure forces candidates to thoroughly evaluate each statement.


**4. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. NBFCs are permitted to accept demand deposits from the public.
2. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures deposits in NBFCs up to ₹10 lakh.
3. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A defining characteristic of NBFCs is their inability to accept demand deposits; this is a key distinction between NBFCs and banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DICGC insurance coverage for bank deposits is capped at ₹5 lakh, not ₹10 lakh. The question increases this amount to create confusion.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating NBFCs, the regulation of Housing Finance Companies falls under the purview of the National Housing Bank (NHB). The question incorrectly assigns this responsibility to the RBI.  The answer choice (d) is correct because all three statements contain inaccuracies concerning key aspects of NBFC regulation.  This highlights the importance of comprehensive knowledge of the regulatory landscape.


**5. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is published bi-annually by the RBI.
2. The FI-Index incorporates data from the banking, investment, and insurance sectors, but excludes the postal and pension sectors.
3. Access, usage, and quality are the three broad parameters used in calculating the FI-Index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published annually, not bi-annually. The change in the frequency of publication is a subtle error designed to test the candidate's precise recall of details.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index explicitly includes data from the postal and pension sectors, in addition to banking, investment, and insurance. This omission is a significant inaccuracy designed as a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The three broad parameters used are indeed Access, Usage, and Quality.  This statement serves as a contrast to the incorrect statements, making the question more challenging and requiring careful evaluation of each point.



**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS was launched in 2022.
2. The scheme covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), regardless of their asset size.
3. The scheme aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022.  This minor alteration in the launch year is a common technique used to test precise recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RB-IOS covers NBFCs with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above, excluding Housing Finance Companies.  The question removes this important condition, leading to a misleading statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's primary objective is indeed to provide a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer complaints. This correct statement contrasts with the two incorrect ones, demanding careful evaluation by the candidate.


**7. With reference to Small Finance Banks (SFBs) transitioning into Universal Banks, consider the following statements:**

1. SFBs must maintain a minimum net worth of Rs. 500 crore to be eligible for transition.
2.  SFBs must have a satisfactory track record of performance for a minimum of 3 years.
3.  The transition process permits the addition of new promoters or changes to existing promoters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum net worth required for SFBs to transition into universal banks is Rs. 1000 crore, not Rs. 500 crore.  This numerical change is a common way to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SFBs must have a satisfactory track record for at least 5 years, not 3 years.  The alteration of the minimum years of operation is a subtle but effective distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The transition process explicitly prohibits the addition of new promoters or changes to existing promoters. The question reverses this crucial condition, making it a strong distractor.  The correct answer is (d) because all three statements contain inaccuracies.  Thorough knowledge of the eligibility criteria is essential.


**8. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks are applicable only to Urban Cooperative Banks.
2.  Under the revised norms, provisions for bad and doubtful debt reserves must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account.
3.  Cooperative banks can allocate net profits to the Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) before complying with IRACP norms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised NPA provisioning norms apply to Urban, State, and Central Cooperative Banks. The question restricts the applicability to only Urban Cooperative Banks, creating a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is correct.  Provisions for bad and doubtful debt reserves must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account.  This is a straightforward statement, serving as a contrast to the incorrect ones.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Cooperative banks must comply with IRACP norms *before* allocating net profits to BDDR. The question reverses this order, making it a strong distractor.  The correct answer is (b) because only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  This highlights the importance of understanding the sequence of accounting procedures.


**9. With reference to Co-lending in the Indian financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1. In a co-lending arrangement, the maximum credit risk borne by the NBFC is 15%.
2. Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.
3. Co-lending primarily aims to increase lending capacity and reduce risk for individual lenders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum credit risk borne by the NBFC in a co-lending arrangement is 20%, not 15%.  This numerical error is a common distractor technique.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Banks are specifically prohibited from entering into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.  This crucial restriction is reversed in the statement to create confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. Co-lending indeed aims to increase lending capacity and mitigate risk for individual lenders.  This correct statement stands in contrast to the incorrect ones, demanding careful evaluation by the candidate.


**10. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.
2.  The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2012.
3.  The BIS's Hallmark certification guarantees the purity of precious metal articles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is mandatory only for specific products, not all products sold in India.  This generalisation creates a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2016, not 2012. This alteration of the year of establishment is a common distractor technique.

Statement 3 is correct. The BIS's Hallmark certification does indeed guarantee the purity of precious metal articles.  This correct statement contrasts with the two incorrect ones, demanding critical evaluation by the candidate.  The correct answer is (b) because only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  This question tests knowledge of specific details related to product standardization.


**1. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  Key monitoring areas under the PCA framework include the UCBs' capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability, with breaches in risk thresholds leading to the imposition of PCA.
3. Exit from PCA involves maintaining adherence to risk thresholds across all parameters for four consecutive quarterly financial statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the key features of the revised PCA framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) as described in the provided text.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the effective date, the replacement of the SAF, and the exception for UCBs under AID. Statement 2 accurately points out the core monitoring areas—capital, asset quality, and profitability—and the consequence of breaching risk thresholds. Statement 3 correctly outlines the conditions for exiting the PCA framework: consistent adherence to risk thresholds over four consecutive quarters.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals or groups from low-income households (annual income up to ₹3,00,000).
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) offers loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with the 2024 Union Budget expanding the Tarun category limit to ₹20 lakh ("Tarun Plus").
3. The Malegam Committee, established in 2010, recommended a regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) involved in microfinance, with the RBI acting as the primary regulatory body for MFIs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of facts related to microfinance in India. Statement 1 correctly reflects the RBI's definition of microfinance loans, specifying the income limit and collateral requirement. Statement 2 accurately describes the PMMY scheme, its loan categories, and the recent budget expansion of the Tarun category. Statement 3 correctly mentions the Malegam Committee's recommendations and the RBI's role in regulating microfinance institutions.  The information presented in each statement aligns precisely with the details provided in the source material.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC, registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), aims to raise capital (targeting ₹300 crore) and provide fund management and consultancy services to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  As a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), NUCFDC assists UCBs in complying with the Banking Regulation Act (BRA), 1949, and facilitates communication with regulators.
3.  The establishment of an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector, like NUCFDC, was first proposed by an RBI working group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2009, building upon a 2006 working group led by Shri V.S. Das.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the functions and role of NUCFDC.  Statement 1 correctly identifies NUCFDC's registration as a Type II NBFC-ND and its objectives regarding capital raising and providing services to UCBs. Statement 2 correctly points to NUCFDC's role as an SRO, assisting with regulatory compliance and communication. However, Statement 3 contains an error in the chronology. While the need for an umbrella organization was highlighted by the Viswanathan committee in 2006, the model was recommended by the Das committee in 2009, not the other way around.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding initiatives related to India's livestock sector:**

1. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying has developed a Unified Genomic Chip, including the ‘Gau Chip’ for cattle and the ‘Mahish Chip’ for buffaloes, to enhance livestock management and breeding.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the MSP covers 22 crops: 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops, along with Toria and de-husked coconut.  The statement inflates the number of covered crops and the number of Kharif crops.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends the MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. This indicates a multi-stage process involving both expert recommendation and political decision-making. The statement ignores the crucial role of the CCEA.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that the FCI is the nodal agency for wheat and paddy procurement.  It does not imply FCI's sole responsibility for all MSP-covered crops.  Other agencies and mechanisms are likely involved in the procurement process for other crops. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate picture of the procurement system.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS), not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  They are not directly regulated by the RBI.  This is a crucial distinction highlighting the different regulatory frameworks governing cooperative societies versus commercial banks. The oversight and regulatory mechanisms differ significantly, impacting their operational aspects and financial supervision.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs play a vital role in the three-tier cooperative credit structure by providing funds to PACS.  NABARD, the apex institution for rural credit, further refines DCCBs and SCBs, ensuring a continuous flow of credit to the grassroots level.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The NTM actively promotes the adoption of technical textiles across diverse sectors.  One of its key strategies involves mandating the use of technical textiles by various central ministries and departments. This pushes the adoption and growth of the industry.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NTM aims to position India as a global leader in technical textiles, the timeframe is not specified as within five years. The mission has long-term goals, and achieving a leading global position would likely take more time.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PLI scheme for textiles is directly relevant to the NTM's objectives.  The PLI scheme is a key component in boosting the production and competitiveness of the Indian textile industry, including technical textiles.  Both aim to enhance India's position in the global market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of "green shoots" in economics is accurately described. They represent initial positive indicators of economic recovery after a downturn.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's assessment highlights the rural sector's significant contribution to the FMCG sector's growth, indicating that rural consumption is a key driver.  It's not a secondary factor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While agricultural production and income are factors, the RBI's assessment of the rural economy's role in FMCG growth likely considers a broader range of data, including rural consumption patterns and spending habits.  It's not solely based on agricultural data.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 2 nor 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's regulations apply to NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above that accept deposits or have a customer interface. Not all NBFCs fall under this category.

Statement 2 is correct.  Housing Finance Companies are specifically excluded from the RBI's regulatory ambit concerning NBFCs accepting deposits.  This reflects a nuanced regulatory approach based on the specific nature of these financial institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI may appoint Ombudsmen for a maximum tenure of three years at a time, not exceeding five years. This limitation is designed to ensure regular review and accountability within the regulatory framework.  The maximum tenure of three years reflects a balance between continuity and the need for fresh perspectives.


**2. With reference to Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) in India's financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure financial viability and independence.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SROs are required to be *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. This structure emphasizes their focus on sectorial development and regulation rather than profit maximization. The not-for-profit structure is crucial for maintaining impartiality and focusing on the collective good.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While representing the collective voice of members is an objective of SROs, it is not the *primary* objective.  Other crucial functions include promoting compliance culture, supporting smaller entities, collecting sectoral information, and encouraging R&D.  These diverse objectives contribute to a robust and well-regulated sector.

Statement 3 is correct. The governance framework of an SRO mandates that at least one-third of its Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent.  This requirement ensures objectivity and prevents conflicts of interest within the SRO's operations. The presence of independent directors enhances transparency and accountability.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, of acquisition of financial assets. This timeframe is crucial for understanding the long-term commitment involved in resolving stressed assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Narasimham Committee II (1998), not Committee I (1991), proposed the establishment of ARCs in India, drawing parallels with asset management companies globally.  Understanding the specific committee and its recommendations is vital for comprehending the policy context.

Statement 3 is correct. ARCs are prohibited from raising money by way of deposits. This restriction is designed to safeguard depositors and maintain the stability of the financial system.  This restriction distinguishes ARCs from other financial institutions that can access funds through deposits.


**6. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All seven CRAs registered with SEBI are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2.  SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy, but not guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest.
3.  Credit bureaus and CRAs perform identical functions, assessing both past and future debt repayment abilities of borrowers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Only six CRAs (excluding Brickwork Ratings) are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.  This distinction is important for understanding the scope of their regulatory oversight and the different functions they perform.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, *and* guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest.  Transparency in these aspects is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of credit ratings.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Credit bureaus and CRAs perform distinct functions. Credit bureaus provide information on past debt repayments, while CRAs provide forward-looking opinions on the ability of entities to meet their financial commitments.  Understanding this difference is key to understanding the role each plays in the financial ecosystem.

The new SEBI norms allow for the issuance of subordinate units by *privately* placed InvITs, not publicly placed ones, to sponsors on the acquisition of an infrastructure project. This distinction is crucial for understanding the regulatory environment for different types of InvITs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. InvITs earn income through various streams, including tolls, rents, interest, and dividends from their investments.  This diversification of income streams contributes to the financial stability and resilience of InvITs.  The diversity of income streams reduces the risk associated with any single type of investment.


**8. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  GST is a comprehensive direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services.
2.  The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279B of the Constitution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are the grassroot-level arms of the *short-term*, not long-term, cooperative credit structure.  The distinction between short-term and long-term credit is crucial for understanding their role in agricultural finance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  They are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS).  This regulatory distinction is vital for understanding their operational framework.

Statement 3 is correct. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a significant role in providing funds to PACS.  This inter-linkage is crucial for the functioning of the cooperative credit system.  This flow of funds from DCCBs to PACS is a vital aspect of rural credit delivery.


**1. With reference to offshore mineral resources in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) encompasses over two million square kilometers, holding significant recoverable offshore mineral resources, including gold and diamonds.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMMSY targets 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, not 500,000 tons. This demonstrates a significant ambition for seaweed cultivation under the scheme's goals.

Statement 2 is correct. PMMSY actively promotes the adoption of sustainable and efficient aquaculture techniques, including RAS and Biofloc, to improve productivity and reduce environmental impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  PMMSY is an umbrella scheme that addresses gaps across the entire fisheries sector, encompassing both marine and inland fisheries.  The scheme aims for holistic development in both areas, not just marine environments.



**4. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism covers 24 major crops, including all major Kharif and Rabi crops.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.
3.  Agricultural exports in India consistently exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP mechanism covers 22 crops, not 24.  While it includes the majority of major Kharif and Rabi crops, the exact number is 22.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Agricultural exports in 2023-24 fell short of the $60 billion target set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, registering a decline instead of exceeding the target.



**5. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agreement on Agriculture mandates the elimination of all export subsidies by both developed and developing countries.
2.  The "peace clause" adopted at the WTO's 9th Ministerial Conference provides a permanent solution to the public stockholding (PSH) issue.
3.  Tariffication, a key aspect of market access under the Agreement, involves converting all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Agreement on Agriculture aims to reduce trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies, it doesn't mandate the complete elimination of export subsidies by all countries.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 made progress in this area, but complete elimination is not universally achieved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "peace clause" is an interim solution, providing temporary protection for countries' public stockholding programs, not a permanent resolution.  It is a temporary measure to address concerns.

Statement 3 is correct. Tariffication is a core element of the market access pillar of the Agreement on Agriculture.  It requires the conversion of non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and variable levies, into equivalent tariffs, promoting transparency and predictability in trade.


**6. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and related indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.
2.  The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the loss in HDI due to inequality, but does not consider planetary pressures.
3.  The Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index adjusts the HDI to account for intergenerational inequality but not for gender inequality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GII accurately captures gender disparities across reproductive health, empowerment (including educational attainment and political representation), and economic participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IHDI does indeed account for inequality's impact on the HDI, reducing the HDI value to reflect the loss due to inequality.  However, it does *not* directly incorporate planetary pressures, which is addressed by a separate index.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Planetary pressures-adjusted HDI accounts for environmental sustainability concerns, representing a shift towards considering intergenerational equity.  It does not exclusively focus on intergenerational inequality but also incorporates environmental sustainability.  The GDI addresses gender inequality separately.


**7. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 MPI report indicates that less than 1 billion people globally live in acute multidimensional poverty.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the *sole* agency for all MSP-covered crops. Other agencies also participate in procurement, making the statement factually inaccurate and a strong distractor.


**4.  With reference to the Livestock Sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The average annual productivity of cattle in India exceeds the world average.
2.  The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to improve the productivity of crossbred bovine breeds.
3. The Unified Genomic Chip ('Gau Chip') is solely for cattle, excluding buffaloes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The average annual productivity of cattle in India is lower than the world average. This directly contradicts the given information, serving as a clear distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses on indigenous, not crossbred, bovine breeds.  The substitution of breed type is a key element designed to mislead.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  A separate 'Mahish Chip' exists for buffaloes, in addition to the 'Gau Chip' for cattle.  The omission of the buffalo chip is a significant detail that tests thorough knowledge.


**5. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹8 lakh crore over four years.
3. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects, not solely state-level projects.  This distinction in the level of government is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹8 lakh crore, over four years (FY22 to FY25).  The inaccurate target amount is a significant numerical distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The VGF provides up to 40%, not 50%, of project costs as a capital grant.  This minor but crucial numerical difference is designed to test precise knowledge.


**1. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) aims to reduce logistics costs by improving infrastructure quality.
2. The Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) integrates various logistics stakeholders, but excludes the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
3. The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index ranks states based on their performance in providing ease of doing business in the logistics sector, with higher ranking indicating better performance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. LEEP is designed to enhance the efficiency of freight transport, which directly contributes to reducing logistics costs.  Improving infrastructure is a key component of this efficiency enhancement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the exact scope of ULIP isn't explicitly detailed in the provided text, the overall aim of improving logistics efficiency suggests that it would aim for inclusivity, including SMEs, to comprehensively improve the sector. Excluding SMEs would contradict the goal of improving the overall logistics ecosystem.

Statement 3 is correct. The LEADS Index is explicitly mentioned as a tool for ranking states based on their performance in facilitating ease of doing business in logistics.  A higher ranking directly reflects better performance in streamlining logistics operations.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to India's Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) was established in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act of 1956, with the primary objective of developing and maintaining the DFC network.
2.  DFCs are intended to increase the share of rail freight traffic from its 2019 level of 27% to 45% by 2030, primarily by reducing transit times and improving efficiency.
3. The National Rail Plan 2030 is independent of the DFC project and does not incorporate DFC's projected increase in rail freight traffic into its overall targets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act of 1956 to plan, develop, and operate the DFCs.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that DFCs aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% (2019) to 45% (2030). This increase is directly linked to the improved efficiency and reduced transit times provided by DFCs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that DFCs are designed to *assist* the National Rail Plan 2030 in achieving its freight traffic targets. This implies that the National Rail Plan 2030 is aware of and incorporates the projected increase in rail freight traffic due to DFCs.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sagarmala Programme, launched in 2015, aims to increase the number of major ports in India, focusing on expanding port infrastructure along the coastline.
2. The Mormugao Port Authority introduced the Harit Shrey scheme in 2023, incentivizing ships with favorable Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores to promote sustainable shipping practices.
3.  Vadhavan Port, once operational, will be India's largest container port and is being developed based on the 'landlord port model,' where the port authority retains operational control while private entities manage specific aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sagarmala aims to reduce logistics costs and optimize container movement, its primary focus isn't on increasing the *number* of major ports. The program focuses on optimizing existing infrastructure and improving efficiency, not necessarily expansion of the number of major ports.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Mormugao Port introducing the Harit Shrey scheme in 2023 to incentivize greener shipping practices using the ESI.

Statement 3 is correct. The description of Vadhvan Port clearly states that it will be India's largest container port and that it will be developed using the landlord port model, where private players handle operational aspects under the port authority's regulatory oversight.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID was established under the Companies Act, 2013, and is classified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) because its paid-up share capital is held by the central government.
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to provide short-term, high-interest loans to infrastructure projects to ensure rapid project completion.
3.  To be classified as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013, an institution must be established under a Central or State Act, or at least 51% of its paid-up share capital must be held by the central or state government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NaBFID was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not the Companies Act, 2013. While it is a PFI, the text doesn't specify the exact percentage of government shareholding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term* infrastructure financing, not short-term loans.  The focus is on sustainable and long-term development, not rapid completion at any cost.

Statement 3 is correct.  The definition of a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013, is accurately described in this statement.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**5. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is announced at the beginning of the harvesting season to ensure farmers receive a fair price for their produce.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
3. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform includes data on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown, but excludes data on soil health and irrigation methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MSP is announced at the beginning of the *sowing* season, not the harvesting season, to allow farmers to plan their cultivation accordingly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The final decision on MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

Statement 3 is correct. ADeX includes data on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown, as stated in the provided text.  The text does not mention whether soil health and irrigation data are included.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF):**

1.  From independence until economic liberalization, GFCF remained consistently below 10% of GDP.
2.  GFCF reached its peak as a percentage of GDP around 2007-08, exceeding 27%.
3.  Private investment, a major component of GFCF, experienced a continuous decline from 2011-12, reaching a low of 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21 before showing signs of recovery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF fluctuated around 10% of GDP in the pre-liberalization era, it wasn't consistently below that mark.  There were periods where it exceeded 10%.  The statement oversimplifies a complex historical trend.

Statement 2 is correct. GFCF did reach a high point of approximately 27% of GDP around 2007-08, reflecting a period of robust economic growth and investment. This represents a significant increase from earlier decades.

Statement 3 is also correct.  Private investment, a crucial driver of GFCF, experienced a substantial downturn starting in 2011-12. This decline culminated in a low of 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21, coinciding with various economic challenges.  The subsequent recovery is a recent development, not fully established at the time of the statement's creation.  The statement accurately captures this significant trend.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of India's investment trends and the ability to discern factual accuracy from a potentially misleading simplification.


**2. With reference to the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NICDP aims to develop futuristic industrial cities capable of competing with global manufacturing hubs by 2030.
2.  The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, the first project under NICDP, was approved in 2007, and its implementation is overseen by the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) and the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (NICDC).
3.  The Union Cabinet's recent approval of twelve new industrial nodes/cities under the NICDP involves projects strategically located across 15 states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because it adds a specific timeframe (by 2030) not explicitly stated in the provided text regarding the NICDP's long-term aim.  The goal is to create globally competitive industrial cities, but the text doesn't specify a completion date.

Statement 2 is correct. The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor was indeed the first project, approved in 2007. The NICDIT and NICDC are the implementing bodies as mentioned in the source material.

Statement 3 is incorrect because it alters the number of states involved. The provided text clearly states that the 12 new nodes are spread across 10 states, not 15. This is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's attention to factual accuracy.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. The question tests the candidate's ability to identify precise details and avoid being misled by plausible but incorrect additions or alterations of information.


**3. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) provides assistance to countries experiencing serious balance-of-payments issues primarily due to short-term economic shocks.
2. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) offers concessional financing, currently at zero interest rates, tailored to the diverse needs of low-income countries.
3. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) exclusively provides funding for infrastructure projects in fragile states to enhance long-term economic resilience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the EFF does address balance-of-payments problems, it focuses more on structural impediments and slow growth, not just short-term shocks.  The statement misrepresents the core issue addressed by the EFF.

Statement 2 is correct. The PRGT does provide concessional financing, currently at zero interest rates, specifically designed for the needs of low-income countries. This accurately reflects the fund's purpose and terms.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The RST does aim to build resilience, but it doesn't exclusively fund infrastructure projects or limit itself to fragile states.  The statement presents an overly narrow and inaccurate description of the RST's scope.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The question challenges the candidate's understanding of IMF lending instruments and their specific purposes, testing their ability to differentiate between accurate and misleading descriptions.


**4. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. Launched in 2024, the WBG-GP aims to increase the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $30 billion by 2030.
2. The WBG-GP consolidates all guarantee products and expertise from across World Bank Group institutions under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
3. The World Bank's guarantees primarily focus on providing credit guarantees for loans to the public sector, excluding private sector projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target for annual guarantee issuance set by the WBG-GP is $20 billion, not $30 billion, by 2030.  This is a significant numerical difference that tests the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The WBG-GP does consolidate guarantee products and expertise under MIGA, as stated in the source material.  This accurately reflects the platform's function.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  World Bank guarantees cover both public and private sector projects, including public-private partnerships.  The statement falsely restricts the scope of the guarantees provided.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical data and understand the comprehensive nature of the World Bank's guarantee programs.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS:**

1. The Inclusive Framework, established in 2015, comprises over 150 countries and jurisdictions committed to combating tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs).
2. Pillar One of the Two-pillar solution focuses on reallocating a portion of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs to countries where their consumers are located.
3.  The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, signed by India in 2018, aims to update international tax rules and reduce tax avoidance opportunities for MNEs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Inclusive Framework was established in 2016, not 2015, and the number of participating countries and jurisdictions is 147 (as specified in the text), not over 150.  This tests the candidate's ability to recall precise details.

Statement 2 is correct. Pillar One of the Two-pillar solution accurately described in the text focuses on the reallocation of profits of large MNEs to consumer markets.

Statement 3 is incorrect because it changes the year of India signing the convention.  India signed the convention in 2017, not 2018.  This again tests attention to specific dates.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details and dates related to international tax cooperation initiatives.


**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership focused solely on poverty reduction in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
2. The EIF's Trust Fund Manager is the World Bank, reflecting its significant financial contribution.
3.  The World Trade Organization (WTO) is one of the international organizations supporting the EIF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The EIF is a multilateral partnership, not bilateral, dedicated to assisting LDCs in utilizing trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while poverty reduction is a key goal, it's not the sole focus. The EIF's Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the World Bank, although the World Bank is a supporting organization. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. Statement 3 is correct as the WTO is among the international organizations supporting the EIF's objectives.  The involvement of multiple international organizations highlights the collaborative nature of the EIF's approach to promoting trade-led development in LDCs.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. DBN was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas.
2. The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) was a lapsable fund, meaning unspent funds reverted to the government each year.
3. DBN replaced the USOF, which generated funds through a levy on licensees based on their Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, not the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The USOF was a non-lapsable fund; unspent amounts carried over to subsequent years. Statement 2 is incorrect because of this. Statement 3 is correct; DBN replaced the USOF, which indeed generated funds through a 5% levy on the AGR of DoT licensees.  The shift from USOF to DBN signifies a change in the approach to funding telecom infrastructure development in India.


**3. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating instant cross-border payments.
2. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS) that could be integrated into Project Nexus.
3. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is headquartered in London, England.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative, involving several countries, not just India and Singapore.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  UPI is indeed an example of an IPS, and its integration into Project Nexus is a key aspect of the project's design. Statement 2 is correct.  The BIS is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, not London. Statement 3 is incorrect. Project Nexus's aim to connect diverse IPS highlights the growing importance of interoperability in international finance.


**4. With reference to Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FVCIs are investors incorporated in India, registered under SEBI regulations, and investing in Indian companies.
2. FVCIs can invest directly in unlisted Indian companies or through SEBI-registered venture capital funds.
3. Venture capital funds (VCFs) primarily invest in low-risk, low-return ventures to ensure stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

FVCIs are incorporated *outside* India, not within India.  Statement 1 is incorrect on this key point.  Statement 2 is correct; FVCIs can invest either directly in unlisted companies or indirectly through VCFs.  VCFs invest in high-risk, high-return ventures, not low-risk, low-return ventures as stated in statement 3, which is therefore incorrect. The SEBI regulations governing FVCIs aim to attract foreign investment while protecting the domestic market.


**5. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GII 2024 was released by the World Bank, Cornell University, and INSEAD Business School.
2.  India ranked among the top 10 nations in the GII 2024.
3. The GII 2024's theme was focused on the potential of social entrepreneurship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GII 2024 was released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Cornell University, and INSEAD Business School, not the World Bank. Statement 1 is thus incorrect. India ranked 39th, not among the top 10, in the GII 2024. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GII 2024 did indeed focus on the promise of social entrepreneurship. Statement 3 is correct.  The GII ranking provides insights into a nation's innovation ecosystem and its capacity for technological advancement.


**6. With reference to the Bretton Woods Conference and its outcomes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bretton Woods Conference led to the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
2. The conference established a fixed exchange rate system where currencies were pegged to gold or the US dollar.
3. The conference aimed to promote free trade to foster international prosperity and peace.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bretton Woods Conference established the IMF and the IBRD (World Bank), not the WTO. The WTO was created much later.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The conference did establish a fixed exchange rate system based on gold or the US dollar, although this system eventually collapsed. Statement 2 is correct.  Promoting free trade for international prosperity and peace was indeed a central goal of the conference. Statement 3 is also correct. The Bretton Woods system significantly shaped the post-World War II global economic order.


**7. With reference to IMF lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional loans at zero interest rates to low-income countries.
2. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) offers concessional financing tailored to the needs of low-income countries.
3. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) provides short-term financing to middle-income countries facing economic crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GRA provides loans on non-concessional terms (market-based interest rates), not concessional loans at zero interest rates. Statement 1 is incorrect. The PRGT does offer concessional financial support, currently at zero interest rates, specifically designed for low-income countries. Statement 2 is correct. The RST offers *longer-term*, not short-term, financing to build resilience, not just address immediate crises. Statement 3 is therefore incorrect.  The IMF's diverse lending instruments reflect its role in supporting global economic stability.


**8. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP was launched in 2023 to consolidate guarantee products and expertise across World Bank institutions.
2. The WBG-GP aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $10 billion by 2030.
3. The WBG provides political risk insurance only for public sector projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The WBG-GP was launched in 2024, not 2023. Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP aims to *increase*, not reduce, the annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The WBG provides political risk insurance for both private and public sector projects, including public-private partnerships. Statement 3 is incorrect. The platform's goal to increase guarantee issuance reflects the World Bank's commitment to supporting infrastructure development globally.


**9. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1. TRIPS sets minimum standards of protection for intellectual property rights, incorporating elements from WIPO's Paris Convention but not the Berne Convention.
2. TRIPS explicitly prohibits compulsory licensing for patented products or processes.
3. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement clarifies that TRIPS does not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

TRIPS incorporates provisions from both the Paris and Berne Conventions. Statement 1 is incorrect. TRIPS *does allow* compulsory licensing, recognizing the needs of developing countries.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Doha Declaration affirms that TRIPS should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health, specifically allowing flexibility for this purpose. Statement 3 is correct.  TRIPS's provisions and subsequent interpretations reflect the complex balancing act between intellectual property rights and public policy goals.


**10. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. From independence until economic liberalization, GFCF as a percentage of GDP consistently remained below 5%.
2. GFCF reached its peak as a percentage of GDP around 2007-08.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

From independence to liberalization, GFCF fluctuated around 10% of GDP, not consistently below 5%. Statement 1 is incorrect. GFCF did reach a peak of around 27% of GDP in 2007-08. Statement 2 is correct. Private investment, as a percentage of GDP, declined after 2011-12, hitting a low in 2020-21 before starting to rise again. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Fluctuations in GFCF reflect the dynamics of investment in the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term*, non-recourse financing, not short-term, recourse-based financing. Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. Statement 2 is incorrect. Statement 3 is correct; the Government of India holds all of NaBFID's shares. NaBFID's role in long-term infrastructure finance is crucial for India's development.


**12. With reference to India's e-commerce market, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's e-commerce market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2030, according to Invest India.
2. 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted under the automatic route for inventory-based e-commerce models in India.
3. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create a closed, proprietary e-commerce network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Invest India projects the e-commerce market to reach $325 billion by 2030, not $400 billion. Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted under the automatic route for inventory-based e-commerce models to protect the domestic retail sector. Statement 2 is incorrect. ONDC aims to create an *open source*, not closed and proprietary, e-commerce network to promote competition and inclusivity. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The growth of India's e-commerce sector is influenced by regulatory policies and technological innovations.




**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership primarily focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade for sustainable development.
2. The UNOPS serves as the EIF Trust Fund Manager, and the World Bank and WTO are among its key supporting organizations.
3.  The EIF currently involves 25 partner countries, with a focus on African nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the EIF is a *multilateral* partnership, not bilateral.  It involves a broader range of partners beyond just two entities. Its core objective is to help LDCs leverage trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction, which is accurately reflected.

Statement 2 is correct. The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) indeed manages the EIF Trust Fund, and the World Bank and WTO provide crucial support to its operations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The number of partner countries in the EIF is significantly higher than 25; the text mentions 51 partner countries.  The focus is not solely on African nations, although African LDCs are a significant portion of its beneficiaries.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN was established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas at subsidized prices, replacing the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
2. The USOF was a non-lapsable fund generated through a Universal Access Levy, calculated as 10% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.
3.  The DBN's administrative control and financial oversight are under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DBN, created under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, aims to finance telecom projects in underserved regions at affordable rates, effectively succeeding the USOF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the USOF was a non-lapsable fund generated by a Universal Access Levy, the levy was 5%, not 10%, of the Adjusted Gross Revenue of DoT licensees.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The administrative control and financial oversight of the DBN fall under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), not the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE-AVGC-XR is structured as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2012, and is temporarily named the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).
2. Its establishment was proposed in the 2021-22 Union Budget, with the aim of boosting the AVGC sector's contribution to the Indian economy.
3.  The NCoE-AVGC-XR is primarily funded through a dedicated grant from the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The NCoE for AVGC-XR is indeed set up as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013 (not 2012), and its provisional name is the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The proposal for the NCoE-AVGC-XR came from the 2022-23 Union Budget, not 2021-22.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The source of funding for the NCoE-AVGC-XR isn't specified in the provided text. While government funding is likely, the statement about a dedicated grant from the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is not supported by the provided information.


**4. With reference to Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The new PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2024, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  The key monitoring parameters under the PCA framework include Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Non-Performing Asset (NPA) ratio, and Return on Assets (ROA).
3.  UCBs exiting the PCA framework require a consistent improvement in risk parameters over six consecutive quarterly financial statements.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The new PCA framework for UCBs replaces the SAF and applies to Tier 2, 3, and 4 UCBs (excluding those under AID), but its effective date is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.

Statement 2 is correct.  Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are the key areas for monitoring under the PCA framework.  While CAR, NPA ratio, and ROA are components of these, the statement accurately reflects the broad monitoring approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The exit from PCA requires the absence of breaches in risk thresholds for four, not six, consecutive quarterly financial statements.


**5. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NUCFDC is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  Its primary functions include providing liquidity and capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), ensuring regulatory compliance, and developing a shared technology platform.
3.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first identified by an RBI working group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2009.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs interact directly with the public and accept public funds.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NUCFDC's key functions accurately reflect its role in supporting UCBs through liquidity, regulatory guidance, and technological infrastructure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the need for an umbrella organization was highlighted by an RBI working group, it was the Viswanathan committee in 2006 that first raised the issue, with the Das committee in 2009 offering a refined model.


**6. With reference to Nidhi Companies, consider the following statements:**

1. Nidhi companies are declared by the Central Government under the Companies Act, 2013, and must adhere to the Nidhi Rules, 2014.
2.  Their primary objective is to encourage thrift and savings among their members by accepting deposits from and lending only to their members.
3.  To be declared a Nidhi company, an entity must have a minimum of five hundred members and net owned funds of at least twenty lakh rupees.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nidhi companies are indeed declared under the Companies Act, 2013, and governed by the Nidhi Rules, 2014.

Statement 2 is also correct. Their core purpose is to promote savings and lending within their membership, fostering a cooperative financial environment.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The minimum number of members required for a Nidhi company is two hundred, not five hundred, and the minimum net owned funds are ten lakh rupees, not twenty lakh rupees.


**7. With reference to the World Gold Council (WGC), consider the following statements:**

1. The WGC was established in 1987 by a group of central banks to regulate the global gold market.
2.  In 2022, India was the world's leading importer of gold, exceeding Switzerland and China in volume.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WGC was formed in 1987 by mining companies, not central banks. Its role is not primarily regulation but rather market analysis and promotion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India is a significant importer of gold, in 2022, Switzerland and China were ahead of India in terms of gold import volume.

Statement 3 is correct.  The WGC's core function is indeed research and analysis of gold markets, offering valuable information on gold's investment and industrial applications.


**8. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF primarily lends for specific development projects, similar to the World Bank.
2.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) offers concessional loans, currently at zero interest rates, tailored to the needs of low-income countries.
3. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) provides short-term financing to middle-income countries facing balance-of-payments crises.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IMF's lending differs from development banks; it doesn't fund specific projects but rather provides financial assistance to countries facing economic crises.

Statement 2 is correct. The PRGT provides concessional financing (currently at zero interest) to low-income countries, aligning with their unique development challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the RST does offer financing to vulnerable middle-income and low-income countries, it focuses on building long-term resilience against external shocks, not primarily short-term balance-of-payments issues.  The timeframe for RST lending is longer than that typically associated with short-term crisis response.


**9. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds, enabling investment in infrastructure projects like toll roads, power transmission lines, and pipelines.
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates InvITs, and they are recognized as borrowers under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).
3.  InvITs primarily generate income through dividends paid by the underlying infrastructure assets and distribute this income to investors as tax-exempt earnings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. InvITs function as investment vehicles, allowing participation in infrastructure projects, as described.

Statement 2 is also correct. SEBI regulates InvITs, and they are indeed recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, facilitating debt recovery mechanisms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While InvITs do distribute income to investors, this income is *taxable*, not tax-exempt.  The tax implications for investors vary depending on their individual circumstances and applicable tax laws.


**10. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seven CRAs are registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), including Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, and Brickwork Ratings.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) solely regulates all aspects of CRAs' operations within India.
3.  SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to publicly disclose their rating methodologies and conflict-of-interest policies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The listed CRAs are accurately identified as registered with SEBI.  The statement correctly reflects the number of registered CRAs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI does regulate certain aspects of CRAs, particularly concerning bank loan ratings, SEBI is the primary regulator for most of their activities.  Other agencies also have some regulatory oversight for specific aspects, making the RBI's role less exclusive.

Statement 3 is correct. SEBI regulations require the transparency of CRA methodologies and conflict-of-interest policies to ensure fair and reliable ratings.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. The HDR, released annually by the World Bank since 1990, examines major global challenges affecting human development.
2. The Human Development Index (HDI), a core component of the HDR, was developed by Amartya Sen and published since 1990.
3. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the HDR is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The World Bank publishes different reports. While both organizations focus on development, their reports and methodologies differ significantly.  The UNDP's focus is broader, encompassing social and environmental aspects alongside economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the HDI was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq, not Amartya Sen. While Sen is a renowned economist who has significantly contributed to the understanding of human development, the HDI's primary architect was Mahbub ul Haq.  Amartya Sen's work, however, has influenced the conceptual framework of human development.

Statement 3 is correct. The GII accurately measures gender inequalities across the three dimensions mentioned.  This index is a crucial tool for understanding and addressing gender disparities in human development.  It provides a quantitative assessment of how far a country has progressed towards gender equality.


**2. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. KISAN, a crop insurance scheme, utilizes satellite technology and Geographic Information Systems for yield estimation.
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a data exchange platform for farmer services, housing data on farmer identity, crop sown data, and farm locations.
3. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) uses only artificial intelligence for informed decision-making in agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. KISAN leverages space technology and geospatial information for accurate yield estimation, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of crop insurance.  This is a key example of how technology is being integrated into India's agricultural practices.

Statement 2 is also correct. ADeX serves as a centralized platform, consolidating crucial data for better farmer service delivery and policy formulation.  The inclusion of geotagged farm locations enhances precision in targeting interventions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the ICCC does utilize artificial intelligence, it also employs other technologies like remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems for comprehensive decision-making in agriculture. This multi-technology approach provides a more holistic view of agricultural conditions.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1. MSP is the minimum rate at which farmers sell their crops to private traders, aimed at preventing distress selling.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, with the final decision resting with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
3. MSP covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because MSP is the minimum rate at which the government *purchases* crops from farmers, not private traders.  The government acts as a buyer of last resort, ensuring farmers receive a guaranteed minimum price, even if market prices fall below this level.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the final decision on MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  The CCEA takes the final decision after considering the CACP's recommendations.

Statement 3 is correct. The MSP system indeed covers the specified number and types of crops, playing a crucial role in supporting farmers' incomes and ensuring food security.


**4. With reference to India’s Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Agricultural exports in India registered a significant increase in 2023-24, exceeding the target of $60 billion set by the 2018 policy.
2. Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices.
3. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) provides assistance for setting up and upgrading export-linked infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided context explicitly states that agricultural exports in India declined by 8% in 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target.  This highlights challenges in meeting export targets despite policy initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct.  Rice, marine products, and spices consistently represent a large portion of India's agricultural exports, reflecting the country's comparative advantages in these sectors.

Statement 3 is also correct.  TIES plays a crucial role in improving the infrastructure necessary for efficient and competitive agricultural exports.  This includes support for border haats, cold chains, and trade promotion centers.

1. The 2024 MPI report, jointly published by the UNDP and the World Bank, indicates that over 1.1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
2. India had the second-largest number of people in extreme poverty according to the 2024 MPI report.
3. The MPI measures poverty based on deprivations in education, health, and living standards; a person is considered MPI poor if deprived in at least one-third of the weighted indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the MPI report is jointly published by the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not the World Bank.  While the World Bank also conducts poverty research, the MPI is a specific initiative of the UNDP and OPHI.

Statement 2 is incorrect because India had the largest number of people in extreme poverty, not the second largest, according to the 2024 MPI report.  This underscores the scale of poverty challenges faced by India.

Statement 3 is correct.  The MPI uses a multidimensional approach, considering various aspects of poverty beyond just income.  The one-third deprivation threshold is a key aspect of its methodology.


**6. With reference to India’s National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI), consider the following statements:**

1. Introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, the NMPI uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) for its calculations.
2. The NMPI includes the 10 original indicators of the global MPI model, along with two additional indicators: maternal health and bank account access.
3. The NMPI value is calculated by multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), where 'H' represents the percentage of the population below the poverty line and 'A' represents the average proportion of deprivations experienced by the multidimensionally poor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  The NFHS provides comprehensive data on household characteristics and health, while the NSS focuses on various socio-economic aspects.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMPI builds upon the global MPI but incorporates additional indicators relevant to the Indian context, providing a more nuanced understanding of poverty.

Statement 3 is correct. The formula accurately describes the calculation of the NMPI value, combining the headcount ratio and the intensity of poverty to provide a comprehensive measure.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Variable Repo Rate (VRR):**

1. The VRR, determined by the market, is always lower than the repo rate and is used for loans with durations of one day.
2. The VRR is a tool used by the RBI to inject short-term liquidity into the banking system when banks are reluctant to borrow at the repo rate due to lower market interest rates.
3. The Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) is used to inject excess liquidity into the banking system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The VRR is generally lower than the repo rate (but not below the reverse repo rate), and it applies to loans with durations exceeding one day, usually up to 14 days. The duration is not restricted to just one day.

Statement 2 is correct. The VRR serves as a mechanism for the RBI to inject liquidity when market conditions make borrowing at the repo rate less attractive for banks. This flexibility ensures efficient liquidity management.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The VRRR is used to *absorb* excess liquidity from the system, not inject it.  It's the opposite function of the VRR.


**8. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently revised PSL guidelines to discourage lending to small businesses in economically disadvantaged districts.
2. PSL norms mandate that banks allocate a certain percentage of their lending to priority sectors, including agriculture, small-scale industries, and education.
3. The revised PSL guidelines aim to promote larger loan sizes in economically disadvantaged districts to encourage higher economic activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI revised PSL guidelines to *promote* small loans in economically disadvantaged districts, not discourage them.  The aim is to increase financial inclusion and support businesses in these areas.

Statement 2 is correct. PSL norms are a crucial aspect of India's banking system, directing credit flow towards sectors deemed essential for economic development and social welfare.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The revised guidelines aim to promote *smaller* loan sizes in these districts, not larger ones. This is to ensure that more small businesses can access credit.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Logistics Performance Index (LPI):**

1. The LPI, released biennially by the World Trade Organization (WTO), ranks countries based on their performance in trade logistics.
2. The LPI considers six parameters, including customs performance, infrastructure quality, and timeliness of shipments.
3. In the 2023 edition, India's LPI ranking improved significantly, placing it among the top 25 countries globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LPI is developed and released by the World Bank Group, not the WTO. Both organizations are involved in international trade and development, but the LPI is specifically a World Bank initiative.

Statement 2 is correct.  The six parameters accurately reflect the key aspects of logistics performance that contribute to efficient trade.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India's ranking improved in 2023, it did not reach the top 25 globally.  The provided context mentions a goal of being among the top 25 by 2030, indicating ongoing efforts towards improvement.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% to India's GDP, not significantly more than 10%. While seaweed farming has potential for growth, its current contribution to the national GDP is relatively small.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PMMSY has set this ambitious target to boost seaweed production and its economic benefits.  This reflects the government's focus on promoting sustainable aquaculture.

Statement 3 is also correct. NIOT-ACOSTI's initiative demonstrates the ongoing efforts to explore and develop seaweed cultivation in suitable regions of India.  This is a key step in advancing the seaweed value chain.



**1. With reference to government initiatives for infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years (FY22 to FY26) by monetising government assets.
2. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant to enhance project viability.
3. The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) primarily supports Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects in the renewable energy sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The NMP indeed aims to generate investment through asset monetization, but the timeframe is four years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  The target amount of ₹6.0 lakh crore is accurate.  The slight inaccuracy in the timeframe makes the statement partially incorrect, but given the other options, it's the closest to being entirely true.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%, as a capital grant to improve project feasibility. This is a significant factual error.


Statement 3 is incorrect. While the IIPDF does aid in developing PPP projects, it doesn't focus solely on the renewable energy sector.  Its support extends to various infrastructure projects.  This statement misrepresents the scope of the IIPDF.


Therefore, only statement 1 is partially correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer.  The other options include completely false statements.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details related to Indian infrastructure development initiatives, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall.  A candidate might be tempted by statement 2 or 3 due to their partial accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the distractors.


**2. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 4% per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹5 crore.
2. The AIF's recent expansion includes allowing convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for individual farmers only.
3.  NABARD Sanrakshan now solely provides AIF credit guarantee coverage for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 3% per annum, not 4%, and the credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE is for loans up to ₹2 crore, not ₹5 crore.  These are crucial numerical inaccuracies.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The AIF's expansion allows convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM not only for individual farmers but also for groups of farmers, FPOs, and Panchayats.  The statement is too restrictive in its description.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  While NABARD Sanrakshan is involved in extending AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs, it does not do so *solely*.  The CGTMSE also continues to play a role. The statement presents a false exclusivity.


All three statements contain factual inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the AIF's details and its recent expansions, requiring precise recall of numerical data and program details.  The inclusion of partially correct but ultimately inaccurate statements serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information.


**3. With reference to India's initiatives in the space sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The SpaceTech Innovation Network is a public-private partnership focused solely on large corporations in the space industry.
2. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) exclusively supports university-level projects in the space sector.
3. 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted for the manufacturing of components and systems/sub-systems for satellites, under automatic route.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SpaceTech Innovation Network supports startups and MSMEs, not only large corporations. The statement incorrectly restricts the network's scope.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) ATL Space Challenge encourages participation from students at various educational levels, not exclusively universities.  The statement is too narrow in its description.


Statement 3 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route for the manufacturing of components and systems/sub-systems for satellites, ground segment, and user segment.


Therefore, only statement 3 is correct, making (a) the correct option.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific policies and programs related to India's space sector, demanding precise factual recall and an understanding of the nuances of FDI regulations. The incorrect statements serve as plausible distractors, testing the ability to distinguish between partially correct and entirely accurate information.


**4. With reference to asset monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The top three sectors contributing to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) are Roads, Railways, and Power, collectively accounting for over 75% of the total pipeline value.
2. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended asset monetization in 2010.
3. Asset monetization primarily involves the outright sale of government-owned assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Roads, Railways, and Power are indeed among the top sectors in the NMP,  the text specifies that the top five sectors account for ~83% of the aggregate pipeline.  The statement oversimplifies the distribution and slightly misrepresents the exact percentage. However, it's closer to the truth than the other options.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vijay Kelkar Committee recommended asset monetization in 2012, not 2010.  This is a significant chronological error.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Asset monetization typically involves licensing or leasing of assets, not outright sales, for a specified period in exchange for payments. This is a fundamental misrepresentation of the process.

Therefore, only statement 1 is the closest to being entirely correct, making (a) the best option.  The question tests detailed knowledge of asset monetization in India, including the composition of the NMP and the historical context of its inception.  The inclusion of statements with subtle inaccuracies or fundamental misconceptions serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between partially correct and entirely accurate information.


**5. With reference to India's efforts towards oilseed self-sufficiency, consider the following statements:**

2. Angel investors primarily invest pooled institutional funds, seeking larger ownership stakes in established companies.
3. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans exclusively to startups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Venture capitalists typically invest in startups with proven market traction and validated business models, not at very early stages before such validation.  This is a misconception about the investment strategy of venture capitalists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Angel investors invest personal funds, not pooled institutional funds, at earlier, riskier stages to support startups' initial growth. They seek larger ownership stakes in early-stage ventures, not established ones.  The statement confuses the roles of angel investors and venture capitalists.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, not exclusively to startups.  This is a significant misrepresentation of the scheme's target beneficiaries.

All three statements are factually incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for all MFIs operating in the country, irrespective of their size or type.
2.  Loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) are categorized into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with the Tarun category having a loan limit of ₹20 lakh as of 2024.
3.  The Malegam Committee's 2010 recommendations focused solely on regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) that operate as MFIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While the RBI is the primary regulator for MFIs, the extent of regulation can vary based on the MFI's structure and operations.  Some smaller MFIs may fall under the purview of state-level authorities.  The statement oversimplifies the regulatory landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the loan limit of ₹20 lakh. The 2024 Union Budget enhanced the limit to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) only for those who had previously availed and successfully repaid loans under the Tarun category.  The original Tarun category loan limit was ₹10 lakh.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Malegam Committee's 2010 recommendations provided a broader framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs, but its scope extended beyond just NBFCs operating as MFIs.  It aimed to address various aspects of the microfinance sector's regulation to ensure financial stability and protect borrowers.


**2. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID was established under the Companies Act, 2013, and is classified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) by the Central Government.
2.  NaBFID's primary objective is to solely provide short-term, recourse-based infrastructure financing in India.
3.  To be notified as a PFI, an institution must be established under a Central or State Act, or at least 51% of its paid-up share capital must be held by the central or state government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID aims to support the development of *long-term non-recourse* infrastructure financing, not short-term, recourse-based financing.  Non-recourse financing means the lender cannot seek repayment from the borrower's other assets if the project fails.

Statement 3 is correct. This accurately describes the criteria for an institution to be classified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) in India.


**3. With reference to the  Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) concerns regarding the Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio of banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  A high CD ratio always indicates robust economic growth and minimal risk for banks.
2.  The CD ratio peaked at 78.8% in December 2023, the highest since 2005, with over 75% of banks exceeding 75% being public sector banks.
3.  Factors contributing to a high CD ratio include slower deposit growth due to customers shifting funds to capital markets and higher credit growth driven by retail credit and loans to businesses and MSMEs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A high CD ratio, while potentially stimulating economic growth by increasing lending, also carries increased risk for banks.  It indicates that a large portion of a bank's funds are tied up in loans, potentially leaving them vulnerable to loan defaults or liquidity issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CD ratio did peak at 78.8% in December 2023 (the highest since 2005), the RBI report states that *over 75% of the banks with CD ratios above 75%* were private sector banks, not public sector banks.

Statement 3 is correct. This accurately identifies the key reasons behind the high CD ratio observed in 2023.  The shift of customer funds from savings accounts to investment avenues slowed deposit growth, while increased lending to various sectors fueled credit growth.


**4. With reference to initiatives taken by the Indian government to improve the logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS focuses on the *rural* population, not the urban population, to assess their financial inclusion status.

Statement 2 is correct.  NAFINEX utilizes data collected through NAFIS to measure financial inclusion in rural areas, encompassing various financial services.

3.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) to calculate its index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report indicated that *approximately 1.1 billion people (~18%)* live in acute multidimensional poverty, not less than 1 billion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MPI considers multiple deprivations across various dimensions, including education, health, and living standards, not solely economic deprivations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMPI uses data from the *National Family Health Survey (NFHS)*, not the National Sample Survey (NSS).

2. The USOF, predating the DBN, was a non-lapsable fund generated by a levy of 10% on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.
3.  The DBN's funding mechanism involves a levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees, similar to the USOF but with a potentially adjusted percentage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is correct. The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, indeed replaced the USOF and aims to fund telecom projects in underserved areas to ensure affordable connectivity. This reflects a policy shift towards bridging the digital divide.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The USOF levied 5%, not 10%, of the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees. This detail is crucial for understanding the financial mechanics of the fund and its impact on the telecom industry.

Statement 3 is correct. While the exact percentage may vary, the DBN, like its predecessor, the USOF, relies on a levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees as its primary funding source. This ensures a continuous flow of resources for its stated objectives.  The question cleverly uses the word "potentially" to make the statement true without explicitly stating the actual percentage.


**3. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals with annual incomes exceeding ₹3,00,000.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹20 lakh under the ‘Tarun Plus’ category to those who have previously availed and repaid loans under the ‘Tarun’ category.
3.  The Malegam Committee, in its 2010 report, recommended a regulatory framework specifically for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) involved in microfinance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households with an annual income *up to*, not exceeding, ₹3,00,000. This is a critical distinction in understanding the target population for microfinance initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget did indeed enhance the PMMY loan limit to ₹20 lakh under the ‘Tarun Plus’ category for those with a successful repayment history under the ‘Tarun’ category.  This shows a government effort to scale up microfinance support.

2. The NMPI includes ten indicators from the global MPI model, along with two additional indicators: maternal health and access to banking services.
3.  The NMPI value is calculated by multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), where 'A' represents the average number of deprivations experienced by the multidimensionally poor.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) indeed aims to generate investment by monetising government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs, but it doesn't handle all aspects of project implementation.  Various other ministries and agencies are involved in the execution of individual projects.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not just state-level ones.  The statement misrepresents the committee's purview, focusing on a subset of the projects it reviews.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct; the Malegam Committee did recommend a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs. Statement 1 is incorrect because the 2024 Union Budget *increased* the loan limit for the Tarun category (creating Tarun Plus), not reduced it. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs in India.  The question uses contrasting information about the PMMY loan categories and the RBI's role to challenge the candidate's understanding of microfinance regulation and government initiatives.


**7. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the VGF provides up to 40%, not 50%, of project costs as a capital grant.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation on asset monetization was made in 2012, not 2010. These minor inaccuracies, while seemingly insignificant, demonstrate the need for precise factual recall in the UPSC exam.  The question highlights the importance of verifying information and avoiding assumptions, even when dealing with seemingly familiar concepts.  A candidate might be familiar with the NMP and VGF but could still fall into the trap of incorrect figures, illustrating the need for precise knowledge.  Further, the date of the Kelkar Committee report is a detail that could easily be misremembered, leading to an incorrect answer.

3. MSP currently covers 25 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  The MSP is indeed the minimum price guaranteed by the government, but it's primarily for procurement by government agencies, not a mandated price for private sales (Statement 1 is incorrect). While the CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision lies with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (Statement 2 is incorrect).

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; agricultural exports experienced an 8% decline in 2023-24, not a 10% increase.  While rice is a significant export, it does not constitute the largest share; that share belongs to marine products (Statement 2 is incorrect).  Statement 3 accurately describes APEDA's role. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's agricultural export performance and the institutional framework supporting it. The incorrect options highlight the importance of precise data recall regarding export figures and the relative shares of various agricultural products in the export basket.  Knowing APEDA's role is crucial for understanding the promotion and regulation of agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The NMP involves monetizing existing government assets, but it's not solely limited to PPP projects (Statement 1 is incorrect). The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not just state-level ones (Statement 2 is incorrect).  Statement 3 accurately reflects the FDI policy related to PPPs in India. This question assesses understanding of the PPP framework and related government initiatives.  The incorrect options highlight potential misconceptions about the scope of the NMP and the appraisal process for PPP projects.  The FDI policy regarding PPPs is a critical aspect of attracting private investment in infrastructure development.

2.  NBFCs are subject to Scale-based Regulation (SBR) based on their size and risk profile.
3. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures deposits held in NBFCs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits; this is a key distinction from banks (Statement 1 is incorrect).  The SBR framework does indeed categorize NBFCs based on size and risk, leading to differential regulations.  DICGC insurance does not cover NBFC deposits (Statement 3 is incorrect). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory framework for NBFCs in India. The incorrect options highlight the key differences between banks and NBFCs, which are frequently tested in the UPSC exam.  Understanding the SBR is crucial for grasping the regulatory approach to managing risk within the NBFC sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the key criteria for establishing a PACS, as specified in the provided text.  PACS are indeed required to have at least two hundred members and possess net owned funds exceeding ten lakh rupees.  Statement 1 is incorrect because PACS do not directly interact with the RBI; their operations are primarily within the cooperative banking structure.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While credit facilities are a core function, PACS often play a broader role in agricultural services, extending beyond just lending.  They might be involved in procurement, input supply, and other agricultural support activities, depending on their specific mandate and local context. The focus on credit in statement 3 misrepresents the multifaceted nature of PACS operations.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the RBI's observation regarding the rural FMCG sector. The RBI cited this sector as showcasing Green Shoots, indicating positive growth after an economic downturn.  Statement 1 is incorrect because Green Shoots signal economic recovery or growth, not contraction. They represent early signs of improvement in an economy or sector after a period of decline. Statement 3 is also incorrect; Green Shoots are not limited to agriculture. The term is used more broadly to describe positive economic indicators across various sectors, including manufacturing, services, and others, whenever positive growth is observed after a period of economic slowdown.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the geographical concentration of groundnut production in India.  The mentioned states contribute a substantial portion of the country's total groundnut output. Statement 1 is incorrect; a significant portion of oilseed cultivation in India is rain-fed, making it vulnerable to variations in rainfall.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the "Yellow Revolution" aimed at boosting the production of edible oils, particularly from mustard and sesame seeds, not rice and wheat.  The focus was on enhancing domestic oilseed production to reduce reliance on imports and improve nutritional security.


**5. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is determined solely by the market forces of supply and demand.
2.  The MSP covers a wide range of crops, including both kharif and rabi crops, as well as some commercial crops.
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency responsible for purchasing all MSP-covered crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the MSP mechanism encompasses a diverse range of crops, including kharif and rabi crops, and also some commercial crops. Statement 1 is incorrect because MSP is not determined by pure market forces.  It is a government-set price floor aimed at protecting farmers from distress selling and ensuring a minimum income.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the FCI is a major procuring agency, it doesn't handle all MSP-covered crops.  Other agencies and state governments also participate in the procurement process depending on the crop and regional context.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 correctly identifies the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana as an initiative aimed at increasing seaweed production in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect; seaweed farming is done in both marine and inland water bodies.

3.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) provides deposit insurance coverage to depositors of NBFCs up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because NBFCs are specifically prohibited from accepting demand deposits. This is a key distinction between NBFCs and banks. Statement 2 is incorrect as the regulation of NBFCs is not solely under the RBI.  Different types of NBFCs are regulated by various entities including the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, SEBI, and state governments depending on their specific activities (e.g., housing finance companies, chit fund companies, etc.). Statement 3 is also incorrect; the DICGC deposit insurance facility does *not* extend to NBFCs.  Depositors in NBFCs do not have the same level of protection as depositors in banks. This difference in regulatory oversight and deposit insurance highlights the higher risk associated with investing in NBFCs compared to banks.


**2. With reference to the Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SBR categorizes NBFCs into three tiers based solely on their asset size.
2.  NBFCs in higher tiers under the SBR face stricter regulatory requirements compared to those in lower tiers.
3.  The primary goal of SBR is to enhance the profitability of NBFCs by reducing regulatory burden on smaller entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SBR for NBFCs uses a multi-faceted approach, categorizing them into four layers based on their size, activity, and perceived riskiness, not solely asset size.  Statement 2 is correct. The core principle of SBR is risk-based supervision, meaning that NBFCs classified as higher risk (due to size, activities, etc.) face more stringent regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements than lower-risk entities. This is a crucial aspect of maintaining financial stability. Statement 3 is incorrect. The primary goal is not to enhance profitability but to improve the overall stability and resilience of the NBFC sector by tailoring regulations to the specific risk profiles of different NBFCs.  Reducing the regulatory burden on smaller entities is a secondary consideration, balanced against the need to mitigate systemic risk.


**3. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the Indian financial system, consider the following statements:**

1.  An NPA is defined as a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 180 days.
2.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, is primarily designed to address NPAs in the public sector banks only.
3.  The Financial Stability Report (FSR) is published annually by the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; an NPA is typically defined as a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days.  The exact definition might vary slightly depending on the lending institution but 90 days is the generally accepted benchmark. Statement 2 is incorrect. The IBC, 2016, is designed to address insolvency and bankruptcy across a wide range of entities, including corporate debtors, partnerships, and individuals, and is not limited to public sector banks.  It aims to provide a more efficient and time-bound mechanism for resolving stressed assets, including those resulting in NPAs. Statement 3 is incorrect. The FSR is published biannually (twice a year), not annually, by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Ministry of Finance, reflecting the RBI's role in monitoring and maintaining financial stability.


**4. With reference to Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All UCBs are directly regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs is designed to improve their capital adequacy and asset quality.
3.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UCBs are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. SEBI regulates the securities market, while RBI oversees the banking sector. Statement 2 is correct. The PCA framework for UCBs is designed to address issues related to financial health, focusing on capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.  Early intervention through the PCA framework aims to prevent further deterioration of a UCB's financial condition. Statement 3 is also correct. NUCFDC acts as an umbrella organization and SRO for UCBs, aiming to improve their regulatory compliance, provide liquidity support, and facilitate technological advancements within the sector.  The establishment of an SRO reflects a move towards self-regulation within the UCB sector, under the overall supervision of the RBI.

2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not regulate MFIs operating in India; instead, it is regulated by the Ministry of Finance.
3.  All loans under PMMY are collateral-free, irrespective of the loan amount.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PMMY aims to provide loans to micro and small enterprises, it doesn't exclusively channel funds through MFIs. Commercial banks and NBFCs are also involved in disbursing loans under PMMY. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI is the primary regulatory body for MFIs in India, not the Ministry of Finance.  The RBI's regulatory framework ensures the responsible and sustainable growth of the microfinance sector. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While PMMY aims to provide access to credit, loans under this scheme are not all necessarily collateral-free;  collateral requirements might vary depending on the loan amount and other factors.  The availability of collateral-free loans is a key aspect of microfinance, but it's not a universal feature of all PMMY loans.


**6. With reference to Nidhi Companies in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nidhi companies are regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), not the RBI.  The MCA oversees their incorporation, operations, and compliance with company law. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Nidhi companies are primarily designed to operate within a closed membership system. They primarily accept deposits from and lend to their members only, promoting mutual benefit and financial assistance within the group. Statement 3 is correct. The core function of a Nidhi company is to provide financial assistance to its members through the pooling of their savings. This mutual benefit aspect distinguishes them from other types of financial institutions.  Their activities are closely scrutinized to ensure they adhere to their stated purpose and do not engage in activities beyond their defined scope.

1.  Tariffication, a key component of Market Access under the Agreement, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, including quotas and variable levies.
2.  The "Domestic Support" pillar of the Agreement addresses subsidies and support programs that directly stimulate production and distort trade, categorized into various "boxes" based on subsidy types.
3.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 mandated the complete elimination of export subsidies for both developed and developing countries, thereby creating a level playing field for agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Tariffication is a core principle of the Agreement on Agriculture, aiming to make trade policies more transparent and predictable by replacing non-tariff barriers with tariffs.  Quotas and variable levies are indeed examples of non-tariff barriers that need to be converted.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Agreement on Agriculture explicitly addresses domestic support measures, classifying them into different "boxes" (Amber Box, Blue Box, Green Box) based on their trade-distorting potential.  This categorization is crucial for managing subsidies and their impact on global agricultural markets.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Nairobi Ministerial Decision did aim to curb export subsidies, it didn't lead to their complete elimination for all WTO members.  Developing countries were given more time and flexibility in phasing out their export subsidies compared to developed nations.  The complete elimination was a goal, but the implementation varied based on the country's development status and specific circumstances.  The statement presents an oversimplification of a complex issue.


**2. With reference to the Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security, consider the following statements:**

1.  Developing countries advocate for an increase in the "de minimis" limit and amendments to the formula used to calculate price support subsidies for government procurement, arguing that the current system unfairly penalizes their food security programs.
2.  Developed countries generally contend that PSH programs distort markets and should be subject to stricter limitations, even proposing the complete elimination of export restrictions related to food stockholding.
3.  The "Peace Clause," agreed upon at the 9th Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali, provides a permanent solution to the concerns surrounding PSH, ensuring that countries' food security programs are not challenged under WTO rules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the position of many developing countries.  They argue that the existing "de minimis" limits and the formula for calculating price support subsidies are inadequate and hinder their ability to maintain essential food security programs.  They seek adjustments to allow for greater flexibility and higher levels of support.

Statement 2 correctly describes the stance of many developed countries. They often view PSH programs as potentially trade-distorting, advocating for stricter regulations or limitations on such programs. Their concerns center around the potential for unfair competition in global agricultural markets.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "Peace Clause" was an *interim* solution, not a permanent one.  It provided temporary protection for countries' PSH programs while negotiations continued to find a lasting solution.  The issue of PSH remains a significant point of contention within the WTO.


**3. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement, adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva in 2022, aims to eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks globally.
2.  The Agreement focuses primarily on curbing harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks, rather than aiming for a complete ban on all subsidies in the fisheries sector.
3. The Geneva Package represents a significant step towards a permanent solution to the problem of unsustainable fisheries subsidies, effectively resolving the issue of overfishing worldwide.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Package does not aim to eliminate *all* fisheries subsidies. It targets harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing and unsustainable practices.  Some subsidies, particularly those promoting sustainable fishing practices, are not included in the ban.

Statement 2 is correct. The Agreement focuses on identifying and eliminating subsidies that negatively impact fish stocks.  The goal is to promote responsible fishing practices and ensure the long-term health of marine ecosystems.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Geneva Package is a significant step, it does not represent a complete resolution to the problem of unsustainable fisheries subsidies.  Implementation and enforcement of the agreement remain ongoing challenges, and the issue of overfishing continues to be a concern in many parts of the world.  The statement overstates the impact and finality of the agreement.


**4. With reference to the inverted duty structure (IDS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS arises when the GST rate on imported input goods is lower than the GST rate on the finished goods produced using these inputs, leading to a situation where domestic manufacturers face a competitive disadvantage.
2.  The impact of IDS includes increased costs for domestic products, hindering their competitiveness in both the domestic and export markets, and creating working capital issues for taxpayers due to blocked Input Tax Credit (ITC).
3.  Under the GST regime, taxpayers facing IDS are not eligible for Input Tax Credit (ITC) refunds, exacerbating the financial burden on domestic businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDS occurs when the GST rate on *imported input goods* is *higher* than the GST rate on the *finished goods*. This creates a disadvantage for domestic producers because their input costs are artificially inflated, making their products less competitive.

Statement 2 is correct. The higher input costs due to IDS make domestic products more expensive, impacting their competitiveness in both the domestic and export markets. This also leads to working capital issues as the Input Tax Credit (ITC) remains blocked, causing liquidity problems for businesses.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Taxpayers facing IDS *are* eligible for ITC refunds under the GST regime.  However, the process of obtaining these refunds can be cumbersome and time-consuming, leading to further financial strain. The statement incorrectly states that refunds are unavailable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Windfall taxes target industries with *significantly above-average* profits due to *favorable* economic conditions, not below-average profits.  The tax is levied when exceptional circumstances lead to disproportionate gains.

Statement 2 is correct. The main rationale behind windfall taxes is to capture excess profits generated due to external factors and use this revenue for broader societal benefits, such as public welfare programs or infrastructure development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Governments typically justify windfall taxes by arguing that the extraordinary profits are not solely attributable to the taxed entity's efforts but are also influenced by external factors like favorable market conditions or unexpected price surges.  This contrasts with the statement's assertion.

Statement 2 is correct. India's EEZ is indeed rich in offshore mineral resources, including potentially significant reserves of gold, diamonds, and rare earth elements. However, the statement accurately reflects the ongoing nature of exploration and assessment, acknowledging the uncertainties inherent in quantifying these reserves precisely.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The rules do mandate rigorous exploration standards using UNFC and CRIRSCO. However, the statement's claim about the lack of specific provisions for environmental impact assessments is misleading. While the rules might not explicitly detail the process, environmental considerations are implicitly integrated into sustainable development principles, and separate environmental regulations would govern such assessments.  The rules themselves do not address environmental impact assessments explicitly, but this is addressed through other environmental regulations.


**4. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank lending mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF's General Resources Account (GRA) provides financial support to member countries on concessional terms, tailored to the specific developmental needs of low-income countries, unlike its other lending instruments.
2. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) aims to increase the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030, primarily by providing credit guarantees for infrastructure projects in developing nations.
3. The IMF's "Gold Tranche" (Reserve Tranche) is a credit facility accessible to all IMF member countries, providing short-term liquidity support without any conditions attached, unlike other IMF lending programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GRA provides financial support on *non-concessional* terms (market-based interest rates), unlike the PRGT and RST which offer concessional financing.  The statement incorrectly attributes concessional terms to the GRA.

Statement 2 is correct. The WBG-GP aims to significantly increase the World Bank's guarantee issuance, primarily focusing on infrastructure projects. This increase in guarantees is a key goal to boost private sector investment in infrastructure, particularly in developing countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Gold Tranche is accessible to all members and provides short-term liquidity, the statement incorrectly claims it has *no* conditions attached.  While less stringent than other IMF programs, there are still reporting and data requirements associated with accessing the Gold Tranche.  The statement misrepresents the conditions associated with accessing the Gold Tranche.


**5. With reference to India's agricultural policies and the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1. India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism covers 22 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops, but excludes commercial crops like jute and copra, focusing primarily on food security crops.
2. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture includes provisions on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies, with developed countries having eliminated export subsidies under the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015, but developing countries facing ongoing challenges in this regard.
3. The WTO's "peace clause" on public stockholding (PSH) provides a temporary solution to the issue of food security subsidies, allowing developing countries to maintain their PSH programs without facing trade penalties, but a permanent solution remains elusive.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP mechanism *does* include commercial crops like jute and copra, along with Kharif and Rabi crops.  The statement incorrectly excludes these crucial commercial crops from the MSP framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The Agreement on Agriculture covers the three areas mentioned, and developed countries have largely eliminated export subsidies. However, developing countries still face challenges in complying with the agreement's provisions on domestic support and export subsidies.

Statement 3 is correct. The "peace clause" provides a temporary reprieve, but a permanent solution to the PSH issue remains a key point of contention within the WTO, highlighting the ongoing negotiations and complexities surrounding the issue.  The statement accurately reflects the temporary nature of the peace clause and the ongoing pursuit of a permanent solution.


**6. With reference to India's industrial parks and the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NICDP, implemented by NICDIT and NICDC, aims to develop futuristic industrial cities across India, with a primary focus on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and promoting export-oriented industries.
2.  The Union Budget 2024-25 proposed the creation of twelve new industrial parks under the NICDP, strategically located along existing industrial corridors and across multiple states, aiming to create employment opportunities and boost industrial growth in those regions.

1. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS aims to curb tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) through a two-pillar approach, including the reallocation of profits to market jurisdictions and the implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate.
2. The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, signed by India in 2017, focuses on updating international tax rules to reduce opportunities for tax avoidance by MNEs, primarily by harmonizing tax treaties across countries.
3.  Duty drawback, as implemented by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), rebates customs duty on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods, but does not cover excise duties levied on domestically produced materials used in the export process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS indeed uses a two-pillar approach to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by MNEs, including profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate.  The statement accurately describes the framework's core objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. The Multilateral Convention aims to update international tax rules to prevent BEPS, primarily by harmonizing tax treaties and reducing discrepancies that MNEs can exploit for tax avoidance.  India's participation in this convention reflects its commitment to international tax cooperation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Duty drawback mechanisms typically cover customs duties on *both* imported and domestically produced (excisable) materials used in the manufacture of export goods. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of duty drawback to only imported materials.  The statement misrepresents the scope of duty drawback.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While NaBFID is a PFI notified under the Companies Act, 2013, it was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021. Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID focuses on long-term, non-recourse financing, not short-term high-interest loans. Statement 3 is correct. Supporting the development of relevant financial markets is a key part of NaBFID's mandate. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements about India's steel sector:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 exceeded the world average.
2.  The high energy intensity of steel production makes it a significant contributor to carbon emissions globally.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's per capita steel consumption is significantly lower than the world average. Statement 2 is correct. Steel production is indeed a major source of global carbon emissions. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Indian steel exports to the EU are facing challenges due to the EU's carbon tax.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  RELOS is a bilateral agreement between India and China, facilitating military logistics cooperation.
2.  Under RELOS, participating countries can access each other's military bases and ports for fuel and ration replenishment.
3.  India currently has RELOS agreements with all members of the BRICS group.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that Russia approved a draft RELOS with India, not China. Statement 2 is correct.  The agreement allows for mutual access to logistics support facilities. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text only lists some countries with whom India has similar agreements; it does not state that all BRICS members are included.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the World Trade Organization (WTO):**

1. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, led to the establishment of the WTO, replacing the GATT.
2.  The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi reached a permanent solution to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue for developing countries.
3. The WTO's de minimis limits on agricultural subsidies are calculated based on the reference prices from 1986-88.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement established the WTO. Statement 2 is incorrect. The MC13 did not resolve the PSH issue permanently. Statement 3 is correct. The de minimis limits calculation uses the 1986-88 reference prices. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**9. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. PM GatiShakti uses a digital master planning tool developed by ISRO, leveraging satellite imagery for infrastructure planning.
2. The plan integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and inland waterways projects.
3. PM GatiShakti's seven engines exclusively focus on hard infrastructure development, excluding soft infrastructure aspects like logistics policy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While PM GatiShakti utilizes GIS and satellite imagery, it's BISAG-N (not solely ISRO) that developed the digital tool. Statement 2 is correct. The plan integrates data from numerous ministries concerning various infrastructure projects. Statement 3 is incorrect. While PM GatiShakti focuses on hard infrastructure, it also indirectly supports soft infrastructure through integrated planning and efficient resource allocation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct.  Statement 1 is partially true but not fully accurate.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for all aspects of PPP project implementation.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state-level PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit is involved in policy matters, but implementation involves other agencies as well.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The committee primarily focuses on central sector projects. Statement 3 is correct. The NMP's objective is to attract investment by monetizing government assets.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct.


**1. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port (formerly Kolkata Port) is India's oldest major port and the only major riverine port.
2. Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) in Tamil Nadu is the largest natural harbor in India, and it's also the only corporatized major port registered as a company.
3.  The Major Port Authorities Act, 2021 governs both major and non-major ports in India, allowing for private sector participation in all port projects through concession agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port, formerly known as Kolkata Port, holds the distinction of being India's oldest major port and the only major riverine port.  This historical significance and its unique location on the Hooghly River are crucial aspects of India's port history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) is indeed the only corporatized major port registered as a company,  Mumbai Port is the largest natural harbor in India.  The question attempts to confuse the examinee by combining factual elements related to different ports.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Major Port Authorities Act, 2021, primarily governs major ports. Non-major ports fall under the jurisdiction of state governments and are governed under the Indian Ports Act, 1908.  The statement incorrectly extends the Act's purview and the nature of private sector participation to all ports. Private sector participation is allowed in major ports, but not necessarily all projects and certainly not under the same regulatory framework as non-major ports.


**2. With reference to multimodal logistics in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), managed by DFCCIL, aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 45% in 2019 to 27% by 2030, as part of the National Rail Plan 2030.
2.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana, a national highway construction program, plans to construct approximately 65,000 km of national highways in two phases.
3. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) and PM GatiShakti are initiatives aimed at improving the efficiency of freight transport, incorporating elements like the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target of the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) is to *increase* the share of rail freight traffic, not decrease it. The correct figures are 27% in 2019 and a target of 45% by 2030. The statement reverses these figures, creating a distractor for the examinee.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of national highways, representing a significant investment in India's road infrastructure. This is a well-known fact related to India's infrastructure development.

Statement 3 is correct.  LEEP and PM GatiShakti are indeed focused on improving logistics efficiency, and ULIP and LEADS are integral parts of this broader initiative.  The statement accurately reflects the government's efforts to streamline logistics and enhance the overall efficiency of freight movement within the country.


**3. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  RELOS is a bilateral agreement between India and Russia, allowing only for the exchange of fuel and rations between their militaries.
2.  India has similar agreements with the US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea, focusing solely on wartime logistical support.
3.  Under RELOS, the militaries can access logistical and support facilities at each other's bases and ports, facilitating replenishment of fuel, rations, spare parts, and berthing for troops, warships, and aircraft during both wartime and peacetime missions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RELOS facilitates the exchange of a wider range of logistical support than just fuel and rations.  It includes spare parts and berthing facilities, making the statement an oversimplification of the agreement's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India does have similar agreements with the listed countries, the statement incorrectly limits the focus to wartime support. RELOS and similar agreements extend to peacetime missions as well. This creates a distractor, highlighting a common misconception regarding such agreements.

Statement 3 is correct. This statement accurately describes the key features and objectives of RELOS, encompassing both wartime and peacetime logistical support.  It correctly identifies the scope of the agreement in terms of the resources and facilities involved.


**4. With reference to India's seaweed farming initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation contributes significantly to India's GDP, currently accounting for over 5% of the total national output.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons per year by 2025, and it includes the development of a GIS-based portal to map cultivation sites.
3. The National Institute of Ocean Technology-Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI) has initiated offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region, focusing primarily on the production of bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical applications.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The fishing and aquaculture sector, which includes seaweed farming, contributes 1.5% to India's GDP, not over 5%.  This is a significant numerical exaggeration designed to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana's target of 1 million tons of seaweed production by 2025 and the development of a GIS-based portal are accurately stated. This is a factual element related to a specific government scheme.

Statement 3 is partially correct in mentioning NIOT-ACOSTI's initiative in the Andaman region but is misleading by overemphasizing pharmaceutical applications. While bioactive compounds are a valuable aspect, the broader significance of seaweed farming includes economic and environmental benefits.  The statement focuses on a narrow application, creating a distractor.


**5. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is the primary body responsible for overseeing the implementation of all PPP projects, including those at the state level.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects, while central sector projects are assessed by a separate committee.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit plays a significant role in policy matters concerning PPPs, it does not directly oversee the implementation of all projects at all levels.  State-level projects have their own regulatory mechanisms.  This introduces a hierarchical complexity to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  The statement incorrectly assigns the committee's responsibility to state-level projects and creates a false distinction.


Statement 3 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) and its target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) are factual and well-known aspects of India's infrastructure financing strategy.  This is a straightforward, verifiable fact.


**6. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following statements:**

1. Offshore mining in India is limited to areas within 200 meters of the coast, focusing primarily on the extraction of construction-grade sand.
2. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons, as defined under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.
3.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable offshore mineral resources, including gold, diamonds, copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and rare earth elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Offshore mining extends to depths beyond 200 meters, encompassing a wider range of minerals than just construction-grade sand. This is a significant misrepresentation of the scope of offshore mining activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rules explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  The statement falsely includes these excluded resources. This is a crucial detail that would distinguish a well-prepared candidate.

Statement 3 is correct.  The statement accurately reflects the vast mineral wealth present within India's EEZ, encompassing a diverse range of valuable resources.  This is a widely known fact relating to India's potential for offshore mineral extraction.


**7. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty is a legally binding agreement adopted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK).
2.  The treaty acknowledges the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and includes provisions for the equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of traditional knowledge.
3. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is a key initiative undertaken by India to protect its traditional knowledge and prevent biopiracy, and it is not directly related to the implementation of this new treaty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. First, the treaty was adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), not the WTO. Second, while the treaty is legally binding once ratified, the statement presents it as already a fully implemented agreement.

Statement 2 is correct. The treaty explicitly acknowledges UNDRIP and aims to ensure fair and equitable benefit-sharing.  This is a crucial element of the treaty's purpose.

Statement 3 is correct. While TKDL is a significant initiative for protecting traditional knowledge, its direct connection to the implementation of this specific treaty is not explicitly stated or necessarily implied.  The statement correctly highlights the independent nature of TKDL.  The question aims to test the candidate's understanding of the separate but related initiatives in this area.


**1. With reference to the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India Stack, India's foundational DPI, comprises three interconnected layers: an identity layer (Aadhaar), a payment layer (UPI), and a data governance layer (DigiLocker).  These layers are completely independent and do not interact with each other.
2.  The One Future Alliance, a G20 initiative, aims to provide technical assistance and funding for DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries, focusing solely on capacity building within the respective countries.
3.  The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR), launched at the 2023 G20 summit, is a centralized institution responsible for the development, implementation, and regulation of all DPI initiatives globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while Aadhaar, UPI, and DigiLocker are key components of India Stack,  the statement incorrectly claims they are completely independent.  These layers are designed to be interconnected and interoperable, enabling seamless data exchange and service delivery.  The strength of India Stack lies precisely in this integration.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the One Future Alliance, while focused on capacity building, also encompasses technical assistance and funding support for DPI implementation in developing nations.  It's not limited to solely capacity building within the recipient countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect because the GDPIR is not a centralized regulatory body. Its role is more focused on establishing a collaborative platform for knowledge sharing and best practices concerning DPI, rather than dictating global implementation or regulations.


**2. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides loans to eligible beneficiaries with a 5% interest subvention per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹5 Crores.
2.  Recent AIF expansions include allowing integrated primary and secondary processing projects and convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for farmer groups and cooperatives.
3. NABARD Sanrakshan, a subsidiary of NABARD, has been excluded from extending AIF credit guarantee coverage to Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The interest subvention offered under the AIF is 3% per annum, not 5%, and the credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE is for loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹5 Crores.

Statement 2 is correct. The AIF has indeed expanded to include integrated processing projects and allows for convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for various entities, including FPOs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  NABARD Sanrakshan has been *included*, not excluded, to expand credit guarantee coverage for FPOs under AIF.


**3. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. Appeals against the decisions of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) are directly filed with the High Courts.
2.  The Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) hears appeals from Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs), and further appeals can be made to the Supreme Court within 60 days.
3. The Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) is available for corporate debtors with defaults of at least ₹5 lakh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against NCLAT decisions are made to the Supreme Court, not the High Courts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While DRAT hears appeals from DRTs and further appeals go to the Supreme Court, the time limit is 45 days, not 60 days.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The minimum default amount for initiating PPIRP is ₹10 lakh, not ₹5 lakh.


**4. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Eight CRAs are registered with SEBI, including Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, Brickwork Ratings, and two others.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) accredits all seven CRAs registered with SEBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) for rating bank loans.
3. SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy, but not guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Only seven CRAs are explicitly named as registered with SEBI; the statement incorrectly adds an extra CRA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While most of the named CRAs are RBI-accredited, Brickwork Ratings is the exception.  The statement incorrectly asserts that all seven are accredited.

Statement 3 is incorrect. SEBI regulations *do* require CRAs to disclose guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest, in addition to rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policies.


**5. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds, allowing investment in infrastructure projects such as toll roads and pipelines, but not power lines.
2.  The SEBI amendments to InvIT regulations in 2024 allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only upon the acquisition of infrastructure projects.
3.  InvITs earn income solely through tolls and rents from their investments, distributing this income to investors as tax-exempt earnings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because InvITs *do* allow investment in power lines, along with other specified infrastructure projects.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 SEBI amendments specifically allow for the issuance of subordinate units to sponsors under the conditions mentioned.

Statement 3 is incorrect because InvITs can earn income not only through tolls and rents but also through interest and dividends.  Furthermore, the income distributed to investors is *taxable*, not tax-exempt.


**6. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in using trade for sustainable development and poverty reduction.
2.  The EIF involves 41 countries as partners and is supported by International organizations such as the World Bank and WTO.
3. The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) acts as the EIF Trust Fund Manager.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the EIF is a *multilateral*, not bilateral, partnership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF has 51 partner countries, not 41.

Statement 3 is correct. UNOPS is indeed the EIF Trust Fund Manager.


**7. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI comprises nine core industries, including fertilizers, cement, natural gas, crude oil, coal, electricity, steel, petroleum refinery products, and mining.
2.  Petroleum refinery products contribute the highest weight (30%) to the ICI, followed by electricity (20%).
3. The ICI, released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, accounts for approximately 45% of the weight of items in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the ICI consists of eight core industries, not nine.  Mining is not included.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While petroleum refinery products have the highest weight, the percentages are slightly different from what's stated;  the actual weights are approximately 28.04% for petroleum refinery products and 19.85% for electricity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ICI accounts for approximately 40.27% of the IIP, not 45%.


**8. With reference to the  Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), consider the following statements:**

1. ICAR-NISA, established in 1924, was renamed in 2022 and falls under the Ministry of Rural Development.
2. Secondary agriculture encompasses value addition of primary agricultural products and activities like beekeeping, but excludes agricultural tourism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. ICAR-NISA falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, not the Ministry of Rural Development.

Statement 2 is incorrect because agricultural tourism is indeed considered part of secondary agriculture.

Statement 3 is correct.  The information regarding ICAR's origins and establishment is accurate.


**9. With reference to the Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules were notified by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) under the powers conferred by the Telecommunications Act, 2022.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the enabling act is the Telecommunications Act, 2023, not 2022.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Universal Access Levy was 5%, not 10%, of the Adjusted Gross Revenue.

Statement 3 is incorrect. DBN explicitly aims to fund telecom schemes in *both* underserved and rural areas.



**1. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at streamlining cross-border payments.
2. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS) that could be integrated into Project Nexus.
3. Project Nexus is primarily focused on facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border payments for businesses, rather than individual consumers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative, involving India and several ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand).  It's not limited to a bilateral arrangement with Singapore.  The focus is on interlinking domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across multiple nations to enable instant cross-border retail payments.

Statement 2 is correct.  UPI is explicitly mentioned in the source material as an example of an IPS, the very system Project Nexus seeks to interconnect internationally.  The project aims to leverage existing domestic systems like UPI to create a seamless cross-border payment infrastructure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Project Nexus aims for cheaper and faster transactions, its scope explicitly includes enabling instant cross-border retail payments, benefiting both businesses and individual consumers. The goal is to make cross-border payments more accessible to a wider range of users, not just businesses.  The G20 targets mentioned in the source text further emphasize the broader inclusivity goal.


**2. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs), consider the following statements:**

1. FVCIs are required to invest only in companies listed on major Indian stock exchanges.
2. SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, govern the investments made by FVCIs in India, and these regulations were amended in 2024.
3. Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) in India are not subject to any regulatory oversight by SEBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that FVCIs invest in venture capital funds (registered with SEBI) or venture capital undertakings in India (companies *not* listed in major stock exchanges).  The emphasis is on investments in unlisted companies, which are considered higher risk and higher reward ventures.

Statement 2 is correct. The source explicitly mentions that SEBI issued amended regulations in 2024 to update the existing SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000. This demonstrates that SEBI actively regulates FVCIs and their investment activities within India.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that VCFs are governed by SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, demonstrating that SEBI does indeed regulate VCFs. This regulatory framework ensures transparency and accountability within the Indian venture capital market.


**3. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2. SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs must disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and conflict of interest guidelines.
3.  The RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA do not play any role in the regulation of CRAs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that *except* for Brickwork Ratings, all other six CRAs are RBI-accredited. This indicates that not all SEBI-registered CRAs receive RBI accreditation.  The distinction highlights the different regulatory roles and jurisdictions of SEBI and RBI regarding CRAs.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999, require CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest. This is a crucial aspect of maintaining transparency and accountability in the credit rating process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that regulatory agencies like RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA also regulate certain aspects of CRAs under their respective sectoral jurisdictions. This shows a multi-layered regulatory approach, with different agencies focusing on specific areas relevant to their mandates.


**4. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles exclusively designed for high-net-worth individuals to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects.
2.  SEBI's 2024 amendments to InvIT regulations allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only upon acquisition of an infrastructure project.
3.  InvITs earn income primarily through equity stakes in the infrastructure projects they invest in.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While InvITs do facilitate investment in large-scale infrastructure projects, they are not exclusively for high-net-worth individuals.  The text highlights that InvITs allow investors to invest *small amounts*, suggesting accessibility beyond high-net-worth individuals.  The structure is similar to a mutual fund, allowing for broader participation.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly states that the 2024 SEBI amendments allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only when acquiring an infrastructure project. This addresses valuation discrepancies between sponsors and InvITs during acquisitions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text indicates that InvITs earn income through various means, including tolls, rents, interest, or dividends from their investments.  While equity stakes might be a component, it's not the *primary* or exclusive source of income for InvITs.  The diversity of income streams contributes to the stability and attractiveness of InvIT investments.


**5. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NABFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NABFID was established as a private sector financial institution to promote infrastructure development in India.
2.  NABFID is now notified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013.
3. The primary objective of NABFID is to provide short-term, high-interest loans for small-scale infrastructure projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NABFID was established as a *Development Financial Institution (DFI)*, not a private sector institution.  The fact that it's now notified as a PFI further underscores its public nature.  DFIs are typically government-backed or government-owned entities focused on long-term infrastructure financing.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly states that the Central Government notified NABFID as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013.  This notification grants NABFID the status and associated benefits of a public financial institution.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  NABFID's objective is to support *long-term non-recourse infrastructure financing*.  This implies longer-term loans and a focus on larger, more significant infrastructure projects, rather than short-term loans for small-scale projects.  The emphasis on long-term financing is crucial for major infrastructure development.


**6. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), consider the following statements:**

1. ICAR was established in 1929 based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture.
2.  ICAR-NISA, originally established in 1924, is currently under the administrative control of the Ministry of Rural Development.
3. ICAR’s mandate solely focuses on research and education related to crop production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that ICAR was established in 1929 based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Agriculture (1928). This historical context is crucial in understanding ICAR's foundational role in agricultural research and education in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ICAR-NISA was established in 1924 and is now under ICAR,  it falls under the *Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare*, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This distinction is important as it highlights the focus on agricultural research and development within the broader agricultural sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ICAR's mandate encompasses research and education in agriculture, including horticulture, fisheries, and animal sciences.  This broader scope reflects the interconnectedness of different aspects within the agricultural sector and the need for holistic research and development efforts.


**7. With reference to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PLFS, launched in 2017, provides a comprehensive assessment of employment and unemployment indicators in urban areas only.
2. According to the PLFS, the unemployment rate in India for the calendar year 2023 was significantly higher than the global average unemployment rate.
3. PLFS data is primarily used to formulate and evaluate government policies related to employment and labour market dynamics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PLFS provides a national-level assessment of employment and unemployment indicators, encompassing both rural and urban areas.  The survey's broad scope is essential for obtaining a complete picture of India's labour market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PLFS data for 2023 indicates an unemployment rate of 3.1%, which is *lower* than the global average of 5.1%. This difference is significant and highlights the contrast between India's and the global labour market performance.

Statement 3 is correct. The PLFS data is a critical resource for policymakers in formulating and evaluating employment-related policies.  The insights from the PLFS inform evidence-based policymaking, contributing to more effective interventions in the labour market.


**8. With reference to  the  Jute Corporation of India (JCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The JCI was established in 1971 primarily to promote the export of jute products.
2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the exclusive use of jute packaging for all commodities.
3. JCI's Jute I-CARE project focuses on mechanization in jute farming and improved retting techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JCI was established as a *price support agency*, not primarily to promote exports. Although exports are a part of the jute industry, the JCI's core function is to ensure fair prices for jute farmers and stabilize the domestic market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1987 Act mandates the *compulsory use* of jute packaging for *certain* commodities, not *all*.  The specific commodities covered under the Act are defined within the legislation itself, showing that the mandate is not absolute.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the Jute I-CARE project aims at mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting using microbial consortium.  This demonstrates the JCI's commitment to improving jute cultivation practices through technological advancements and sustainable methods.


**9. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFIS was launched in 2016-17 to assess the financial inclusion of urban populations in India.
2. The NAFINDEX is a measure of financial inclusion derived from data collected through NAFIS.
3. The second NAFIS provides insights into changes in rural financial inclusion indicators since 2016-17.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS is explicitly focused on the *rural* population, not urban populations. Its objective is to understand the financial inclusion status of rural communities across various parameters.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions that NAFINDEX is a measure of financial inclusion based on NAFIS data.  This indicates a direct relationship between the survey and the index used to quantify financial inclusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The second NAFIS aims to provide insights into changes in rural financial inclusion indicators since the first survey in 2016-17.  The comparative aspect allows for tracking progress and identifying areas needing further attention in promoting rural financial inclusion.


**10. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS.
3. PACS are the primary level institutions within the short-term cooperative credit structure in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  Therefore, they are not directly regulated by the RBI.  This distinction is important in understanding the regulatory framework governing PACS.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that one of the most important functions of DCCBs is to provide funds to PACS. This highlights the interconnectedness of these institutions within the cooperative credit structure.

Statement 3 is correct. PACS are indeed the grassroots-level institutions within the short-term cooperative credit structure in rural areas.  Their role in providing credit access at the village level is crucial for rural development and agricultural activities.


**11. With reference to the Indian technical textiles market, consider the following statements:**

1. India's technical textiles market is currently the largest in the world.
2. The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as a global leader in technical textiles.
3.  The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles is exclusively focused on promoting the production of cotton textiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India's technical textiles market is the *fifth* largest in the world, not the largest.  This factual accuracy is essential for understanding India's position in the global technical textiles landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Technical Textiles Mission's explicit goal is to position India as a global leader in this sector.  This ambitious target reflects the government's commitment to promoting the growth of the technical textiles industry.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PLI scheme for textiles is not limited to cotton textiles.  It aims to promote the production of various textiles, including technical textiles, thus supporting a broader range of textile manufacturing activities.  The scope of the PLI scheme is wider than just cotton.


**12. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI includes all manufacturing industries in India.
2. Petroleum refinery products have the highest weight in the ICI calculation.
3.  The ICI is released by the Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ICI only measures the combined and individual performance of production in *eight core industries*.  It is not an all-encompassing index for all manufacturing industries in India.  The limited scope of the ICI is important to understand its specific application.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that petroleum refinery products have the highest weight (28.04%) in the ICI calculation.  This weighting reflects the significant contribution of this sector to overall industrial production.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ICI is released by the *Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry*, not the Ministry of Finance.  This distinction is crucial in understanding the institutional responsibility for data dissemination and policy implications.


**1. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The TRIPS Agreement mandates that member countries must grant intellectual property rights for a minimum period of 20 years from the date of filing the application.
2.  The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement explicitly permits members to use compulsory licensing to address public health crises, even if it means overriding patent protection.
3. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the WIPO's Paris Convention but not from the Berne Convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for intellectual property protection, it doesn't specify a uniform 20-year period for all types of intellectual property. The duration varies depending on the type of IP right (patents, copyrights, etc.) and the specific provisions of the member country's national laws.  The minimum protection periods are defined within the agreement itself, and these vary depending on the type of intellectual property.

Statement 2 is correct. The Doha Declaration explicitly affirms that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health.  It explicitly allows for flexibilities, including compulsory licensing, to ensure access to essential medicines and technologies, even if it means overriding patent protection in certain circumstances. This is particularly crucial for developing countries facing public health challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement explicitly incorporates provisions from both the WIPO's Paris Convention (relating to industrial property) and the Berne Convention (relating to literary and artistic works).  These conventions provide a foundation for the minimum standards of protection required under the TRIPS Agreement.


**2. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF in India consistently remained above 25% of GDP from the 1980s until the present day.
2.  A decline in private investment, reflected in a fall in GFCF as a percentage of GDP, has been a significant challenge for the Indian economy since the early 2010s.
3.  GFCF, also known as investment, remained relatively stagnant around 5% of GDP from independence until economic liberalization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF did rise significantly to around 27% of GDP in 2007-08, it did not consistently remain above 25% from the 1980s.  In fact, from 2011-12 onwards, private investment (a major component of GFCF) began to decline, falling to a low of 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21 before rising again. This fluctuation demonstrates the inconsistency in maintaining GFCF above 25% of GDP.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly highlights the sluggish growth and decline in private GFCF as a significant challenge for the Indian economy, particularly from the early 2010s onwards. This decline indicates a slowdown in domestic investment and has implications for overall economic growth.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage states that investment remained slightly below or above 10% of GDP from independence to economic liberalization, not around 5%. This period saw relatively low levels of investment compared to the subsequent period of higher growth.


**3. With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1.  The framework's two-pillar approach focuses solely on reallocating profits of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to market jurisdictions.
2.  The framework aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 20% for MNEs.
3.  India is not a participating member of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The two-pillar approach of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS comprises two key elements: Pillar One, which focuses on reallocating a share of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs to market jurisdictions where their customers are located, and Pillar Two, which introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate.  It is not solely focused on profit reallocation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The framework aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, not 20%, for MNEs. This minimum tax rate aims to prevent tax avoidance by ensuring that MNEs pay a minimum level of tax regardless of where they choose to book their profits.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is a global initiative that brings together 147 countries and jurisdictions, *including India*, to combat tax avoidance.  India's active participation is a key fact.


**4. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement allows for unlimited subsidies for fishing activities within a country's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
2.  The agreement has already come into effect, with all WTO members fully complying with its provisions.
3. The agreement aims to curb harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of the world's fish stocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies focuses on curbing harmful subsidies, and while it may allow for certain exceptions, it does not permit unlimited subsidies for fishing within a country's EEZ.  The agreement aims to promote sustainable fishing practices and prevent overfishing.  Specific provisions address subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement requires acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members to come into effect, and as of December 2024, it was still short of the required number of ratifications.  Therefore, it has not yet fully come into effect, and not all members are in compliance.

Statement 3 is correct. The primary objective of the agreement is to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and the depletion of fish stocks.  This is a crucial aspect of promoting sustainable fisheries management and ensuring the long-term health of marine ecosystems.


**5. With reference to Duty Drawback, consider the following statements:**

1. Duty Drawback is a scheme under the Customs Act of 1962 that rebates excise duty on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods.
2. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) electronically disburses duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts.
3.  Duty Drawback aims to increase the cost of exports for Indian businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Duty Drawback, under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, rebates *customs* duty (not excise duty) on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods.  The scheme aims to offset the cost burden on exporters related to import duties paid on inputs used for producing export-oriented goods.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage specifically mentions that the CBIC now electronically disburses duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts using the Public Finance Management System, improving efficiency and transparency.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Duty Drawback aims to *reduce* the cost of exports for Indian businesses by reimbursing the customs duties paid on imported inputs. This makes Indian exports more competitive in the global market.


**6. With reference to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP targets ₹10 lakh crore of investment over four years (FY22 to FY25).
2.  The NMP focuses solely on monetising brownfield assets in the energy sector.
3.  The NMP involves licensing or leasing government-owned assets to private entities for a specified period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore of investment over four years (FY22 to FY25), not ₹10 lakh crore. This is a significant target, aiming to unlock the value of public assets and attract private investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the energy sector is included in the NMP, it does not focus solely on this sector.  The NMP identifies 13 sectors for monetization, including roads, railways, power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom, among others.  The scope is much broader than just the energy sector.

Statement 3 is correct. The NMP involves the process of asset monetization, which includes licensing or leasing government-owned assets to private entities for a specified period in exchange for payments.  This method allows the government to generate revenue while the private sector manages and operates the assets.


**7. With reference to the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP), consider the following statements:**

1. MAP is used primarily to resolve disputes related to Goods and Services Tax (GST).
2. MAP is a mechanism established under tax treaties to resolve double taxation disputes.
3.  MAP is a proactive measure to prevent transfer pricing disputes before they arise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MAP is primarily used to resolve disputes related to *double taxation* arising from international tax treaties (like DTAA), not GST.  GST is a domestic tax system, and MAP's focus is on cross-border tax issues.

Statement 2 is correct. MAP is a mechanism explicitly laid down in tax treaties to provide an avenue for resolving double taxation disputes, either juridical or economic in nature. This allows taxpayers an alternative dispute resolution mechanism to avoid double taxation in different countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MAP is a *reactive* measure, used to resolve *existing* double taxation disputes.  Advanced Pricing Agreements (APAs) are the proactive mechanisms designed to prevent transfer pricing disputes before they occur.  MAP deals with resolving existing disputes.


**8. With reference to the  Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, consider the following statements:**

1.  FVCIs can only invest in Indian companies listed on major stock exchanges.
2.  SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, govern the investments of FVCIs in India.
3.  FVCIs are required to invest only in sectors approved by the Reserve Bank of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FVCIs invest in venture capital funds registered with SEBI or in venture capital undertakings in India that are *not* listed on major stock exchanges.  The focus is on high-growth, unlisted companies.

Statement 2 is correct. The SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, specifically govern the investments made by Foreign Venture Capital Investors in India.  These regulations lay down the eligibility criteria, investment limits, and reporting requirements for FVCIs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While there might be sectoral regulations or restrictions applicable to foreign investment in general, FVCIs are not specifically required to invest only in sectors approved by the RBI. The investment choices of FVCIs are guided by the SEBI regulations and market opportunities.  The RBI's role is primarily in regulating foreign exchange transactions.


**9. With reference to the Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF), consider the following statements:**

1. VGF provides 100% of project costs as a capital grant.
2. VGF aims to enhance project viability by providing financial assistance.
3. VGF is exclusively for projects in the renewable energy sector.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. VGF provides *up to 40%* of project costs as a capital grant, not 100%. This partial funding is strategically designed to bridge the gap between the private sector's willingness to invest and the overall project cost, making the project financially viable.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary aim of VGF is to enhance the viability of projects by providing financial assistance. By partially covering project costs, VGF reduces the risk for private investors and encourages participation in projects that might otherwise be considered too risky or unprofitable.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While VGF might be used for projects in the renewable energy sector, it is not exclusively limited to this sector.  It can be applied to various infrastructure projects that are considered to be in public interest but may face viability challenges due to high initial investment costs or uncertain returns.


**1. With reference to India's trade deficit, consider the following statements:**

1. A widening current account deficit invariably leads to a sharp decline in the domestic currency's value against major global currencies.
2.  Increased imports of capital goods always contribute positively to a nation's long-term economic growth, irrespective of the trade deficit.
3. The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme aims to enhance India's export competitiveness by providing refunds for central, state, and local level taxes and levies on exported goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while a widening current account deficit can put downward pressure on a currency, the extent of depreciation depends on various factors including foreign exchange reserves, capital flows, and market sentiment.  A large trade deficit doesn't automatically translate to a sharp decline.  Other factors influencing exchange rates include speculation, government interventions, and global economic conditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect because while imports of capital goods can boost long-term growth by increasing productivity and improving infrastructure, a large trade deficit due to excessive capital goods imports can strain a nation's foreign exchange reserves and potentially hinder economic stability. The net effect on growth depends on the balance between the benefits of investment and the costs of the trade deficit.

Statement 3 is correct. The RoDTEP scheme is designed to neutralize indirect taxes levied on exported goods, making Indian products more price-competitive in the international market. This directly addresses the issue of export competitiveness.  It replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) to streamline the process and enhance transparency.


**2. With reference to initiatives promoting exports and foreign investment in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Trade Connect e-Platform, a single-window initiative, primarily assists large multinational corporations in navigating international trade regulations.
2. The Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) was established in 1963 as a private sector initiative to promote international business education.
3. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows into India are solely determined by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Trade Connect e-Platform is designed to facilitate international trade for Indian exporters, particularly Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).  It provides real-time access to crucial trade-related information, simplifying the export process.  Large corporations, while also benefiting, are not the primary target.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IIFT was established in 1963 as an autonomous body under the Ministry of Commerce.  It is a public institution, not a private sector initiative.  Its focus is on foreign trade and international business research, training, and education, making it a key player in shaping India's trade policies and practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While DPIIT plays a crucial role in formulating FDI policy, FDI inflows are influenced by numerous factors beyond DPIIT's direct control. These include global economic conditions, investor sentiment, domestic policy environment, and ease of doing business.  Therefore, DPIIT is not the sole determinant of FDI.


**3. With reference to Project Nexus and cross-border payments, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus aims to interconnect domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across all G20 nations by 2026.
2. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the conceptualizer of Project Nexus, is a private financial institution headquartered in London, England.
3. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India serves as an example of a domestic Instant Payment System (IPS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus initially connects the IPS of four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and India.  Expansion to all G20 nations is a potential future goal but not the initial objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BIS is an international organization owned by 63 central banks, including the RBI. Its headquarters is in Basel, Switzerland, not London.  The BIS focuses on fostering international monetary and financial cooperation.

Statement 3 is correct.  UPI, developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), is a prime example of an IPS, enabling instant inter-bank fund transfers within India. It is a crucial component of India's digital payments infrastructure.



**4. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs), consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI's (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, mandate that all investments by FVCIs in Indian companies must be made through the government route, requiring prior approval.
2. A Venture Capital Fund (VCF) registered with SEBI invests solely in companies listed on major Indian stock exchanges.
3.  The SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2024, amended the existing 2000 regulations to enhance the regulatory framework for FVCIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI is permitted through both the automatic route (no government approval needed) and the government route (approval required).  SEBI regulations do not mandate that all FVCIs must use the government route.

Statement 2 is incorrect. VCFs registered with SEBI invest in high-risk, high-return ventures, which often includes unlisted companies.  Their investments are not limited to companies listed on stock exchanges.  The aim is to support early-stage businesses with high growth potential.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2024 amendments to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations updated the existing regulations to address evolving market conditions and investor needs.  These amendments likely aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulatory framework for FVCIs.


**5. With reference to India Stack and its global advancement, consider the following statements:**

1.  India Stack is a proprietary technology platform developed by a private consortium of Indian technology companies.
2. The One Future Alliance initiative focuses solely on providing financial aid to low and middle-income countries for implementing DPI.
3. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) is intended to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices related to Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India Stack is an open-source digital public infrastructure (DPI) initiative developed by the Indian government.  It is not proprietary and is designed to be adaptable and scalable for various applications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The One Future Alliance aims to build capacity, provide technical assistance, and offer funding support for implementing DPI in low and middle-income countries.  While funding is a component, it is not the sole focus; capacity building and technical assistance are equally important.

Statement 3 is correct.  The GDPIR's primary goal is to create a centralized repository for DPI-related information, facilitating knowledge sharing and collaboration among countries.  This promotes best practices and avoids duplication of efforts in implementing DPI globally.


**6. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and its internationalization, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a government-owned entity established under the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  The internationalization of UPI is solely driven by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) without any involvement from private entities.
3.  NIPL's partnership with Trinidad and Tobago signifies an effort to expand the reach of UPI beyond India's borders.

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the data provided in the text, stating that India accounts for nearly 80% of Asia's and 20% of global millet production. This highlights India's significant role in the global millet market.  However, it also suggests the potential for increased production and market expansion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text does mention a shift in consumer preferences and MSP-backed procurement schemes for fine cereals as factors contributing to stagnant millet production, it does *not* state a complete lack of MSP-backed procurement schemes for millets. The statement overstates the impact of consumer preferences and misrepresents the reality of government support mechanisms for millets.  The exaggeration serves as a key distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect and presents a complete opposite of the reality. The text explicitly states that millets are a good source of minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium, and have a low Glycemic Index (good for preventing diabetes).  This is a crucial nutritional benefit often overlooked, and the contrasting information effectively misleads candidates. The complete reversal of the nutritional facts is a powerful distractor.


**3. With reference to household savings in India, consider the following statements:**

3.  The Indian household sector typically invests all its surplus savings internally, rarely lending excess funds to other sectors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly categorizes household savings into financial and physical components. The text clearly defines financial savings as encompassing currency, deposits, and life insurance funds, and physical savings as including physical assets, gold, and silver. This distinction is fundamental to understanding the structure of household savings and their impact on the economy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text directly states that a decline in financial savings poses challenges for the banking sector in maintaining liquidity and managing credit risk. This highlights the crucial role of household savings in the stability of the financial system.  The statement accurately reflects the interlinkage between household savings and the banking sector's health.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the Indian household sector typically generates *surplus* savings relative to its investments, and it *lends* this excess to other sectors.  This contradicts the statement, emphasizing the role of the household sector as a net lender in the Indian economy. The opposite assertion serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the household sector's role in financial flows.


**4. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council has established a Group of Ministers (GoM) to determine the taxation of luxury, sin, and demerit goods after the compensation cess ends in March 2026.

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the GST Council has indeed formed a GoM to decide on the taxation of these goods after the compensation cess expires. This highlights the ongoing challenges in GST implementation and the need for future policy adjustments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GST (Compensation to States) Act did levy a compensation cess, the text explicitly states that the cess was levied at *varied* rates on luxury, sin, and demerit goods, not at a uniform rate. The incorrect information regarding a uniform rate acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text classifies SUVs as *luxury* goods, not demerit goods.  The subtle distinction between luxury and demerit goods is important for understanding the rationale behind taxation policies.  The misclassification of SUVs effectively tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of GST classifications.  The incorrect categorization of SUVs is designed to be a plausible distractor.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The EIF is indeed a multilateral partnership, not bilateral, dedicated to helping LDCs leverage trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  Statement 1 is partially correct in its description of the EIF's objective but incorrect in classifying it as a bilateral partnership. Statement 3 is accurate; the WTO is a key supporter of the EIF.  Crucially, statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the UNDP.  The UNDP is involved in development work globally, but it does not manage the EIF's trust fund.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN was established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas using funds generated through a levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of telecom licensees.

3. The Telecommunications (Administration of Digital Bharat Nidhi) Rules, 2024, were notified by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to operationalize the DBN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DBN was indeed established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, to fund telecom initiatives in underserved regions.  It utilizes a levy (Universal Access Levy) on the AGR of telecom licensees. Statement 3 is also correct; the DoT notified the rules to make the DBN functional. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The USOF, which the DBN replaced, was funded by a levy on the license fee charged to DoT licensees, calculated as 5% of their AGR, not their net profit. This is a key distinction that highlights the difference in funding mechanisms between the USOF and DBN.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE is a non-profit organization established under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.
2. The creation of the NCoE was proposed in the 2022-23 budget and is provisionally named the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).
3. The NCoE will focus solely on the development of animation and visual effects technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The 2022-23 budget did propose the NCoE, and the provisional name is indeed the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE is established as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, not a non-profit organization under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.  This is a crucial distinction concerning its legal structure.  Furthermore, statement 3 is also incorrect.  While animation and visual effects are components, the NCoE's scope encompasses gaming, comics, and extended reality (XR) technologies, making it broader than just animation and visual effects. Consequently, only statement 2 is correct.


**4.  With reference to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)'s role in transforming the insurance sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  Insurance penetration in India increased from 2.71% in 2001-02 to 4.2% in 2021-22, primarily due to IRDAI's initiatives to promote microinsurance.
2. IRDAI aims to achieve "Insurance for All" by 2047, ensuring every citizen has appropriate insurance coverage.
3.  The IRDAI introduced stricter regulations on Designated Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) to mitigate systemic risks but exempted them from additional capital requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects IRDAI's stated goal of providing insurance coverage to all citizens by 2047.  However, statement 1, while showing correct figures for insurance penetration, is misleading. While IRDAI has played a role, attributing the increase solely to its microinsurance initiatives is an oversimplification.  Other factors, such as economic growth and increased awareness, also contributed.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  D-SIIs are indeed subject to additional regulatory measures to mitigate systemic risk, and these often *do* include higher capital requirements to enhance their resilience. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the World Bank's Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The B-Ready Index replaces the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings, which were discontinued due to data manipulation concerns.
2. The B-Ready Index includes a comprehensive assessment of all 193 member countries of the United Nations.
3. The B-Ready Index's rollout spans three years (2024-2026) and focuses on areas like reform advocacy and policy guidance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the B-Ready Index replaced the EoDB due to data irregularities. Statement 3 accurately describes the index's three-year rollout and its focus on reform advocacy and policy guidance.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The initial assessment of the B-Ready Index does *not* include all 193 UN member countries; it started with a smaller subset of 50 economies (excluding India).  This is a significant limitation of the index's initial scope. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.



**6. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional loans at below-market interest rates to low-income countries.
2. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) offers concessional financial support tailored to the needs of low-income countries.
3. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) primarily focuses on providing short-term financing to high-income countries facing economic crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GRA provides loans on non-concessional terms (market-based interest rates), not concessional loans.  Statement 2 is correct; the PRGT does offer concessional support specifically designed for low-income countries. Statement 3 is incorrect. The RST provides longer-term financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to build resilience against external shocks, not short-term financing to high-income countries.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $10 billion by 2030.
2. The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and expertise from various World Bank Group institutions under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
3. The WBG-GP primarily provides guarantees for loans to the public sector for infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP aims to *increase*, not reduce, the annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030.  Statement 2 is correct; the platform does consolidate guarantee offerings and expertise under MIGA. Statement 3 is incorrect. While it does provide guarantees for public sector loans, it also covers private sector projects and public-private partnerships. The platform's scope is broader than just public sector loans.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across education, health, and economic opportunities.
2. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the loss in HDI due to inequality across various dimensions.
3. The Planetary Pressures-adjusted Human Development Index adjusts the HDI to account for greenhouse gas emissions but not for resource depletion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct; the GII does consider reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation – all aspects relating to education, health, and economic opportunities. Statement 2 is also correct; the IHDI does indeed account for the loss in HDI due to inequalities.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the planetary pressures-adjusted HDI considers environmental sustainability, it accounts for a broader range of planetary pressures than just greenhouse gas emissions; resource depletion is also factored in. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate.


**9. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 MPI report was published solely by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).
2. The report indicates that approximately 1.1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
3.  India had the second-largest number of people in extreme poverty according to the 2024 MPI report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report was a joint publication of the UNDP and OPHI, not solely by OPHI. Statement 2 is correct; the report did find approximately 1.1 billion people in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries. Statement 3 is incorrect.  India had the *largest*, not the second-largest, number of people in extreme poverty according to the report (234 million).  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**10. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing only for pharmaceutical products.
2. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.
3. India became a member of the WTO and ratified the TRIPS Agreement in 1995.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing for a broader range of products and processes than just pharmaceuticals; it's a more general provision. Statement 2 is correct; the TRIPS Agreement does incorporate elements from the WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions. Statement 3 is largely correct, although the phrasing is slightly ambiguous. India joined the WTO in 1995 and, as a member, accepted the TRIPS Agreement. While the exact date of ratification might vary slightly depending on the specific interpretation of "ratified," the overall timeline is accurate. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are considered correct.



**11. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF as a percentage of GDP in India consistently remained above 25% from independence until economic liberalization.
2.  Private investment, as a component of GFCF, experienced a significant decline from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a low of approximately 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21.
3.  Net Capital Formation (NCF) is calculated by subtracting depreciation from Gross Capital Formation (GCF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GFCF as a percentage of GDP fluctuated around 10% before economic liberalization; it did not consistently remain above 25%. Statement 2 is correct. Private investment did decline significantly from 2011-12, reaching the low point mentioned. Statement 3 is also correct; NCF is indeed calculated by deducting depreciation from GCF.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**12. With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1. The AoA mandates the complete elimination of all export subsidies by all WTO members.
2. The AoA's "Peace Clause" provides a permanent solution for public stockholding for food security purposes.
3. The AoA's "tariffication" process involves converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the AoA aims to reduce export subsidies, it hasn't mandated complete elimination by all members; there are exceptions and timelines involved. Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Peace Clause" provides only a *temporary* solution, not a permanent one, regarding public stockholding. Statement 3 is correct; tariffication under the AoA does involve converting non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**13. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement aims to eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies to protect fish stocks.
2. The Agreement includes a special and differential treatment (S&DT) provision for developing countries.
3. India is among the countries that have ratified the Agreement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Agreement targets *harmful* fisheries subsidies, not all subsidies. The aim is to curb those that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks, not a complete ban on all subsidies. Statement 2 is correct; the Agreement does include S&DT for developing countries. Statement 3 is incorrect.  As of December 2024, the Agreement hasn't been ratified by enough countries to come into force, and India is not among those that have ratified it.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**14. With reference to measures by the Indian government to protect Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Genetic Resources (GRs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is primarily aimed at preventing biopiracy and wrongful patents on TK.
2. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, provides for the protection of plant varieties but does not address the issue of TK.
3. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge related to specific geographical regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the TKDL's main purpose is to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, *does* indirectly address TK by protecting farmers' rights over their traditional plant varieties and associated knowledge. Statement 3 is also correct; the Geographical Indications Act does protect traditional knowledge linked to specific geographical areas.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully accurate.


**15. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMGS NMP is based on a closed-source technology platform hosted on a private cloud server.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP uses an *open-source* technology platform hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud. Statement 2 is correct; the plan integrates data from various ministries, including those associated with Bharatmala and Sagarmala. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP utilizes satellite imagery primarily from ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), not NASA or the European Space Agency.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**16. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising government assets, focusing on infrastructure projects.
2. The Private Investment Board under the Ministry of Finance is the primary body responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
3. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state-level PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NMP does aim to generate investment by monetising government assets, although the focus is broader than just infrastructure. Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary body responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs is the Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs, not a board under the Ministry of Finance. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee primarily evaluates *central* sector PPP projects, not both central and state-level projects.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**17. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) and the Intellectual Property (IP) Index, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GII and IP Index are identical ranking systems that assess a country's innovation capabilities.
2. India's rank in the IP Index is consistently higher than its rank in the GII.
3. The IP Index assesses aspects of a country's intellectual property protection and enforcement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII and IP Index are distinct ranking systems, although both relate to innovation.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text gives an example where India's rank in the IP Index was lower than its rank in the GII (42 out of 55 vs 40 out of 132), indicating that the relationship between the rankings is not consistently one of superiority for the IP Index. Statement 3 is correct. The IP Index does assess intellectual property protection and enforcement within a country. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**18. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty is legally binding on all member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
2. The treaty aims to enhance the efficacy and transparency of patent systems globally.
3. The treaty was adopted without the participation of any developing countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the treaty is adopted by WIPO, it becomes legally binding only after ratification by a sufficient number of parties (15). It is not automatically binding on all WIPO members. Statement 2 is correct; enhancing patent system efficacy and transparency is a key aim of the treaty. Statement 3 is incorrect. The treaty was adopted by consensus among more than 150 countries, including many developing countries. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.



**1. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tariffication, a key component of Market Access under the Agreement, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.  However, it allows for the continued use of certain quantitative restrictions under specific circumstances.
2.  The "Peace Clause," adopted at the 9th Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali, provides a temporary solution regarding public stockholding (PSH) for food security, but doesn't address the concerns of developed countries regarding market distortion.
3.  Developed and developing countries agreed to eliminate export subsidies as per the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015, except for certain specified agricultural products deemed essential for food security in developing countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  Tariffication does indeed aim to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs, but the statement incorrectly implies an absolute abolishment of all non-tariff barriers.  The Agreement allows for exceptions under specific conditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Peace Clause" is indeed an interim solution, but the statement misrepresents its scope. It doesn't specifically ignore developed countries' concerns; rather, it's a temporary measure to allow developing countries to maintain their PSH programs without facing immediate WTO challenges.  The issue of market distortion remains a point of contention.

Statement 3 is largely correct. The Nairobi Ministerial Decision did lead to the elimination of export subsidies, but the statement needs clarification. The elimination wasn't absolute and exceptions were made to accommodate the food security needs of developing nations.  This nuance makes the statement more accurate than it would be otherwise.


**2. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement, adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in 2022, aims to eliminate all subsidies related to fishing activities, regardless of their impact on fish stocks.
2.  Developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) were granted a 5-year transition period to comply with the Agreement's provisions on curbing harmful subsidies.
3.  India's stance on the Agreement emphasizes the "polluter pays principle" and "common but differentiated responsibilities," advocating for greater responsibility from countries historically responsible for fish stock depletion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Package aims to curb *harmful* subsidies, not all subsidies related to fishing.  The distinction is crucial; subsidies that support sustainable fishing practices are not targeted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The transition period granted to developing and LDCs was 2 years, not 5. This factual inaccuracy makes the statement entirely false.

Statement 3 is correct. India's position accurately reflects the principles of "polluter pays" and "common but differentiated responsibilities," highlighting the historical context of overfishing and advocating for a more equitable approach to addressing the issue.


**3. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement, established as part of the Uruguay Round, came into force in 2000 and sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.
2.  The Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, enabling countries to produce patented products without the patent owner's consent under certain circumstances, primarily benefiting developed nations.
3. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement clarifies that the Agreement does not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health, even if it involves utilizing flexibilities within the Agreement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement came into force in 1995, not 2000. This significant chronological error renders the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Compulsory licensing primarily benefits developing and underdeveloped countries, not developed nations.  Developed nations generally have the resources to negotiate licenses or develop alternative technologies.

Statement 3 is correct. The Doha Declaration explicitly affirms that the TRIPS Agreement does not impede members' ability to protect public health, thereby allowing for the use of flexibilities within the Agreement to achieve this goal.


**4. With reference to Public Stockholding (PSH) policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PSH policy enables governments to procure crops from farmers at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), store them, and distribute them to the poor, thereby minimizing market price fluctuations.
2.  Developing countries advocate for an increase in the de minimis limit (currently 10% for developing countries and 5% for developed countries) and amendments to the formula used to calculate price support subsidies.
3.  Most developed countries contend that PSH policies, while aiming to enhance food security, lead to excessive market distortions and should be entirely prohibited, regardless of their social benefits.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PSH policy functions as described, aiming to provide a safety net for farmers and ensure food availability for vulnerable populations.  The statement accurately reflects the policy's core objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. Developing countries' demands for increased de minimis limits and formula amendments are well-documented in WTO negotiations.  These demands reflect the need for greater flexibility in supporting their agricultural sectors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While developed countries express concerns about market distortions caused by PSH,  they don't advocate for a complete prohibition. The statement oversimplifies their position, which is more nuanced and involves seeking limitations and modifications rather than an outright ban.  They prefer mechanisms that minimize market distortions while allowing for food security initiatives.


**5. With reference to the Marrakesh Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. Signed in 1994, the Marrakesh Agreement established the WTO, replacing the GATT, and broadened the scope of trade agreements to include services and intellectual property.
2. The Agreement, signed by 150 countries, laid the foundation for a modern multilateral trading system encompassing negotiations, dispute resolution, and economic cooperation among member nations.
3.  The Agreement's 30th anniversary was commemorated in 2024, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of global trade governance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement did indeed establish the WTO, replacing the GATT, and significantly expanded the scope of trade agreements to include services and intellectual property rights (IPR).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Agreement did lay the foundation for a modern multilateral trading system, the number of signatory countries is incorrectly stated. The text specifies 123 countries, not 150. This factual inaccuracy makes the statement wrong.

Statement 3 is correct.  The 30th anniversary of the Marrakesh Agreement was indeed commemorated in 2024, marking a significant point in the history of global trade regulation.


**1. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is primarily responsible for overseeing the policy aspects of PPP projects at the central government level.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates all PPP projects, regardless of whether they are central or state-level initiatives.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to attract private investment by leveraging existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over a four-year period (FY22-FY25).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in shaping the policy environment for PPPs at the central level.  It doesn't directly handle individual project implementation, but its policies significantly influence the overall PPP landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, it does not have jurisdiction over state-level initiatives.  State governments have their own mechanisms for appraising and approving PPP projects.  The question attempts to mislead by suggesting a centralized appraisal system for all PPPs.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative aimed at attracting private investment through the monetization of government assets.  The ₹6.0 lakh crore target over four years (FY22-FY25) reflects the scale of this ambitious program. The question uses a precise financial figure to test accurate recall.


**2. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is the minimum price at which the government purchases all agricultural produce from farmers, ensuring complete market protection.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends the MSP, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency responsible for purchasing all MSP-covered crops nationwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MSP aims to prevent distress selling, it doesn't guarantee that the government will purchase *all* agricultural produce at that price. The government's procurement is often based on availability, storage capacity, and market demand. The statement oversimplifies the complexities of MSP implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The CACP plays a crucial advisory role in recommending MSPs, but the final authority rests with the CCEA, reflecting the political and economic considerations involved in setting these prices.  The question highlights the division of responsibilities between the advisory body and the decision-making body.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FCI is a major procuring agency, primarily for wheat and paddy, but other agencies at the state and central levels also participate in MSP procurement. The statement falsely presents the FCI as the only entity involved in procurement.


**3. With reference to India’s Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agricultural Export Policy, implemented in 2018, aimed to achieve agricultural export earnings of $60 billion by 2023.
2. A significant decline in agricultural exports was registered in 2023-24, falling short of the ambitious target set by the 2018 policy.
3. The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was primarily attributed to unfavorable global market conditions and a surge in domestic demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target year mentioned in the provided text is 2022, not 2023.  This subtle change makes the statement factually inaccurate.


Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that agricultural exports in 2023-24 fell short of the $60 billion target set for 2022. This statement directly reflects the information provided.


Statement 3 is partially correct but lacks precise details. While global market conditions and domestic demand likely played a role, the statement doesn't provide sufficient information to determine their precise impact on the export decline.  Other factors could also have contributed, making the statement an oversimplification.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between a partially true statement and a fully accurate one.


**4. With reference to the “Middle Income Trap”, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank coined the term “middle-income trap” in 2007 to describe economies that stagnate at middle-income levels and fail to transition to high-income status.
2.  According to the World Bank, countries classified as Middle Income Countries (MICs) have a per capita Gross National Income (GNI) ranging from US$1,135 to US$13,846.
3. The World Bank's “World Development Report 2024” suggests that escaping the middle-income trap requires a three-pronged approach: Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation, with creative destruction playing a crucial role in this transition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information presented in the provided text regarding the "Middle Income Trap".  The question tests factual recall of definitions, classifications, and policy recommendations by the World Bank.  There are no misleading elements or subtle inaccuracies in the statements.


**5. With reference to the Preston Curve, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Preston Curve, initially proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975, demonstrates a consistent linear relationship between per capita income and life expectancy across all levels of economic development.
2. The curve illustrates that in poor countries, initial increases in per capita income lead to significant improvements in life expectancy due to factors like improved nutrition and healthcare access.
3.  The Preston Curve suggests that beyond a certain point, further increases in per capita income have a diminishing impact on life expectancy, indicating that other factors become more important determinants of health outcomes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preston Curve does *not* show a consistent linear relationship. Its key characteristic is the flattening of the curve at higher income levels, indicating diminishing returns on life expectancy as income rises beyond a certain point. The question uses this non-linearity to create a distractor.


Statement 2 is correct. The initial phase of the curve shows a strong positive correlation between income and life expectancy in poorer countries, reflecting the impact of improved nutrition, sanitation, and healthcare.


Statement 3 is correct.  The flattening of the curve highlights that other factors, beyond income, such as environmental conditions, lifestyle choices, and access to advanced medical care, play a more significant role in determining life expectancy at higher income levels.  The statement accurately captures the essence of the Preston Curve's non-linearity.


**6. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Global MPI report, jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI, indicates that approximately 1.1 billion people globally live in acute multidimensional poverty.
2.  India had the highest number of people living in extreme poverty according to the 2024 MPI report, surpassing all other countries.
3. The MPI is a poverty measure that solely focuses on income levels, providing a unidimensional perspective on poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the 2024 MPI report indicates approximately 1.1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that India had the largest number of people living in extreme poverty according to the report.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MPI is specifically designed to be a *multidimensional* measure, considering factors beyond just income, such as education, health, and living standards. The statement presents a fundamentally incorrect understanding of the MPI's core concept.  The question uses this misconception as a significant distractor.



**7. With reference to India’s National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMPI was introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, using data primarily from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).
2. The NMPI includes all the indicators used in the global MPI, without any additions or modifications.
3. The NMPI value is calculated by multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), where 'H' represents the percentage of the population below the poverty line, and 'A' represents the average deprivation experienced by the multidimensionally poor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms that NITI Aayog introduced the NMPI in 2021 and utilized NFHS data for its calculation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions that the NMPI *added* two indicators (Maternal Health and Bank Account) to the original global MPI indicators. This addition differentiates the Indian NMPI from the global MPI.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the calculation method of the NMPI value using the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A).  The question tests the understanding of the specific mathematical calculation behind the index.


**8. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMY provides loans exclusively to women entrepreneurs in the micro, small, and medium enterprise (MSME) sector.
2. Loans under PMMY are categorized into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with the 2024 Union Budget increasing the maximum loan amount for the Tarun category to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus).
3. PMMY loans are collateral-free and are disbursed through commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMY is not exclusively for women entrepreneurs; it extends to all non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.  The statement incorrectly limits the scheme's beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the loan categories (Shishu, Kishore, Tarun) and the 2024 budget's increase in the Tarun loan limit.

Statement 3 is correct. The text confirms that PMMY loans are collateral-free and disbursed through commercial banks and NBFCs.


**9. With reference to the inheritance tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India currently levies an inheritance tax on the total value of a deceased person's estate, similar to estate tax systems in other countries like Japan and South Korea.
2.  Prior to its abolition in 1985, estate duty in India had a high tax rate, leading to its unpopularity.
3.  Gift tax, which was reintroduced in 2004, currently taxes gifts exceeding ₹50,000 in a financial year, with exceptions for donations, inheritance, and gifts from close relatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India currently does *not* levy an inheritance tax.  The statement contradicts the explicit statement in the text about the absence of inheritance tax in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the high tax rate of the estate duty and its subsequent abolition due to unpopularity.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly outlines the current gift tax regulations, including the threshold amount and specified exceptions.


**10. With reference to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is responsible for negotiating and finalizing APAs with Indian taxpayers.
2.  In FY 2023-24, the CBDT signed a record number of APAs, including both Unilateral and Bilateral agreements.
3. APAs are primarily designed to resolve transfer pricing disputes between multinational corporations and tax authorities in a proactive manner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CBDT is the primary authority in India responsible for handling APAs.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the record number of APAs signed by the CBDT in FY 2023-24.

Statement 3 is correct. APAs are indeed a mechanism for proactively addressing potential transfer pricing disputes, offering certainty to both taxpayers and tax authorities.

1. The GI Act, 1999, primarily protects the intellectual property rights of individual inventors and creators of new products.
2. The Act guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical locations.
3. UNESCO's recognition of Yoga as an Intangible Cultural Heritage is directly linked to the provisions of the GI Act, 1999.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GI Act, 1999, focuses on protecting geographical indications, which are signs used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin.  It's not about individual inventions but collective geographical identity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act's core purpose is to protect the collective rights of producers associated with specific geographical areas and their traditional knowledge.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While both relate to cultural heritage, UNESCO recognition operates under a different international framework than the Indian GI Act.  The question uses the connection between cultural heritage and geographical indication to test the understanding of the specific scope of the GI Act.


**12. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, launched in 2021, is primarily focused on developing India’s road infrastructure.
2. The plan integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, and UDAN.
3. The Digital Master Planning tool used to develop the PM GatiShakti plan utilizes open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India’s cloud), and incorporates ISRO satellite imagery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While road infrastructure is a component, PM GatiShakti has a broader scope encompassing railways, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure. The statement wrongly narrows down the plan's focus.

2.  Vadhvan Port is designed to be India's largest container port and one of its largest deep-water ports.
3. The development of Vadhvan Port is expected to significantly boost the economic activity in the surrounding region and improve connectivity for the state's trade and commerce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that Vadhvan Port will be the *13th* major port, not the 12th. This is a precise numerical detail that differentiates the correct answer from the distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions that Vadhvan Port is planned to be India's largest container port and one of its largest deep-water ports.

1. India is currently the world's largest producer of silk, contributing over 50% of the global silk production.
2. Karnataka is the leading silk-producing state in India, contributing more than 40% of the country's total silk production.
3. India produces all four major varieties of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that India is the *second* largest producer of silk, contributing 42% of global production.  The question uses an inflated percentage to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka is a major producer, the text indicates that it contributes around 32%, not more than 40%, of India's total silk production.  This is a precise numerical detail that tests the accuracy of fact recall.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text confirms that India produces all four varieties of silk mentioned.


**1. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable offshore mineral resources, including rare earth elements.
3. The Geological Survey of India has identified phosphorite deposits only in the Eastern continental margin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  This exclusion is crucial because these resources are often governed by separate legislation and regulatory frameworks.  The rules focus on other types of offshore minerals.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's EEZ, exceeding two million square kilometers, is known to hold substantial recoverable offshore mineral resources.  The text explicitly mentions the presence of gold, diamonds, copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and rare earth elements, highlighting the diversity and potential economic value of these reserves. The vast expanse of the EEZ increases the potential for further discoveries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Geological Survey of India has identified phosphorite deposits in both the Eastern and Western continental margins. This shows a wider geographical distribution of this mineral resource than stated in the statement, indicating a more extensive exploration effort.  The omission of the Western margin in the statement is a significant factual error.


**2. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project aims to reduce the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport.
2.  The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) and PM GatiShakti are initiatives aimed at improving logistics efficiency.
3. The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) with Russia allows for the exchange of military logistics and support facilities only during wartime.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DFC project's primary goal is to *increase* the share of rail freight traffic from 27% in 2019 to 45% by 2030. This is a key objective of the National Rail Plan 2030, aiming to improve the efficiency and capacity of India's rail network for freight transportation.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual aim.

Statement 2 is correct. Both LEEP and PM GatiShakti are explicitly mentioned as initiatives designed to enhance logistics efficiency in India.  PM GatiShakti, in particular, is a comprehensive national master plan focusing on multimodal connectivity and infrastructure development to improve the overall efficiency of logistics operations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  RELOS agreements, including the one with Russia, facilitate the exchange of logistics and support facilities in both wartime and peacetime. This is essential for joint military exercises, humanitarian aid, and other collaborative missions. Limiting the agreement to wartime scenarios misrepresents its scope and function.


**3. With reference to India's seaweed farming, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is not considered a part of aquaculture.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025.
3. The National Institute of Ocean Technology- Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI) has initiated offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Seaweed cultivation is explicitly mentioned as a component of aquaculture, which encompasses the farming of aquatic organisms.  The text clearly links seaweed farming to the aquaculture sector, which contributes to India's GDP. The statement contradicts this established fact.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has set an ambitious target of 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental potential of seaweed farming.  The statement accurately reflects the Yojana's objectives.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly states that NIOT-ACOSTI has begun offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region. This initiative represents a significant step towards expanding seaweed farming in India and exploring the potential of this sector.  The statement accurately reports on this ongoing project.

This indicates a considerable gap in steel consumption between India and other countries, highlighting the potential for future growth in the domestic market. The statement reverses the actual figures.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that India faces a significant challenge in securing sufficient coking coal, relying heavily on costly imports from Australia.  This dependence on imports poses a risk to the sector's stability and competitiveness. The statement accurately reflects this vulnerability.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India's major iron and steel exports to the EU are indeed threatened by the imposition of the EU's carbon tax, ranging from 19.8% to 52.7%. This tax directly impacts the competitiveness of Indian steel products in the EU market. The statement incorrectly suggests no impact.


**5. With reference to the inheritance tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Inheritance tax is currently levied in India and is similar to estate tax.
2. Estate duty, a precursor to inheritance tax, was abolished in India due to its low tax rate.
3.  Gift tax, abolished in 1998, was reintroduced in 2004 with an exemption for gifts exceeding Rs 50,000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India currently does *not* have an inheritance tax. The text clearly states that there is no such tax currently in place. The statement misrepresents the current tax regime.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Estate duty was abolished in India in 1985 because of its *high* tax rate (up to 85%), not because of a low rate. This high rate made it unpopular and ultimately led to its removal. The statement incorrectly cites the reason for its abolition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While gift tax was indeed reintroduced in 2004, the exemption is for gifts *below*, not exceeding, Rs 50,000.  Gifts above this amount are added to the recipient's income and taxed accordingly.  The statement incorrectly presents the exemption threshold.  There are also exceptions for donations, inheritance, gifts from close relatives, and wedding gifts.


**1. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The India Stack, a foundational DPI, comprises layers for identity, payments, and data governance, with examples including Aadhaar, UPI, and DigiLocker respectively.

2. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), under the National Rail Plan 2030, aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% (2019) to 45% (2030).
3. The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) with Russia primarily facilitates the exchange of civilian logistics and supply chain infrastructure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a multi-phased project, not a single-phase undertaking. The construction of approximately 65,000 km of National Highways is spread across two phases.

Statement 2 is correct. The DFCs are a key component of the National Rail Plan 2030, with the stated goal of significantly increasing the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport.

2. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, 2024, indicates that India has the lowest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty among the 112 countries surveyed.
3. The Preston Curve suggests that an increase in per capita income always leads to a directly proportional increase in life expectancy in all countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NITI Aayog report shows a decrease in the poverty headcount ratio, but it highlights that poorer states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Odisha recorded faster declines, indicating a reduction in disparities. The statement incorrectly claims faster decline in wealthier states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Global MPI report, 2024, while not providing exact rankings, states that India had the largest number (234 million) of people living in acute multidimensional poverty among the countries surveyed.  The statement contradicts this finding.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Preston Curve demonstrates that the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy is not always directly proportional.  While increased income initially leads to improved life expectancy due to factors like better nutrition and healthcare, the relationship plateaus beyond a certain point.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the curve's implications.


**6. With reference to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, increased the time limit for filing a request for patent examination from 48 months to 31 months.
2. The National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, 2016, aims to weaken India's commitment to the Doha Development Agenda and TRIPS Agreement to promote domestic industries.
3.  The Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge, adopted by WIPO, aims to enhance the efficacy and transparency of the patent system and prevent erroneous patent grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, actually *reduced* the time limit for filing a request for examination from 48 months to 31 months, not increased it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National IPR Policy, 2016, explicitly *reiterates* India's commitment to the Doha Development Agenda and the TRIPS Agreement.  The statement incorrectly suggests the opposite.

Statement 3 is correct. The WIPO treaty aims to improve the patent system's efficiency, transparency, and quality, preventing the erroneous granting of patents for inventions that lack novelty.  This aligns directly with the treaty's stated objectives.

2. The recent expansion of the AIF includes allowing convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for individual farmers only, excluding Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).
3. NABARD Sanrakshan, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NABARD, has been proposed to extend AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs, in addition to CGTMSE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹20 Crores, with a 3% per annum interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The recent expansion of the AIF allows convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM not just for individual farmers but also for groups of farmers, FPOs, cooperatives, and Panchayats.  The statement incorrectly restricts eligibility.

Statement 3 is correct. NABARD Sanrakshan has indeed been proposed to extend AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs alongside CGTMSE, broadening the scheme's reach and support for agricultural entities.

2.  The interest subvention under AIF is 5% per annum for loans exceeding ₹2 Crores.
3. The Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) provides credit guarantee coverage under AIF for loans up to ₹2 Crores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) is a medium-to-long-term debt financing facility, not short-term as stated in statement 1.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the interest subvention is actually 3% per annum, irrespective of loan amount.  Statement 3 is correct; the CGTMSE does indeed offer credit guarantee coverage for loans up to ₹2 Crores under the AIF scheme. This ensures reduced risk for lenders, encouraging greater participation in financing agricultural infrastructure projects.  The AIF aims to improve post-harvest management, reduce food wastage, and enhance the overall efficiency of the agricultural value chain.  The scheme's success hinges on its ability to attract private investment and streamline access to credit for farmers and entrepreneurs involved in agricultural infrastructure development.  The credit guarantee component plays a crucial role in mitigating risk and making the scheme more attractive to lenders.

1.  The global MPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) for its calculations.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI) includes indicators related to maternal health and bank accounts.
3.  The MPI is primarily focused on measuring monetary poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NFHS is a valuable source of data for poverty assessment, the global MPI doesn't exclusively rely on it.  Various data sources are used depending on the country and availability. Statement 2 is correct. India's NMPI incorporates indicators beyond the original global MPI, including maternal health and bank account access, reflecting the country's specific context. Statement 3 is incorrect. The MPI is a multidimensional measure, encompassing aspects beyond just income poverty, such as health, education, and living standards.  The addition of indicators like maternal health and bank accounts in the NMPI underscores the holistic approach to poverty reduction in India, recognizing that poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various social and economic factors.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (focused on economic concepts and policies),  the "Indian History" question type is inapplicable.

**1. With reference to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the respective State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS).
2.  PACS are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
3. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PACS, being grassroots-level cooperative credit institutions, fall under the purview of state cooperative societies acts and are governed by the respective State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While DCCBs are regulated by the RBI, PACS themselves are not directly under RBI's regulatory umbrella.  They operate outside the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Statement 3 is correct. DCCBs are a vital link in the cooperative credit structure, providing financial support to PACS to facilitate their lending operations to farmers.  The DCCBs channel funds from various sources to the PACS.  The incorrect inclusion of RBI regulation in Statement 2 is a key distractor, designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the regulatory framework for PACS.


**2. With reference to the ISI Mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI Mark is awarded by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, ensuring product quality and safety.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) issues Quality Control Orders (QCOs) to make the ISI mark mandatory for specific products.
3.  The ISI mark is mandatory for all consumer goods sold in India, regardless of the product category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the ISI mark signifies product quality and safety, it's the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, that develops and administers the ISI Mark Scheme.  Statement 2 is correct. The BIS, under its ISI Mark Scheme, uses QCOs to mandate the mark for specific product categories deemed crucial for consumer safety and quality control. Statement 3 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not mandatory for *all* consumer goods.  It's selectively applied to certain product categories like electrical appliances, cement, and steel products, based on risk assessment and consumer protection needs. The inclusion of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the blanket application of the ISI mark across all products in Statements 1 and 3 are designed as effective distractors.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy aimed to achieve agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2022.
2. Rice is the leading agricultural export product of India, comprising over 50% of the total value.
3.  The Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme focuses on supporting the development of agricultural infrastructure like cold chains and storage facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ambitious target set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018 was indeed to reach $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice is a significant export, it does not account for more than 50% of the total value. The actual percentage is considerably lower. Statement 3 is incorrect. The MAI scheme's primary focus is on market development and product-specific strategies for accessing target export markets; infrastructure development is mainly addressed under separate schemes like the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES).  The overestimation of rice's export share and the misattribution of infrastructure development to the MAI scheme are designed to create confusion and test detailed knowledge.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Monetary Policy Transmission:**

1. Monetary policy transmission refers to the process by which changes in the policy repo rate directly impact inflation within one quarter.
2.  The RBI Act, 1934 (as amended in 2016), provides the statutory basis for the RBI's monetary policy framework.
3. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) determines the inflation target every five years, in consultation with the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While changes in the policy repo rate are intended to affect inflation, the transmission mechanism is more complex and indirect, taking time to fully manifest in the economy. It doesn’t happen within one quarter.  Statement 2 is correct. The amended RBI Act, 1934, provides the legal framework for the RBI's monetary policy functions and the MPC's role in setting interest rates. Statement 3 is correct. The inflation target is determined jointly by the Central Government and the RBI, with a review and potential revision every five years. The oversimplification of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the incorrect timeframe for its impact are designed to act as distractors, testing the candidate’s understanding of the nuances of monetary policy.


**5. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is published bi-annually by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).
2. The FI-Index incorporates details from banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.
3.  The FI-Index uses a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial inclusion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published annually, not bi-annually, by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not NABARD. Statement 2 is correct.  The FI-Index indeed encompasses a broad range of financial services across different sectors, reflecting a holistic view of financial inclusion. Statement 3 is incorrect.  A score of 100 represents complete financial inclusion; a score of 0 represents complete exclusion. The incorrect publishing frequency and the inverted interpretation of the index's maximum value are intended to act as challenging distractors.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS was launched in 2021 under the Alternate Grievance Redressal (AGR) framework of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2. The scheme covers all commercial banks, but excludes Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative Banks.
3.  The objective of the RB-IOS is to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints related to services provided by RBI regulated entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RB-IOS is an initiative of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI, and falls under RBI's AGR framework.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme's coverage explicitly includes Regional Rural Banks and certain categories of Cooperative Banks. Statement 3 is correct. The scheme's core purpose is to provide a cost-effective and accessible mechanism for resolving customer grievances against RBI-regulated entities.  The incorrect attribution of the scheme to SEBI and the exclusion of certain bank types in Statements 1 and 2 are strategically placed distractors.


**7. With reference to the  Green Shoots in the FMCG sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Green shoots are indicators of economic recovery and growth specifically after a period of recession in the manufacturing sector.
2. The RBI recently identified India's rural economy as a significant contributor to green shoots in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector.
3. FMCG products are characterized by low turnover and long shelf life, facilitating efficient inventory management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Green shoots are indeed indicators of economic recovery and growth, but they are not limited to the manufacturing sector. They can apply to any sector experiencing a resurgence after an economic downturn.  Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI's observation highlighted the rural economy's role in driving growth within the FMCG sector. Statement 3 is incorrect. FMCG products are defined by their high turnover and relatively short shelf life, reflecting their fast consumption patterns.  The restrictive definition of green shoots and the incorrect characterization of FMCG product lifecycles are key distractors.


**8. With reference to  KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics), consider the following statements:**

1. KISAN is a government initiative aimed at improving crop yield estimation through the use of satellite imagery and geographic information systems.
2. The primary objective of KISAN is to provide crop insurance to farmers based on the actual yield, instead of the estimated yield.
3. ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is a platform that directly feeds real-time crop yield data into the KISAN system for precise insurance calculations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. KISAN leverages space technology and GIS to enhance the accuracy of crop yield estimation, aiding in better resource allocation and policy formulation.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While KISAN improves yield estimation, its primary focus is not directly on providing crop insurance; that is handled through separate schemes.  Statement 3 is correct. ADeX is indeed a data exchange platform which provides relevant data, but its linkage to KISAN is for improved yield estimation, not direct insurance calculation.  The misrepresentation of KISAN's direct role in insurance and the overstated linkage between ADeX and insurance calculations are used as effective distractors.


**9. With reference to the  Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is determined solely by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) based on market demand and supply dynamics.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Union Ministry of Agriculture.
3. MSP currently covers 22 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops and some commercial crops.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FCI is involved in procurement at MSP, but the MSP itself is not determined by the FCI alone.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CACP makes recommendations, the final decision on MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not just the Ministry of Agriculture. Statement 3 is correct. The MSP currently applies to 22 crops, encompassing Kharif, Rabi, and some commercial crops.  The incorrect attribution of MSP determination to the FCI and the Ministry of Agriculture are designed as distractors to test the candidate's understanding of the decision-making process.


**10. With reference to  India’s transition from LIBOR, consider the following statements:**

1. LIBOR is a benchmark interest rate used primarily for short-term loans in the domestic Indian interbank market.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has established Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) to replace LIBOR.
3.  The Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL) is a government-owned entity responsible for administering ARRs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. LIBOR is a global benchmark, not specifically for the Indian domestic market; it's used in international interbank lending. Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI has indeed implemented ARRs as a replacement for LIBOR. Statement 3 is incorrect. FBIL is a private limited company, jointly owned by various market institutions, not a government-owned entity.  The incorrect characterization of LIBOR's scope and the misidentification of FBIL's ownership are designed as distractors to assess a candidate's precise knowledge of the LIBOR transition.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) as per the RBI framework:**

1.  An SRO must be a not-for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, possessing adequate net worth and diversified shareholding, representing its sector.
2.  The SRO's Articles of Association/bye-laws must detail the Governing Body's functioning and specify the SRO's roles, mandating at least one-third independent members on the Board of Directors, including the Chairperson.
3.  SROs are primarily tasked with promoting a compliance culture, assisting smaller entities, acting as a collective voice for members, gathering sectoral data, and fostering R&D within their respective sectors.  They are not responsible for directly handling customer complaints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognising SROs. Statement 1 correctly outlines the eligibility criteria for an SRO, emphasizing its not-for-profit nature, registration under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, and the need for sufficient financial strength and representative membership. Statement 2 accurately describes the governance requirements, including the composition of the Board of Directors and the importance of clearly defined roles and responsibilities within the SRO's operational framework. Statement 3 correctly identifies the core objectives of SROs, focusing on promoting compliance, supporting smaller entities, representing members collectively, collecting sectoral information, and stimulating research and development.  The RBI's role is oversight and not direct complaint handling, making the assertion in the third statement accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of all three statements.


**2. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework, effective from April 1, 2025, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  The framework's primary objective is to enhance the precision and flexibility in addressing the financial health of UCBs, focusing on capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.
3.  UCBs categorized as Tier 1 are excluded from the PCA framework because they are considered financially stable and do not require intervention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct representations of the RBI's PCA framework for UCBs. Statement 1 accurately reflects the framework's implementation timeline, its replacement of the SAF, and its applicability to UCBs excluding those under AID. Statement 2 correctly highlights the framework's goal of improving the precision and flexibility of interventions to address UCB financial health, focusing on key parameters. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The PCA framework applies to UCBs across various tiers (Tier 2, 3, and 4), not excluding any based solely on their tier classification.  The existence of tiers implies a spectrum of financial health, and the PCA framework is designed to address concerns across this spectrum. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer, as it accurately identifies statements 1 and 2 as correct.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND) and operates as a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  The establishment of a UO for India's UCB sector was initially recommended by an RBI working group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006, with a detailed model proposed in 2009 by a group led by Shri N.S. Viswanathan.
3.  NUCFDC's primary functions include providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs, ensuring regulatory compliance, and developing a shared technological platform to enhance service delivery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes NUCFDC's registration with the RBI and its role as an SRO for UCBs. Statement 3 correctly identifies its key functions: liquidity and capital support, regulatory compliance assistance, and the development of a shared technology platform. However, statement 2 incorrectly reverses the names and timelines of the RBI working groups that initially proposed the need for and model for a UO for the UCB sector.  The Viswanathan committee's report came first (2006), highlighting the need, followed by the Das committee's detailed model (2009).  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in India:**

1. ARCs are financial institutions that acquire Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions, enabling the latter to improve their balance sheets.  They are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2. The SARFAESI Act of 2002 mandated that ARCs be registered and regulated by the RBI, a provision initially suggested by the Narasimham Committee II in 1998.
3.  ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 8 years of acquisition and redeem the security receipts representing these assets.  Failure to do so results in automatic liquidation of the ARC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While ARCs do acquire NPAs to help banks clean up their balance sheets, they are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the SARFAESI Act of 2002 and the Narasimham Committee II (1998) as the origin of the regulatory framework for ARCs under the RBI. Statement 3 is also correct, outlining the timeframe for asset resolution and redemption of security receipts.  The consequence of failure to meet this timeframe is not automatic liquidation, but other regulatory actions, making the statement still largely accurate in the context of the question.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the situation.


**5. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. UPI, launched in 2016, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), established in 2007 under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.
2.  NPCI is a joint venture between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), operating as an umbrella organization for retail payments and settlement systems in India.
3.  The internationalization of UPI is currently limited to South Asian countries, with no significant expansion into other regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the UPI and NPCI. Statement 1 correctly identifies the launch year, the developer (NPCI), and the enabling legislation. Statement 2 correctly describes NPCI's establishment and its role as an umbrella organization for retail payments.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The internationalization of UPI is actively expanding beyond South Asia, with partnerships and implementations in various countries, including those in Europe and the Middle East.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer, as only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**6. With reference to the Geographical Indications Act of 1999, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act guarantees collective rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions, protecting the unique characteristics and reputation of products originating from those areas.
2.  The Act's protection extends to both tangible and intangible aspects of traditional knowledge, including traditional practices, cultural heritage, and associated intellectual property rights.
3.  The Act's enforcement mechanism relies solely on civil lawsuits filed by affected producers or organizations, with no provisions for governmental intervention or administrative action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the core purpose of the Geographical Indications Act of 1999 – protecting the collective rights associated with geographically specific products and their unique characteristics.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Act protects the reputation linked to a geographical area, it primarily focuses on the tangible products themselves and doesn't explicitly cover all forms of intangible traditional knowledge in the same way other legal frameworks might.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The Act provides for governmental oversight and administrative actions, in addition to allowing civil lawsuits.  Therefore, only statement 1 is fully accurate, making option (a) the correct answer.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act aimed to increase coal production by allowing the auctioning of coal mines for commercial mining to private entities, thereby reducing the dominance of Coal India Limited (CIL).
2. The Act introduced a new system of licensing, replacing the previous allocation method that was perceived as lacking transparency and efficiency.
3.  The Act mandated that all coal mines auctioned under its provisions must adhere to stringent environmental regulations, regardless of the winning bidder's track record.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects one of the primary objectives of the CMSP Act, 2015 – to increase coal production by opening up the sector to private players through auctions.  Statement 2 is also correct in that it introduced auctioning as a more transparent allocation method.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act did emphasize environmental considerations, it didn't impose absolute requirements regardless of the bidder's history.  Environmental compliance was a factor in the bidding process but not an absolute barrier to participation. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully accurate, making option (a) the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules introduced a Certificate of Inventorship to formally acknowledge the contributions of all inventors involved in a patented invention, irrespective of their role or contribution size.
2. The rules reduced the time limit for filing a request for examination of a patent application from 48 months to 31 months, encouraging faster processing of patent applications.
3. The rules introduced a new category of "fast-track" patent examination for applications related to renewable energy technologies, prioritizing these applications for faster processing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the introduction of the Certificate of Inventorship to formally recognize all inventors. Statement 2 accurately reflects the reduction in the time limit for examination requests. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the rules aimed to streamline the process, they did not introduce a specific "fast-track" category exclusively for renewable energy technologies.  The focus was on overall efficiency improvements, not a preferential treatment for a particular sector.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making option (a) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to the  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty, adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), is the first WIPO treaty to address the interplay between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK), aiming to prevent biopiracy.
2.  The treaty's implementation requires ratification by at least 15 parties before coming into effect three months later, and membership is open to all WIPO member states.
3.  The treaty explicitly mandates that all GRs and TK used in patented inventions must be disclosed, with the patent application automatically rejected if the source and consent of the knowledge holders cannot be verified.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the treaty's nature as the first WIPO treaty to address the complex relationship between IP, GRs, and TK, and its goal of preventing biopiracy. Statement 2 accurately outlines the treaty's implementation process and membership criteria. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While the treaty encourages transparency and disclosure, it doesn't mandate automatic rejection solely based on the inability to verify source and consent.  The treaty aims to establish a framework for equitable benefit sharing but doesn't impose such a strict, automatic rejection mechanism.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making option (a) the correct answer.


**10. Consider the following statements about the One Future Alliance:**

1. It is a voluntary initiative proposed by the G20 India Presidency to enhance the capacity of Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to implement Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).
2. The alliance focuses solely on financial assistance, providing substantial funding to LMICs without requiring any reciprocal commitments or policy reforms.
3. The alliance's activities include capacity building, technical assistance, and funding support for DPI implementation in LMICs, promoting global collaboration in this area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the One Future Alliance's primary objective of promoting DPI adoption in LMICs.  Statement 3 correctly highlights the alliance's multi-faceted approach, encompassing capacity building, technical assistance, and funding.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The alliance doesn't provide funding without any conditions or expectations of policy reforms in recipient countries.  It involves a collaborative approach, requiring some level of commitment and policy alignment from LMICs to ensure the effective use of resources.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully accurate, making option (a) the correct answer.


**1. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
2.  One of the key functions of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) is to provide financial assistance to PACS.
3.  The National Cooperative Database (NCD) offers comprehensive information exclusively on PACS operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS). They fall outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are not regulated by the RBI.  Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS, which are the grassroots-level arms of the short-term cooperative credit structure.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCD provides information about the cooperative sector, it's not limited to PACS; it encompasses a broader range of cooperative entities.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the regulatory framework and operational aspects of PACS within the Indian cooperative credit system.  The distractors aim to confuse candidates who may have a superficial understanding of the subject.


**2. With reference to the regulatory framework for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, grants the RBI the authority to supersede the boards of UCBs but does not extend to their winding-up procedures.
2.  UCBs are subject to dual regulation: the RBI oversees banking functions, while State/Central Registrars of Cooperative Societies manage administrative and managerial aspects.
3.  All UCBs, irrespective of their tier categorization, are mandated to achieve a priority sector lending target of 75% by March 2026.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2020 amendment significantly broadened RBI's powers over UCBs, including the authority to supersede boards and handle winding-up procedures. Statement 2 is correct. This dual regulatory structure reflects the unique nature of UCBs as both cooperative societies and banking institutions. Statement 3 is incorrect. While many UCBs are encouraged to meet the 75% priority sector lending target by March 2026, this is not a universal mandate for all UCBs across all tiers.  The question assesses understanding of the complexities of UCB regulation, highlighting the interplay between cooperative and banking regulatory frameworks.  The distractors play on the nuances of the regulatory changes introduced by the 2020 amendment and the varying requirements for different UCB categories.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), accepting public funds but lacking a direct customer interface.
2.  The establishment of a unified organization for India's UCB sector was initially recommended by a working group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.
3.  One of NUCFDC's key functions is to develop a shared technological platform to assist UCBs in expanding their services at reduced costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, indicating it does accept public funds and has a customer interface. Statement 2 is incorrect. The need for a unified organization was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006; the model was later recommended by a working group led by Shri V.S. Das in 2009. Statement 3 is correct.  This is a stated function of NUCFDC aimed at enhancing efficiency and reducing operational costs for UCBs. The question assesses knowledge of the NUCFDC's role, its regulatory classification, and the historical context of its formation. The distractors are carefully chosen to test detailed knowledge of the organization's structure and objectives.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  The key monitoring areas under the new PCA framework include the capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs, with a focus on addressing their financial health with greater precision and flexibility.
3. The new PCA framework specifically excludes Tier 1 UCBs from its purview, focusing solely on UCBs categorized as Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The new PCA framework is designed to provide a more precise and flexible approach to addressing the financial health of UCBs, replacing the previous SAF.  It does, however, exclude UCBs under AID. Statement 2 is correct. Capital, asset quality, and profitability are central to the framework's monitoring and intervention mechanisms. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PCA framework applies to UCBs across all tiers (2, 3, and 4), excluding only those under AID. The question assesses understanding of the RBI's approach to regulating UCBs and the specifics of the PCA framework.  The distractors test the candidate's grasp of the framework's scope and application.


**5. With reference to the initiatives taken to strengthen Self Help Groups (SHGs) and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI, in 2014, recognized only Sa-Dhan as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for MFIs.
2.  The SHG-Bank Linkage Programme, launched by NABARD in 1992, is among the world's most extensive microfinance programs, providing financial services to underprivileged households.
3.  The 2024 Union Budget increased the loan limit under the Tarun Plus scheme to ₹20 lakh from the existing ₹10 lakh for those who have previously availed and successfully repaid loans under the Tarun category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In 2014, the RBI recognized both the Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) and Sa-Dhan as SROs for MFIs. Statement 2 is correct. The SHG-Bank Linkage Programme has been instrumental in expanding financial inclusion in rural India. Statement 3 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget did indeed raise the loan limit for the Tarun Plus scheme as stated. The question tests knowledge of government policies and initiatives aimed at strengthening the microfinance sector. The distractors focus on specific details regarding SRO recognition and budgetary allocations.


**6. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs, except Housing Finance Companies, with assets exceeding ₹100 crore and involved in accepting deposits or interacting with customers, are subject to RBI's Ombudsman scheme.
2.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) extends its deposit insurance facility to depositors of all NBFCs up to a maximum amount of ₹5 lakh.
3.  The National Housing Bank regulates all types of NBFCs, including those engaged in merchant banking and venture capital activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI's Ombudsman scheme covers a significant portion of the NBFC sector as described. Statement 2 is incorrect.  DICGC insurance is limited to banks and not extended to NBFCs. Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Housing Bank focuses on Housing Finance Companies; other types of NBFCs are regulated by different entities (e.g., SEBI, IRDAI).  The question examines understanding of the regulatory landscape for NBFCs and the differences between NBFCs and banks. The distractors involve the scope of the Ombudsman scheme and the regulatory roles of various financial sector regulators.


**7.  With reference to the Jute sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the exclusive use of jute packaging for all commodities.
2.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI), established in 1971, primarily functions as a price support agency and implements the Jute I-CARE project focusing on mechanization and improved retting techniques.
3. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, plays a significant role in protecting the traditional knowledge associated with jute cultivation and processing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1987 Act mandates the use of jute packaging for specific commodities, not all. Statement 2 is correct. JCI's role as a price support agency and its implementation of the Jute I-CARE project accurately reflect its functions. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Geographical Indications Act protects traditional knowledge, its application to jute is not its primary focus, and other acts and mechanisms also protect this knowledge. The question tests knowledge of the jute sector's policies and regulations. The distractors involve the scope of the 1987 Act and the specific roles of different legal frameworks in protecting traditional knowledge.


**8.  With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, provides a comprehensive overview of the rural population's financial inclusion status, including access to loans, insurance, and pensions, but excludes data on livelihoods.
2.  The NAFINDEX, a measure of financial inclusion, is solely based on data collected through the NAFIS.
3. The second NAFIS offers insights into the economic and financial indicators of rural development since 2016-17.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS does include data on livelihoods as part of its comprehensive assessment of the rural population's financial inclusion. Statement 2 is incorrect. While NAFIS data is a major component of NAFINDEX, it's not the exclusive source. Other relevant data may also be incorporated. Statement 3 is correct. The second NAFIS provides valuable insights into the progress of rural development. The question tests knowledge of NAFIS's scope and the metrics used to assess financial inclusion. The distractors involve the comprehensiveness of NAFIS and the data sources used to generate NAFINDEX.


**9. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMGS NMP is developed using a digital master planning tool based on proprietary software and hosted on a private cloud infrastructure.
2.  The PMGS NMP integrates data from various ministries, including projects under Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN, but excludes inland waterways projects.
3.  The PM GatiShakti approach is driven by seven engines, including railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs primarily acquire Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions to resolve them, not to lend.  Their function is asset resolution, not lending.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ARCs are registered and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. This reflects the RBI's role in overseeing the financial stability of the banking sector and related institutions.

Statement 3 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) indeed played a crucial role in proposing the establishment of ARCs in India, drawing parallels with international best practices in asset management.  This demonstrates a proactive approach to addressing financial sector challenges by adopting global best practices.

1. NUCFDC is registered with the Reserve Bank of India as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2. NUCFDC operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) sector.
3.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI working group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, differentiating them from Type I NBFCs.

1. A wilful default is considered to have occurred when the borrower has the capacity to pay but fails to do so due to reasons other than genuine financial distress.
2. A large defaulter is defined as a borrower with an outstanding amount of ₹50 lakh and above, regardless of whether a suit has been filed or the account classified as doubtful or loss.
3.  Lenders are required to establish an Identification Committee to examine evidence of wilful default only when the outstanding amount exceeds ₹1 crore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A wilful default involves several factors, including the borrower's capacity to pay, diversion of funds, disposal of assets, and failure to infuse equity.  It's not simply a matter of capacity to pay but also involves intent and actions of the borrower.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of a large defaulter involves an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above, not ₹50 lakh. This reflects a threshold for triggering specific regulatory actions.

Statement 3 is correct. The requirement for an Identification Committee applies only when the outstanding amount exceeds ₹1 crore. This tiered approach reflects a risk-based approach to addressing defaults.


**8. With reference to the Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA), consider the following statements:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ICA serves as a crucial tool for managing credit risk and coordinating actions among multiple lenders to a single borrower in the event of a default.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ICA establishes a hierarchy, the priority of payment can be influenced by the value of outstanding credit and other factors stipulated in the agreement. The agreement doesn't solely rely on pre-defined hierarchies but also considers the value of the outstanding credit.

Statement 3 is correct. The 75% by value and 60% by number threshold reflects the principle of majority rule in decision-making among lenders in the context of ICA. This ensures that a substantial majority of lenders agree before a binding decision is made.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC, 2016, was enacted in 2016, not 2017.  The year of enactment is a crucial piece of information for understanding the timeline of legal reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Information Utilities (IUs) collect and disseminate financial information to facilitate the insolvency resolution process, but the management of insolvency, liquidation, and bankruptcy processes is primarily handled by Insolvency Professionals (IPs).

Statement 3 is correct.  NCLT serves as the adjudicating authority for CIRP and liquidation of corporate entities, highlighting the role of specialized tribunals in handling complex insolvency cases.  This reflects the importance of establishing specialized judicial mechanisms for efficient resolution.


**10.  With reference to the Microfinance sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI, in 2023, increased the individual loan limit under the Tarun Plus scheme to ₹25 lakh from the existing ₹10 lakh.
2.  The Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) and Sa-Dhan were recognized as Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) by the RBI in 2015.
3.  The SHG-Bank Linkage Program, initiated by NABARD in 1992, is designed to provide financial services to affluent households.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 Union Budget increased the Tarun Plus loan limit to ₹20 lakh, not ₹25 lakh.  The specific numerical value is crucial for understanding the scheme's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI recognized MFIN and Sa-Dhan as SROs in 2014, not 2015. This subtle difference in years highlights the significance of precise factual recall.

**1. With reference to the impact of colonization on economic development, consider the following statements:**

1.  In resource-rich colonies, extractive institutions established by colonizers often led to a lack of long-term investment due to high risks of confiscation.
2.  Colonizers consistently established inclusive political and economic systems in all their colonies, benefiting both the colonizers and the colonized populations equally.
3.  The establishment of inclusive institutions in sparsely populated colonies incentivized individuals to work, save, and invest for the long term, fostering economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Extractive institutions, designed to benefit the colonizer by extracting resources, often lacked the rule of law and property rights necessary for long-term investment.  The constant threat of confiscation discouraged private investment and hindered sustainable economic development.  This was a common feature in many colonized territories, especially those rich in natural resources.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Colonizers did not uniformly establish inclusive institutions across all their colonies.  Their policies varied significantly depending on the specific context, including the colony's population density, resource endowment, and strategic importance. In many cases, colonial rule resulted in exploitative systems that primarily benefited the colonizers at the expense of the local population.


Statement 3 is correct. In some sparsely populated colonies, where the colonizers aimed for long-term settlement, they did establish more inclusive institutions to attract European settlers.  These institutions, by providing secure property rights and a stable legal framework, encouraged investment, savings, and long-term economic activity.  This is a key aspect of the debate on the long-term consequences of colonization, highlighting the diverse and often contradictory impacts of colonial rule.  The presence of these institutions contributed to the later economic development of these regions, although often at the expense of indigenous populations.

3. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is not involved in policy-level matters concerning PPPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's target is ₹6.0 lakh crore, not ₹8.0 lakh crore.  The amount is incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. The statement incorrectly specifies the level of projects evaluated.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit plays a crucial role in policy-level matters concerning PPPs.  The statement is factually incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India:**

1. The RBI publishes the FI-Index annually in July, providing a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 represents complete exclusion and 100 represents full inclusion.
2.  The FI-Index incorporates details from banking, investments, and insurance sectors, but excludes the postal and pension sectors.
3. The index is structured around three main parameters: Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%),  reflecting the extent of financial inclusion across the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI does publish the FI-Index annually in July, using a scale of 0 to 100 to represent the level of financial inclusion.  The description of the scale accurately reflects the index's purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index explicitly includes details from the banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.  The question incorrectly omits the postal and pension sectors from the index's scope, acting as a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The three parameters – Access, Usage, and Quality – and their respective weightages are accurately reflected in the statement.  This accurately describes the structure of the FI-Index.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.



**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RB-IOS, launched in 2021, operates under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, but excludes the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, from its legal framework.
2. The scheme aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints related to services offered by all Regulated Entities of the RBI, including Housing Finance Companies.
3.  RB-IOS covers all commercial banks and Regional Rural Banks, but excludes Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks and Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS's legal framework explicitly includes the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. The question incorrectly states that the latter two acts are excluded.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the scheme aims for cost-free redressal, it specifically excludes Housing Finance Companies from its coverage of Regulated Entities.  This is a key detail that makes the statement false.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The scheme explicitly includes Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks and Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above within its coverage. The statement falsely claims their exclusion.  All three statements contain inaccuracies, making option (a) the correct answer.



**3. With reference to the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the Code on Wages (2019), consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, specifies a uniform minimum wage applicable across all states and sectors in India.
2. The Code on Wages (2019) aims to establish a universal wage floor applicable to all states once implemented, thereby replacing the Minimum Wages Act, 1948.
3.  The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, have overlapping jurisdiction in setting minimum wages for certain jobs, potentially creating confusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, does *not* specify a uniform minimum wage across all states and sectors.  It provides a framework, but the actual minimum wage varies by state and occupation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Code on Wages (2019) aims to create a universal wage floor, but it does not entirely replace the Minimum Wages Act, 1948.  Both acts may coexist in some capacity pending full implementation of the Code.

Statement 3 is correct.  There is indeed overlapping jurisdiction between the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, and the Contract Labour Act, 1970, regarding minimum wage setting for certain jobs, leading to potential inconsistencies and confusion.  Only statement 3 is accurate.



**4. Consider the following statements about Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs):**

1.  The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) designates D-SIIs based solely on their asset size, irrespective of market importance and interconnectedness.
2.  Insurers designated as D-SIIs are considered to be of such size and market importance that their distress or failure would not cause significant dislocation in the domestic financial system.
3. Life Insurance Corporation of India, General Insurance Corporation of India, and New India Assurance Company have been identified by IRDAI as D-SIIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IRDAI's designation of D-SIIs considers not only size but also market importance and domestic and global interconnectedness. The statement simplifies the criteria.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The definition of D-SIIs explicitly states that their distress or failure *would* cause significant dislocation in the domestic financial system. The statement contradicts this definition.

Statement 3 is correct.  The IRDAI has indeed identified the three mentioned insurance companies as D-SIIs.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**5. With reference to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. All collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to high-income households (annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000) are treated as microfinance loans by the RBI.
2.  Microfinance Institutions typically charge lower interest rates compared to those charged by commercial banks.
3. The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a framework to regulate Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating as MFIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI defines microfinance loans as those given to low-income households with an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000.  The statement incorrectly states the opposite.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MFIs generally charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks due to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income borrowers.

Statement 3 is correct. The Malegam Committee did indeed recommend a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**6.  With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMMY provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to corporate and non-farm small/micro enterprises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMMY specifically targets *non-corporate* small/micro enterprises.  The inclusion of "corporate" is a key error.

Statement 2 is correct. The categorization of loans into 'Shishu', 'Kishore', and 'Tarun' is accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 2024 Union Budget *increased* the loan limit, introducing a "Tarun Plus" category.  The statement wrongly indicates a decrease.  Only statement 2 is correct.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):**

1. A Non-Performing Asset (NPA) is a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 60 days.
2. Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) refers to the sum of all loan assets classified as NPAs.
3. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) is responsible for assessing and mitigating NPAs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An NPA is overdue for more than 90 days, not 60.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of GNPA is accurately presented.

Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading. The FSDC does play a role but is not solely responsible for NPA assessment and mitigation.  The RBI and other institutions also have significant roles.  The phrasing of the statement is too absolute.  Therefore, only statement 2 is completely correct.


**8. With reference to the  Reserve Bank of India's (RBI)  treatment of Wilful Defaulters (WDs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's directions on WDs apply only to outstanding amounts below ₹25 lakh.
2. The RBI's directions on WDs are issued under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, but exclude the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005.
3.  A wilful defaulter is defined as an individual or entity that has intentionally defaulted on a loan or advance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's directions explicitly apply to outstanding amounts of ₹25 lakh and *above*.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's directions are issued under all three mentioned acts.

Statement 3 is correct. The definition of a wilful defaulter is accurately stated.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**9.  Consider the following statements concerning  Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for implementing all PPP projects in India.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit is responsible for policy-level matters, but not the direct implementation of all PPP projects.  Many other bodies are involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.

Statement 3 is correct. The NMP's objective is accurately described.  Thus, only statement 3 is correct.


**10. With reference to the  International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City)-IFSC was established as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in 2010.
2.  An IFSC caters exclusively to domestic customers within the jurisdiction of the Indian economy.
3.  The IFSC Authority is a statutory body established under the IFSC Act, 2019.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GIFT City-IFSC was established in 2015, not 2010.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  IFSCs cater to customers *outside* the domestic economy's jurisdiction.

Statement 3 is correct.  The IFSC Authority's establishment and legal basis are accurately stated.  Only statement 3 is correct.


**1. With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation is a component of aquaculture, a sector contributing approximately 1.5% to India's GDP.
2.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 2 million tonnes annually by 2025.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Seaweed farming falls under the broader umbrella of aquaculture, and the aquaculture and fishing sector contributes approximately 1.5% to India's GDP. This highlights the economic significance of marine resources in the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana's target for seaweed production is 1 million tonnes per year by 2025, not 2 million tonnes.  This demonstrates the importance of precise factual recall in understanding government schemes and their targets.  A slight inaccuracy can lead to an incorrect answer.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While NIOT-ACOSTI is indeed involved in offshore seaweed cultivation, their initial efforts were focused on the Andaman region, not Gujarat. The question uses a similar-sounding location to create a plausible distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific geographical locations and their association with government initiatives.  The focus on specific geographical details emphasizes the importance of detailed knowledge in the context of India's diverse geography and its impact on various sectors.


**2. With reference to India's Silk Production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India holds the position of the world's largest silk producer, contributing approximately 45% of global production in 2023.

3.  India produces all four major varieties of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India is the second largest producer of silk globally, contributing around 42% of the world's silk production in 2023, not 45%.  This highlights the need for precise numerical data in understanding India's position in the global market.  The question subtly alters the percentage to mislead candidates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Karnataka is the leading state in India’s silk production, contributing approximately 32% of the total output in 2023,  Andhra Pradesh is a significant contributor, but not the leading one. This tests candidates' knowledge of specific state-level contributions to national-level production.  The slight alteration in the state and its contribution acts as a strong distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. India indeed produces all four major varieties of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga.  This demonstrates the diversity of India's silk production and its potential for economic growth.  The factual accuracy of this statement contrasts with the inaccuracies in the other statements, making it crucial for selecting the correct option.

3.  DFCCIL is a joint venture between Indian Railways and a private sector partner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006, not 2008, under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the precise year of establishment, a detail easily overlooked.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Rail Plan 2030 aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% (2019) to 45% (2030), not 50%.  The slight alteration in the target percentage is a common technique used to create plausible distractors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. DFCCIL is a special purpose vehicle of Indian Railways, not a joint venture with a private sector partner.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the ownership structure of DFCCIL.  The question subtly introduces a private sector element to confuse candidates.


**4. With reference to India's Agricultural Technology Initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes technologies such as artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to aid decision-making in agriculture.
2.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, primarily holding data on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown.
3. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And Geoinformatics) primarily focuses on improving weather forecasting for better crop planning.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Krishi ICCC indeed leverages AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in the agricultural sector. This showcases the government's technological approach to agricultural management.

Statement 2 is correct. ADeX is accurately described as India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, focusing on the specified datasets.  The accurate description of ADeX’s function contrasts with the inaccuracies in other statements.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  KISAN's primary focus is on improving yield estimation, not weather forecasting.  The question alters the primary function of KISAN to act as a distractor. The subtle change in KISAN's function highlights the importance of understanding the precise objectives of agricultural technology initiatives.

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, with the final decision resting with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister.
2.  MSP currently covers 24 crops, including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 4 commercial crops.
3. Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CACP's role in recommending MSPs and the CCEA's final decision-making authority are accurately depicted. This demonstrates the process involved in determining MSPs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  MSP currently covers 22 crops, not 24. The question adds two extra crops to create a plausible but false statement, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the number of crops covered under the MSP scheme.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While FCI is a major procuring agency, it's not the nodal agency for *all* MSP-covered crops.  Other agencies are also involved in the procurement process. This tests the candidate's understanding of the intricacies of the procurement mechanism, highlighting the importance of not making generalizations.  The question creates a distractor by overstating FCI's role.


**6. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, aimed to achieve agricultural exports of $70 billion by 2022.
2. Agricultural exports in India experienced a 10% decline in 2023-24.
3. The decline in agricultural exports is primarily attributed to global economic slowdown.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was $60 billion by 2022, not $70 billion.  This highlights the importance of precise numerical data in assessing policy targets. The question modifies the target figure to create a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Agricultural exports registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, not 10%. The slight change in the percentage creates a plausible but inaccurate statement.

Statement 3 is correct. While various factors contribute to the decline, the global economic slowdown is a significant factor.  This statement provides a valid reason for the decline in exports, contrasting with the inaccurate details in the other statements.


**7. With reference to India's Port Sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Vadhvan Port, once operational, will be India's 14th major port.
2. Vadhvan Port is located in the Palghar district of Gujarat.
3. Vadhvan Port is designed to be one of India's largest deep-water container ports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vadhvan Port will be India's 13th major port, not the 14th. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the precise number of major ports in India.  A small numerical error makes this a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vadhvan Port is located in the Palghar district of Maharashtra, not Gujarat. This tests the candidate's understanding of the specific location of the port within India.  The question uses a neighboring state to create a geographically plausible but incorrect answer.

Statement 3 is correct. Vadhvan Port's design indeed incorporates features to make it one of India's largest deep-water container ports.  This statement stands in contrast to the two incorrect statements, highlighting the need for precise factual knowledge.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NLP 2022 and its CLAP with the mentioned action areas are accurately described. This showcases the government's approach to improving the logistics sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India aims to be among the top 25 countries, not top 20, in the LPI ranking by 2030. The question subtly alters the target ranking to create a plausible but incorrect statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The LEADS index is published by the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the World Bank. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the publishing body of the LEADS index.  The question introduces a well-known international organization to create a strong distractor.


**9.  With reference to India's Offshore Mineral Resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals except mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part A of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules apply to minerals *except* those specified in Part B, not Part A, of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957.  The question subtly changes the part of the schedule to create a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The polymetallic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts are found in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific geographical locations of these mineral deposits.  The question substitutes similar-sounding geographical locations to create plausible distractors.

Statement 3 is correct. The rules do indeed mandate the use of the modified UNFC and CRIRSCO template for exploration stages. This showcases the emphasis on standardized exploration practices for offshore mineral resources.  The factual accuracy of this statement contrasts with the inaccuracies in the other statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 was lower than the global average (97.7 kg vs 219.3 kg).  The question reverses the relative consumption figures to create a plausible but false statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The government's target for steel production by 2034 is 500 million tonnes, not 600 million tonnes.  The question increases the target figure to create a plausible but inaccurate statement.

Statement 3 is correct.  India's steel exports to the EU are indeed facing threats due to the imposition of a carbon tax. This highlights the challenges faced by the Indian steel sector in the global market.  The factual accuracy of this statement contrasts with the inaccuracies in the other statements.

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership primarily focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade for sustainable development.
2.  The EIF's Trust Fund Manager is the International Monetary Fund (IMF), collaborating with various international organizations.
3.  The EIF currently involves 51 partner countries, actively working towards poverty reduction through trade-led growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the EIF is a *multilateral*, not bilateral, partnership.  It involves numerous countries and international organizations working together. The core focus is on assisting LDCs in leveraging trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction, which is accurately described.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the EIF's Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the IMF. While the IMF might be involved in related development initiatives, it doesn't manage the EIF's trust fund directly.  The World Bank and WTO are also supporting organizations.

Statement 3 is correct. The EIF does indeed have 51 partner countries actively engaged in its initiatives aimed at poverty reduction through trade-led growth.  This is a factual and accurate statement.  The number of partner countries might change over time, but the core principle remains true.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the HDR is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The UNDP, not the World Bank, is the primary organization responsible for compiling and publishing the Human Development Report. The World Bank, while involved in development initiatives, has a different focus and reporting structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is indeed a key component of the HDR, measuring gender inequalities across the three dimensions mentioned. The statement accurately reflects the trend of India's improved GII ranking.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report was jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not the WHO.  Furthermore, while India has a large number of people in extreme poverty,  it is the country with the *largest* number, not the second largest, according to the report.

Statement 2 is correct. The MPI's methodology accurately describes its multidimensional approach to poverty measurement, using a threshold of one-third or more weighted deprivations to classify individuals as "MPI poor."  This is a significant departure from traditional, income-based poverty measures.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The NMPI, introduced by NITI Aayog, builds upon the global MPI framework but incorporates additional indicators relevant to the Indian context, such as maternal health and bank account access. This reflects a tailored approach to measuring poverty within a specific national context.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1. The 2024 Global MPI report indicates that approximately 18% of the global population, or 1.1 billion people, live in acute multidimensional poverty.
2.  The MPI measures poverty based solely on income levels, disregarding other crucial factors like education and healthcare.
3. India consistently ranks among the top three countries with the highest number of multidimensionally poor individuals, according to the MPI reports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The 2024 Global MPI report, released jointly by the UNDP and OPHI, highlights that 1.1 billion people (approximately 18% of the global population) experience acute multidimensional poverty.  This reflects a significant global challenge that needs concerted efforts to address.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MPI is explicitly designed to be a multidimensional measure of poverty. It goes beyond solely considering income and incorporates deprivations across various dimensions, including health, education, and living standards. The inclusion of these multiple dimensions provides a more comprehensive understanding of poverty than income-based measures alone.  It captures the multifaceted nature of poverty, recognizing that deprivation in one area can exacerbate vulnerabilities in others.

Statement 3 is also correct. Although the exact ranking may fluctuate slightly year to year, India consistently reports a very high number of people experiencing multidimensional poverty. This underscores the significant challenges India faces in poverty reduction, despite progress in certain areas.  The large population of India contributes to this high number, but the underlying deprivations within various segments of the population are a cause for concern and require focused policy interventions.




**2. With reference to India's National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMPI, introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, utilizes data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) to assess multidimensional poverty.
2. The NMPI incorporates all the original indicators from the global MPI model, excluding any additional indicators specific to the Indian context.
3.  The NMPI value is calculated by simply adding the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  The NFHS provides crucial data on health and related indicators, making it a suitable source for the NMPI's multidimensional assessment. The NSS, while valuable for other socio-economic data, doesn't possess the same comprehensive coverage on the specific indicators used in the NMPI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMPI not only retains the 10 original indicators from the global MPI model but also adds two additional indicators relevant to the Indian context: maternal health and bank account ownership.  These additions are crucial for capturing the specific dimensions of poverty relevant to India's unique socioeconomic landscape.  The inclusion of these additional indicators enhances the accuracy and relevance of the NMPI.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMPI value is calculated by multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), not by adding them. This multiplicative approach reflects the fact that both the proportion of the population in poverty (H) and the average intensity of deprivation (A) are crucial components in understanding the overall level of multidimensional poverty.  Simply adding them would not accurately reflect the combined impact of these two factors.




**3. With reference to the concept of "polycrisis" as defined in the World Bank's report, consider the following statements:**

1. A polycrisis is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple, interconnected crises, primarily focused on economic downturns.
2.  The World Bank's report suggests that the polycrisis has significantly hindered global poverty reduction and widened the prosperity gap in recent years.
3. The prosperity gap, as defined in the report, measures the average income level needed to bring everyone globally to a standard of living equivalent to $10 per person per day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but incomplete. A polycrisis is indeed characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple, interconnected crises. However, it's not solely focused on economic downturns.  The World Bank's report highlights the convergence of several crises, including slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty. These crises are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, creating a more complex and challenging situation than isolated economic problems.

Statement 2 is correct. The World Bank's report directly states that the polycrisis has stalled global poverty reduction and widened the prosperity gap during the past five years.  This demonstrates the significant impact of interconnected crises on global development goals.  The report emphasizes the need for comprehensive and integrated strategies to address these challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The prosperity gap, as defined in the World Bank's report, aims to bring everyone to a standard of $25 per person per day, not $10. This higher figure reflects a more ambitious target for global prosperity and highlights the significant income disparities that need to be addressed.  The difference between $10 and $25 is substantial, reflecting a critical detail in understanding the scale of the challenge.


**4. With reference to the NaBFID (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is a Public Financial Institution (PFI) established under the Companies Act, 2013, and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  NaBFID's primary objective is to provide short-term, high-risk infrastructure financing to promote rapid economic growth.
3. The entire shareholding of NaBFID is currently held by the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NaBFID is indeed a Public Financial Institution (PFI) notified under the Companies Act, 2013, it is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The RBI's oversight is crucial given NaBFID's role in the financial system and its focus on infrastructure financing. SEBI, on the other hand, primarily regulates the securities market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support the development of *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing.  The focus on long-term financing is critical for sustainable infrastructure development, and non-recourse financing reduces the risk for borrowers.  Short-term, high-risk financing would be counterproductive to NaBFID's goals of sustainable and responsible infrastructure development.

Statement 3 is correct. The entire shareholding of NaBFID is currently held by the Government of India. This reflects the government's commitment to infrastructure development and its role in guiding and supporting NaBFID's activities.  The government's ownership ensures alignment with national development priorities and provides the necessary resources for NaBFID's operations.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Invest India's projection for India's e-commerce market by 2030 is $325 billion, not $400 billion. This projection reflects the anticipated growth in the sector, driven by factors such as increasing internet penetration and digital adoption.  The difference between $325 billion and $400 billion may seem small but reflects an important factual inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  In 2022, the Indian e-commerce sector made up approximately 7% of India's total retail market, not 10%. While the sector is growing rapidly, it still constitutes a relatively smaller portion of the overall retail market compared to traditional retail channels. The difference between 7% and 10% is significant in terms of market share analysis.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  100% FDI under the automatic route is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.  This restriction aims to protect the interests of India's unorganized retail sector.  FDI is permitted in the marketplace model, where the e-commerce entity acts as a facilitator between buyers and sellers, not as an owner of inventory.  The distinction between these models is crucial for understanding FDI regulations in the Indian e-commerce sector.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly mentions an 8% decline in agricultural exports during 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy. This indicates a significant shortfall rather than an increase in exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) is designed to improve the infrastructure related to exporting agricultural products. It focuses on projects with strong export linkages, such as border haats, land custom stations, cold chains, and trade promotion centers.  It aims to enhance the efficiency and capacity of the export process, not primarily on improving domestic market access.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text indicates that rice constitutes a substantial portion (21%) of India's total agricultural exports, with marine products also forming a significant component (15%). This highlights the importance of these products in the nation's overall agricultural export basket.


**4. With reference to the Pandemic Fund Project in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pandemic Fund Project is a $50 million initiative funded solely by the World Health Organization (WHO).
2.  A major intervention under the project involves upgrading animal health laboratories and vaccine manufacturing facilities.
3.  The project is implemented exclusively by the World Bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pandemic Fund Project is a $25 million initiative, not $50 million.  Furthermore, it is funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund, not solely by the WHO.  Multiple international organizations contribute to the funding.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key focus of the Pandemic Fund Project is to strengthen animal health security in India. Upgrading and expanding animal health laboratories and vaccine manufacturing facilities are major components of this effort, crucial for enhancing preparedness and response capabilities to animal health threats and pandemics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The project is not implemented solely by the World Bank. The text mentions that the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are all involved in implementing the project.  This collaborative approach ensures a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to addressing animal health challenges.


**5. With reference to the White Revolution 2.0, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying released Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on ‘White Revolution 2’.
2. White Revolution 2.0 primarily focuses on improving the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds.
3.  The initiative aims to increase milk production by focusing solely on increasing the number of dairy cattle.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Cooperatives, not the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, released the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for White Revolution 2.0.  This highlights the government's commitment to improving the dairy sector through standardized operational guidelines.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While improving the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds is a component, White Revolution 2.0 is a broader initiative encompassing various aspects of the dairy sector, including technology, infrastructure, and market access.  It's not solely focused on indigenous breeds.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  White Revolution 2.0 is not limited to simply increasing the number of dairy cattle.  It incorporates a more holistic approach, involving improvements in breeding, feeding, management, and disease control to enhance overall milk production.  Increasing cattle numbers alone is insufficient for sustainable and efficient milk production.  Improved productivity per animal is equally or more important.


**1. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The AIF provides loans up to ₹5 Crores with a 5% interest subvention per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE and NABARD Sanrakshan.
2.  The AIF's expansion includes allowing convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for individual farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) only.
3.  Integrated primary and secondary processing projects are now eligible activities under the expanded AIF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the AIF provides loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹5 Crores, with a 3% interest subvention, not 5%. While credit guarantee coverage is indeed provided under CGTMSE, the expansion also includes NABARD Sanrakshan for FPOs.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the AIF's convergence with PM-KUSUM Component-A extends to farmer groups and cooperatives in addition to individual farmers and FPOs.

Statement 3 is correct. The AIF's expansion explicitly includes integrated primary and secondary processing projects in the list of eligible activities.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.  The other options incorrectly include statements that contain factual inaccuracies regarding loan amounts, interest subvention rates, and the scope of eligible beneficiaries and activities.


**2. With reference to the "Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies, Today and Tomorrow" report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as part of its efforts to promote sustainable agricultural practices.
2.  The report categorizes agritech's role in shaping the agricultural ecosystem into three broad categories: intelligent crop planning, smart farming, and data as an enabler.
3. The report highlights the AI for Agriculture Innovation (AI4AI) initiative, a public-private partnership aimed at scaling agritech services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report was released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the FAO.  While both organizations are involved in agricultural development, the authorship of this specific report is attributed to the WEF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report categorizes agritech's role into four broad categories, not three: intelligent crop planning, smart farming, farmgate-to-fork, and data as an enabler.  Missing one of the categories renders the statement inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The report directly discusses the WEF's AI4AI initiative and its goals regarding public-private partnerships and scaling agritech services.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the information presented in the report. The other options incorrectly attribute the report to the wrong organization and misrepresent the number of agritech categories discussed.


**3. With reference to the Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999, and UNESCO recognition, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GI Act, 1999, guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge related to agricultural products.
2.  UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage includes practices like Yoga and traditional agricultural systems.
3. The GI Act primarily focuses on protecting the geographical origin and associated qualities of goods, thereby safeguarding traditional knowledge related to their production.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GI Act, 1999, guarantees collective rights, not individual rights, over traditional knowledge associated with geographical indications.  This protection extends to groups or communities associated with the production of specific goods from a particular region.

Statement 2 is correct. UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage encompasses various practices, including Yoga and, significantly, traditional agricultural systems. This recognition highlights the importance of preserving traditional knowledge and practices.

Statement 3 is correct. The core purpose of the GI Act is to protect the geographical origin and unique qualities of goods, which often involves safeguarding the traditional knowledge embedded in their production methods. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are accurate, while statement 1 misrepresents the nature of the rights protected under the GI Act.


**4. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMGS NMP utilizes a proprietary software developed specifically for this project, ensuring data security and preventing unauthorized access.
2. The PMGS NMP integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN, to provide a comprehensive view of infrastructure projects.
3.  The PMGS NMP is driven by eight engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, Logistics Infrastructure, and Energy Infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PMGS NMP is built on open-source technology, not a proprietary software. This approach facilitates collaboration and accessibility.  The claim about data security is not directly contradicted, but the emphasis on open-source technology refutes the idea of a completely closed, proprietary system.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMP integrates data from various ministries involved in infrastructure projects, including those mentioned – Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN – to provide a holistic view of ongoing and planned initiatives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP is driven by seven engines, not eight.  The energy infrastructure is not explicitly listed among the driving forces of the plan.  Including an incorrect number of engines makes the statement false. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. The other options incorrectly include statements containing inaccurate information about the software used and the number of driving engines in the plan.


**5. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹8.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).
2. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
3. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP targets ₹6.0 lakh crore, not ₹8.0 lakh crore, over the four-year period.  A seemingly minor difference in the amount, but it's enough to render the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs does indeed hold responsibility for policy-level matters related to PPPs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not solely state-level projects. The committee's purview is at the central government level. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. The other options include statements that contain incorrect figures and misrepresent the scope of the appraisal committee.


**6. With reference to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agreement on Agriculture includes provisions on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies, but excludes any mention of public stockholding (PSH) policies.
2. The "de minimis" limits under the Agreement on Agriculture are calculated based on the reference price for 1996-98.
3. Developed countries have completely eliminated export subsidies as per the Nairobi Ministerial Decision 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Agreement on Agriculture does address public stockholding (PSH) policies, although it has been a source of ongoing debate and contention between developed and developing countries regarding its impact on trade.  The statement's omission of PSH from the agreement's scope is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "de minimis" limits are calculated based on the reference price for 1986-88, not 1996-98. This seemingly small difference in years significantly alters the calculation and makes the statement false.

Statement 3 is correct. Developed countries did eliminate export subsidies as per the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015.  This is a key aspect of the WTO's efforts to address trade distortions in the agricultural sector.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other options include statements that contain inaccuracies related to the scope of the agreement and the reference period for calculating de minimis limits.


**7. With reference to the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to curb harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of the world's fish stocks, focusing primarily on subsidies related to aquaculture.
2.  The agreement was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO.
3. The agreement includes provisions for a complete ban on all forms of fisheries subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the agreement aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion, it doesn't focus *primarily* on aquaculture subsidies.  Its scope is broader, encompassing various types of fisheries subsidies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement was adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference, not the 11th.  A single-digit error in the conference number renders the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The agreement doesn't call for a complete ban on *all* forms of fisheries subsidies.  It targets specific harmful subsidies while allowing for certain exceptions, particularly for developing countries.  Therefore, none of the statements are completely accurate.  Each statement contains a factual inaccuracy, making all options incorrect.  The question is designed to test the candidate's detailed understanding of the agreement's nuances.


**8. With reference to India's Digital Agriculture Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission's Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes data primarily from weather satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States.
2. The mission aims to create digital identities for 10 crore farmers over three years.
3.  The Agri Stack includes a Farmers' Registry component for issuing unique digital identities to farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) primarily uses data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS of the Department of Space (India), not NOAA satellites.  The source of the data is a crucial detail that distinguishes the statement as false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The mission aims to create digital identities for 11 crore farmers, not 10 crore.  This seemingly small numerical difference is enough to make the statement incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct. The Agri Stack indeed includes a Farmers' Registry component responsible for issuing unique digital identities to farmers, forming a key part of the Digital Agriculture Mission. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other options include statements containing factual inaccuracies regarding the source of data for the DSS and the total number of farmers targeted by the mission.


**9. With reference to the initiatives undertaken to improve India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses solely on increasing the milk production of indigenous bovine breeds, without considering other aspects of their welfare or conservation.
2. The National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) aims to control and eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, but not other animal diseases.
3. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are unified genomic chips developed to improve the traceability and genetic management of cattle and buffaloes, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims at the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, encompassing their productivity, genetic improvement, and overall welfare, not just milk production.  The statement's narrow focus on milk production is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NADCP focuses on controlling and eradicating FMD and Brucellosis, it also addresses other animal diseases as part of a broader effort to improve livestock health. The statement's limitation of the program's scope is incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are unified genomic chips designed for improved traceability and genetic management of cattle and buffaloes, respectively.  This is a key initiative to enhance livestock productivity and efficiency. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other options include statements that misrepresent the scope and goals of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission and the National Animal Disease Control Programme.


**10. With reference to India's agricultural exports and imports, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023-24, India's agricultural exports increased while imports decreased.
2.  India's share of agricultural exports in the world agriculture trade in 2022 was higher than its share of imports.
3. Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both agricultural exports and imports registered a decline in 2023-24, not an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. The statement incorrectly describes the trends in both export and import values.

Statement 2 is correct. India's share of agricultural exports in world agriculture trade in 2022 (2.4%) was indeed higher than its share of imports (1.9%), as per the WTO's Trade Statistical Review, 2023.

Statement 3 is correct. Rice did constitute the largest share (21%) of India's total agricultural exports in the period mentioned, exceeding other products like marine products and spices. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are accurate, while statement 1 contains an inaccurate description of the trends in agricultural exports and imports.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of India's position in the global agricultural trade.


**1. With reference to India's initiatives in the livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission primarily focuses on improving the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds through cross-breeding with exotic breeds to enhance milk yield.
2. The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) aims to eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis by 2025, focusing solely on vaccination drives.
3. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are unified genomic chips developed to track individual animals, enabling efficient disease surveillance and traceability throughout the supply chain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Rashtriya Gokul Mission's primary focus is on the *conservation* and *development* of indigenous bovine breeds, not necessarily through cross-breeding with exotic breeds. While improving productivity is a goal, the emphasis is on preserving genetic diversity and improving the overall quality of native breeds.  The mission aims to enhance breed purity and improve the genetic makeup of indigenous breeds, thereby bolstering their productivity in a sustainable manner.

Statement 2 is incorrect because, while the NADCP aims to control and eradicate FMD and Brucellosis, the timeline of 2025 is not explicitly stated and the program involves more than just vaccination, including improved disease surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, and farmer education.  It's a comprehensive approach, not solely reliant on vaccination.

Statement 3 is correct. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are indeed unified genomic chips designed to track individual animals, facilitating better disease surveillance, traceability, and overall management of the livestock population. This technology aids in enhancing the efficiency of the entire supply chain and helps in addressing issues like disease outbreaks more effectively.  The chips are integral to building a robust and modern livestock management system.


**2. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides short-term loans to individual farmers for purchasing agricultural machinery and implements, with a 5% interest subvention.
2. The AIF's eligible activities include the establishment of integrated primary and secondary processing projects, but exclude infrastructure development for community farming assets.
3.  The credit guarantee coverage under the AIF is exclusively provided by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. The AIF offers *medium- to long-term* debt financing, not short-term loans.  It focuses on post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets, not solely on individual farmer purchases of machinery. The interest subvention is 3%, not 5%.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the AIF *does* include viable projects for building community farming assets as eligible activities.  The expansion explicitly mentions this inclusion.  The statement misrepresents the scope of eligible projects.

Statement 3 is incorrect as the AIF credit guarantee coverage has been expanded to include NAB Sanrakshan (a wholly-owned subsidiary of NABARD) in addition to CGTMSE, thereby providing broader access to credit guarantees for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).


**3. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Global MPI (and consequently India's National MPI) uses five dimensions to assess poverty: health, education, living standards, environmental sustainability, and access to essential services.
2. The intensity of poverty (A) in the NMPI calculation represents the average proportion of deprivations experienced by multidimensionally poor individuals, while the headcount ratio (H) indicates the percentage of the population below the poverty line.
3.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021, utilizes data exclusively from the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) to measure multidimensional poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global MPI uses only *three* dimensions: health, education, and living standards.  The addition of environmental sustainability and access to essential services is inaccurate. The NMPI retains the same three dimensions.

Statement 2 is correct. The calculation of the NMPI accurately reflects the definitions of the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A) as described in the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMPI utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not solely the SECC.  The statement misidentifies the data source used for calculating the NMPI.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural export policy:**

1. India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2023-24.
2.  The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was primarily attributed to a global reduction in demand for Indian agricultural products due to international trade wars.
3. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is the nodal ministry responsible for formulating and implementing India's agricultural export policy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the target year mentioned is 2022, not 2023-24, indicating a misunderstanding of the timeline associated with the policy's targets.

Statement 2 is incorrect because while global factors can influence agricultural exports, the provided text doesn't attribute the decline solely to international trade wars.  Other factors, such as domestic supply chain issues or changes in global market dynamics, could have contributed to the decrease in exports. The statement presents an oversimplified and potentially inaccurate explanation for the decline.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the Ministry of Commerce and Industry plays a significant role in overall trade policy, the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is the primary agency responsible for formulating and implementing policies related to agricultural exports. The statement incorrectly assigns the responsibility to the wrong ministry.


**1. With reference to the Jute industry in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI), established in 1971, primarily focuses on promoting the export of jute products to international markets.
2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging for all agricultural commodities.
3. The JCI's Jute I-CARE project emphasizes the use of traditional farming methods to preserve the ecological integrity of jute cultivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While JCI does support the jute industry, its primary role is price support, not export promotion.  The JCI's activities are aimed at stabilizing jute prices and ensuring fair returns to farmers. The focus is on domestic market stability rather than solely on exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging for certain commodities, but not *all* agricultural commodities. The Act specifies particular items where jute packaging is compulsory, which excludes many agricultural products.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jute I-CARE project explicitly aims at *mechanization* in jute farming and accelerated retting using modern techniques like microbial consortium. This is a departure from traditional methods, focusing on efficiency and improved yield, not preservation of traditional practices.


**2. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, exclusively focuses on assessing the access of rural households to formal banking services, excluding other financial instruments.
2. The NAFINDEX, derived from NAFIS data, measures financial inclusion solely based on the number of bank accounts held by rural households.
3. The second NAFIS (2021-22) primarily analyzes changes in rural infrastructure since the first survey, neglecting financial inclusion aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS provides a comprehensive overview of rural populations' livelihoods and financial inclusion, encompassing loans, insurance, pensions, and other financial instruments, not just formal banking services.  It goes beyond simply assessing bank account access.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NAFINDEX uses NAFIS data, its measurement of financial inclusion is far more nuanced than just counting bank accounts. It considers multiple aspects of financial inclusion, including access to credit, insurance, and other financial services.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The second NAFIS offers key insights into economic and financial indicators of rural development *since* 2016-17, directly addressing changes in financial inclusion alongside other economic factors.  It's not solely focused on infrastructure.


**3. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) primarily serve as intermediaries, providing funds to PACS but not directly involved in their refinancing.
3.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and their operations are primarily confined to providing short-term credit to farmers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  They are *not* regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DCCBs play a crucial role in refinancing PACS, making them a key source of funds for the PACS’ operations.  Their role extends beyond simply providing funds; they are significantly involved in their financial sustainability.

Statement 3 is largely correct. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and their primary function is providing short-term credit. However, they are increasingly diversifying their activities beyond just credit, offering services such as input supply (seeds, fertilizers) to member farmers.


**4. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) considers any collateral-free loan exceeding ₹5,00,000 to low-income households as a microfinance loan.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides loans to individuals engaged in the agricultural sector.
3. The Malegam Committee's recommendations primarily focused on streamlining the process of loan disbursement by Microfinance Institutions (MFIs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households (annual income up to ₹3,00,000), not ₹5,00,000.  The limit is significantly lower than stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.  While some agricultural activities might qualify, it's not exclusively for the agricultural sector. It covers a broader range of small businesses.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Malegam Committee's recommendations focused on creating a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs to address issues of over-indebtedness, high interest rates, and unsustainable lending practices, going beyond mere loan disbursement.


**5. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are primarily responsible for directly lending to businesses facing financial distress, providing them with fresh capital to overcome their difficulties.
2. The establishment of ARCs was primarily recommended by the Narasimham Committee I (1991) report to address the issue of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).
3. ARCs are required to resolve the assets they acquire within a maximum of 5 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs purchase NPAs from banks and financial institutions, not directly lend to distressed businesses. Their role is to resolve the stressed assets, not to provide fresh capital.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Narasimham Committee II (1998) proposed the establishment of ARCs, not Committee I. The second committee's recommendations focused on strengthening the financial sector and addressing the growing NPA problem.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, of acquiring them. This timeframe allows for sufficient time to restructure and recover the assets.


**6. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The IBC mandates the completion of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) within a maximum of 270 days.
2. The Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) is the adjudicating authority for all types of insolvency cases, including corporate insolvency.
3.  The Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) is exclusively available for large corporate entities with defaults exceeding ₹100 crore.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC mandates completion of CIRP within 180 days, extendable to a maximum of 330 days, not 270 days.  The timeline is slightly different from what is stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While DRT handles individual or partnership insolvency, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is the adjudicating authority for corporate insolvency cases. The jurisdiction is clearly divided.

**9. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR, published annually by the World Bank, primarily focuses on economic indicators to assess human development.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities only in terms of reproductive health.
3. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the loss in Human Development Index (HDI) due to inequality but does not consider planetary pressures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  It uses a broader range of indicators beyond solely economic factors to assess human development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GII measures gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market, not solely reproductive health.  It incorporates a wider range of factors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IHDI reflects the loss in HDI due to inequality and the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI *does* consider planetary pressures to reflect a concern for intergenerational inequality.  The IHDI is distinct from the planetary pressures-adjusted HDI.


**10. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The MPI report, 2024, was published solely by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI).
2. The MPI measures poverty based solely on income levels, ignoring other dimensions of deprivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MPI report, 2024, was jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI, not solely by OPHI.  It's a collaborative effort between the two organizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MPI uses a multidimensional approach to measuring poverty, considering various deprivations beyond income, including health, education, and living standards. It goes beyond a purely income-based assessment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MPI report 2024 indicated that India had the *largest* number of people in extreme poverty, not the second largest.  This makes it a significant finding in the report.


**11. With reference to Monetary Policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1.  When the RBI buys government securities under Open Market Operations (OMO), it leads to a decrease in market liquidity.
2. An increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) generally leads to an increase in credit availability.
3. The Variable Repo Rate (VRR) is always higher than the Repo Rate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. When the RBI buys government securities, it injects liquidity into the market, increasing market liquidity, not decreasing it. This is a fundamental aspect of OMO.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing CRR and SLR reduces the funds available to banks for lending, thereby decreasing credit availability, not increasing it. This is a contractionary monetary policy tool.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The VRR is generally *lower* than the Repo Rate (but not below the Reverse Repo Rate). It's designed to provide liquidity at a rate more attractive to banks when market interest rates are lower than the Repo Rate.


**12. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and its related institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. ICAR-NISA was established in 2022 and is under the Ministry of Rural Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ICAR-NISA was established in 1924 (though renamed in 2022), and it falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The ministry is a significant difference.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of secondary agriculture mentioned includes beekeeping, poultry farming, *and* agricultural tourism as examples of agriculture-related value addition.  It encompasses a wider scope.

Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of ICAR (formerly the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research) on July 16, 1929, was indeed a direct outcome of the recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Agriculture (1928).  This is a well-established fact.


**13. With reference to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), consider the following statements:**

1. The PLFS, launched in 2017, is conducted annually to estimate employment and unemployment indicators only at the national level.
2. According to the PLFS, the unemployment rate for the calendar year 2023 was significantly higher than the global average unemployment rate.
3. The PLFS collects data on various aspects of employment, including the types of employment, the sector of employment and the demographic profile of the workforce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PLFS is conducted quarterly, not annually, to provide more timely and updated insights into employment trends.  It also provides state-level data alongside national level data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PLFS data for 2023 showed a lower unemployment rate (3.1%) compared to the global average (5.1%).  The statement misrepresents the actual findings.

Statement 3 is correct. The PLFS collects comprehensive data on various aspects of the labour force, covering employment types, sectors, and demographic characteristics of the employed and unemployed population.  It provides a detailed picture of the workforce.


**14. With reference to wilful default in loan repayment, consider the following statements:**

1. A wilful default occurs only when a borrower completely fails to make any payment towards the loan, irrespective of their repayment capacity.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines a large defaulter as one with an outstanding amount of ₹50 lakh and above.
3.  Lenders are not required to establish an Identification Committee to examine evidence of wilful default.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A wilful default involves not only the failure to pay but also the presence of factors indicating the borrower's capacity to pay but a deliberate refusal to do so (e.g., diversion of funds, disposal of assets).  It's not simply about non-payment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI defines a large defaulter as one with an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above, not ₹50 lakh. The threshold is considerably higher.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Lenders are *required* to establish an Identification Committee to thoroughly examine the evidence and determine whether a default is wilful or not.  This is a crucial step in the process.



**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PMMSY indeed targets 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, reflecting the government's focus on expanding seaweed cultivation as a sustainable and economically viable activity.  This is a key objective aimed at boosting the overall fisheries sector's contribution to the GDP.

Statement 2 is also correct.  PMMSY promotes the development of Integrated Aquaparks and the adoption of modern technologies such as RAS and biofloc technology to enhance efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture practices. These aquaparks are designed to integrate various fisheries-related activities in a single location, improving overall productivity and reducing environmental impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Rangeen Machhli app does provide multilingual information on ornamental fish species, it's not a direct component of PMMSY.  It's a separate initiative under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Yojana, a sub-scheme under the broader PMMSY umbrella, but not a defining feature of PMMSY itself.  The app addresses a niche market within the ornamental fish segment, while PMMSY has a wider scope encompassing various aspects of the fisheries sector.  Therefore, attributing the app directly to PMMSY is a factual inaccuracy.

1. The NMP aims to generate ₹6.0 lakh crore in investment over a five-year period (FY22 to FY26) by monetising government assets.
2. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is the primary body responsible for policy-level matters concerning Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), including the NMP.
3. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates all central sector PPP projects, including those under the NMP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's target investment generation is ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  This discrepancy in the timeframe demonstrates the importance of precise information in understanding the scope and objectives of government initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in shaping policies and strategies related to PPPs, encompassing the NMP. Its role in overseeing policy-level aspects is vital for the successful implementation of the NMP.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, its purview does not encompass all projects under the NMP. The NMP involves a wider range of asset monetization strategies that may not always fall under the direct purview of this committee.  This illustrates the need to understand the distinct roles and responsibilities of different government bodies in the implementation of large-scale economic initiatives.

ADeX holds key datasets including farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown.  This information is crucial for various agricultural services and policy interventions. Statement 3 is also incorrect. ADeX is a data exchange platform, not a direct sales platform for agricultural produce. It provides the underlying data that can be *used* by other systems to facilitate such sales, but that is not its primary function. The core purpose of ADeX is to consolidate and share vital agricultural data to improve efficiency and decision-making across the agricultural value chain.  By providing a centralized repository of farmer and crop information, ADeX enables better targeting of government schemes, facilitates more informed credit decisions, and supports improved agricultural planning and resource allocation.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes ADeX's functionality.

3. The MSP covers only the major Kharif crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MSP sets a floor price, farmers are not obligated to sell at that price. They are free to sell in the open market if they can get a better price. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CACP considers various factors, including production costs (A2, A2+FL, and C2 costs), market prices, and international prices, to recommend MSPs, not just market prices alone. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The MSP covers a broader range of crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops, and some commercial crops. The MSP mechanism aims to safeguard farmers from distress sales and provide them with a minimum guaranteed price for their produce. The CACP's recommendations are based on a comprehensive analysis of several economic factors to ensure that the MSP is both viable for farmers and sustainable for the government.  The government's final decision on MSP is influenced by considerations of budgetary constraints, consumer prices, and overall macroeconomic conditions. Therefore, all three statements are incorrect.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is likely correct, but the phrasing is too absolute. While the MoA&FW is the primary driver, collaboration with other agencies is possible. Statement 2 is incorrect. ICCC uses AI, remote sensing, *and* GIS for a comprehensive analysis.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While weather data is a component, ICCC's role is broader; it aims for informed decision-making using multiple technological inputs. The ICCC uses technology to integrate and analyze diverse data sources related to agriculture, including weather patterns, soil conditions, crop health, and market information. This integrated approach enables the ICCC to provide comprehensive insights to policymakers and stakeholders for more effective decision-making. The ICCC supports informed policy formulation, resource allocation, and efficient implementation of agricultural programs. It also plays a role in disaster preparedness and response by providing timely alerts and information to farmers and officials.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India's average annual cattle productivity is lower than the world average. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions FMD as a cause of significant economic losses in the Indian livestock sector. Statement 3 is correct. The ‘Gau Chip’ and ‘Mahish Chip’ are indeed initiatives focused on improving traceability and management of cattle and buffalo populations. The development of these genomic chips represents a significant step towards modernizing the Indian livestock sector and addressing challenges related to disease control and productivity improvement.   Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI defines microfinance loans based on income thresholds, the interest rate is not the sole criterion.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI is the primary regulatory body for MFIs in India. Statement 3 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to a broader category of small and micro enterprises, not exclusively microfinance loans. Microfinance institutions play a crucial role in providing financial services to marginalized and low-income individuals who lack access to formal banking channels.  The RBI's regulatory framework aims to ensure the responsible growth and stability of the microfinance sector while protecting the interests of borrowers and promoting financial inclusion.  The PMMY complements microfinance initiatives by providing additional avenues for access to credit for small businesses. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index incorporates various factors beyond bank accounts, including investments, insurance, postal services, and pensions. Statement 2 is correct. A higher FI-Index score indicates a greater level of financial inclusion across different dimensions. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the FI-Index is published annually, not bi-annually. The Financial Inclusion Index provides a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which individuals and households have access to and utilize financial services.  It helps policymakers understand the progress made in achieving financial inclusion and identify areas needing improvement. The index's multi-dimensional nature ensures a holistic view of financial inclusion, going beyond simple metrics like bank account penetration to capture the depth and breadth of financial service usage. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RB-IOS covers a broader range of grievances related to services provided by various regulated entities, not only credit card disputes. Statement 2 is correct. The scheme explicitly aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints. Statement 3 is incorrect. RB-IOS covers only NBFCs with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above, not all NBFCs.  The RB-IOS is a significant initiative to strengthen the alternate grievance redressal mechanism in the financial sector. By providing a cost-effective and accessible platform for resolving customer complaints, the scheme promotes transparency, accountability, and consumer protection. The scheme's coverage encompasses a wide range of financial institutions, ensuring that a large segment of the population has access to an effective grievance redressal mechanism.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs has no role in PPP policy.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the Private Investment Unit plays a crucial role in policy-level matters concerning PPPs. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not just state-level ones. Statement 3 is correct. The NMP is specifically designed to generate investment through the monetization of existing government assets. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a crucial mechanism for infrastructure development in India, combining the strengths of both the public and private sectors.  The government plays a key role in setting the policy framework, regulating the PPP process, and ensuring transparency and accountability.

**12. With reference to Asset Monetization (AM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Asset Monetization was first recommended by the Vijay Kelkar Committee in 2012.
2. Asset Monetization involves only the outright sale of government assets.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) focuses exclusively on the privatization of public sector undertakings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the Vijay Kelkar committee first recommended AM in 2012. Statement 2 is incorrect. AM involves various methods, including licensing, leasing, and concessions, not just outright sales. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP focuses on monetizing brownfield infrastructure assets, not solely on privatizing public sector undertakings. Asset monetization is a strategic approach to unlock the value of underutilized public assets and generate revenue for government entities.  The process involves various mechanisms, such as long-term leases, concessions, and joint ventures, which allow the private sector to manage and operate public assets while generating revenue streams for the government.  The NMP represents a significant initiative to leverage asset monetization for infrastructure development and fiscal consolidation. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) is a medium-to-long-term debt financing facility, not short-term as stated in statement 1.  The interest subvention offered under AIF is 3%, not 5% per annum for loans up to ₹2 Crores (statement 2). Finally, AIF is not solely funded by the Central Government; it involves loans provided by banks and financial institutions with interest subvention and credit guarantee support from the government (statement 3). Therefore, none of the statements are correct.  The AIF's purpose is to improve post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets, a critical aspect of enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing post-harvest losses. The interest subvention incentivizes lending institutions to participate, making credit more accessible to farmers.  The program's success depends on the effective collaboration between the government and financial institutions.

1. Rice constitutes the highest percentage of India's agricultural exports.
2. Vegetable oil constitutes the lowest percentage of India's agricultural imports.
3. India's share of world agricultural exports is over 5% according to the WTO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While rice is a significant agricultural export for India, it does not constitute the highest percentage.  Marine products hold a larger share (statement 1). Vegetable oil constitutes a significant, and not the lowest, percentage of India's agricultural imports (statement 2).  According to the WTO, India's share of world agricultural exports is 2.4%, significantly less than 5% (statement 3).  The data highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural exports beyond rice and the need to address the high dependence on imported vegetable oils. The relatively low share in global trade underscores the need for strategic interventions to boost India's presence in the international agricultural market.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rashtriya Gokul Mission primarily focuses on the development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, not exotic breeds (statement 2). While improving milk quality is a desirable outcome, it's not the primary objective of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (statement 1). The National Programme for Dairy Development is a separate initiative, not a component of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission (statement 3). The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to preserve the genetic diversity of Indian cattle breeds and improve their productivity, contributing to the overall growth of the dairy sector.  The focus on indigenous breeds reflects a strategy to leverage India's unique genetic resources for sustainable dairy development.

1. MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture.
3. MSP currently covers 22 crops, including both Kharif and Rabi crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MSP is announced at the beginning, not the end, of the sowing season to provide farmers with price certainty (statement 1). The final decision on MSPs is taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not solely the Ministry of Agriculture (statement 2).  Statement 3 accurately reflects the number of crops covered under the MSP scheme. The MSP mechanism aims to protect farmers from distress sales and ensure remunerative prices for their produce.  The CCEA's role in the final decision-making process underlines the importance of MSP as a crucial government policy.


**8. With reference to India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR), consider the following statements:**

1. The SPR program is managed by ONGC.
2.  The SPR currently has a total storage capacity exceeding 10 million metric tonnes.
3. The SPR includes storage facilities in Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru, and Padur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SPR program is managed by the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL), not ONGC (statement 1).  The current total storage capacity of the SPR is 5.33 million metric tonnes, not exceeding 10 million metric tonnes (statement 2). Statement 3 correctly identifies the locations of SPR storage facilities. The SPR program is a crucial element of India's energy security strategy, providing a buffer against supply disruptions and price volatility in the global oil market.  The expansion of SPR capacity is an ongoing process to enhance energy resilience.

1. The NMP targets ₹10 lakh crore over four years.
2. The NMP includes monetization of assets in the power sector.
3. The NMP is primarily focused on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹10 lakh crore, over four years (statement 1).  The power sector is indeed among the sectors included in the NMP (statement 2). While attracting investment is a goal, the NMP is not exclusively focused on FDI; it also aims to generate domestic investment (statement 3). The NMP is a significant initiative aimed at unlocking the value of underutilized government assets and generating revenue for infrastructure development.  The inclusion of various sectors reflects a comprehensive approach to asset monetization.

3.  Seaweed farming has no significant role in carbon sequestration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Seaweed cultivation is a part of aquaculture, not sericulture (statement 1). Statement 2 correctly states the target of the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana regarding seaweed production. Seaweed farming plays a significant role in carbon sequestration, not insignificant as stated in statement 3.  Seaweed cultivation has emerged as a promising area for sustainable development, offering economic and environmental benefits.  The target set by the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana reflects the government's commitment to promoting seaweed farming as a valuable economic activity and a tool for climate change mitigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ADeX does use geotagged data, its primary function is not weather updates but rather compiling farmer identity, farm location, and crop-sown data for better service delivery.  It's a data exchange platform, not a real-time weather forecasting tool.  Statement 2 is correct. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) directly uses space technology and GIS for improved yield estimation. This is a core component of its design. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The ICCC utilizes a combination of technologies, including artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), for a more comprehensive approach to agricultural decision-making. It doesn't rely solely on AI. The integration of multiple technologies is crucial for its effectiveness and accuracy.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the initiatives' functionalities.

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) determines the MSP for all agricultural commodities, including livestock products.
2.  The MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure accurate price assessment.
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole procuring agency responsible for purchasing all MSP-covered crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs,  it primarily focuses on crops.  Livestock products are not directly under the MSP system. The final decision on MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. Statement 2 is incorrect. The MSP is announced at the *beginning* of the sowing season to help farmers plan their planting. This timing is crucial for providing price certainty before the farming cycle begins. Statement 3 is incorrect. Although FCI is a major procurer for wheat and paddy, it is not the *sole* agency responsible for all MSP-covered crops. Other agencies and state governments also participate in procurement. Therefore, all three statements contain inaccuracies.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's agricultural exports consistently exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion set by the 2018 policy.
2. Rice and marine products together account for over 50% of India's total agricultural exports.
3. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) primarily focuses on improving domestic market access for agricultural products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target. This directly contradicts the statement. Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice and marine products are significant contributors, their combined share is less than 50% of total agricultural exports.  The text indicates rice constitutes 21% and marine products 15%, totaling 36%. Statement 3 is incorrect. TIES aims to improve *export* infrastructure, such as border haats, land custom stations, and cold chains, not primarily domestic market access.  Therefore, all three statements are factually incorrect.


**4. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to exclusively monetize newly constructed government assets.
2. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides 100% of project costs as a capital grant.
3. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first proposed asset monetization in 2012.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP targets existing, "brownfield" government assets, not exclusively new ones.  Monetizing existing infrastructure is a key goal to unlock value and generate revenue. Statement 2 is incorrect. The VGF provides up to 40%, not 100%, of project costs as a capital grant to improve project viability.  This is a crucial point highlighting the partial funding nature of the scheme. Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended asset monetization in 2012. This is a well-established fact related to the genesis of the policy.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**5. With reference to India's Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Financial Stability Report (FSR) indicated a rise in Scheduled Commercial Banks' Gross NPAs at the end of March 2024.
2. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, is primarily designed to resolve stressed assets below ₹500 crore.
3.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, allows secured creditors to seize collateral in case of loan defaults.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FSR, as mentioned in the text, highlighted a *fall* in Gross NPAs to multi-year lows, contradicting the statement. Statement 2 is incorrect. The IBC is designed to handle stressed assets *above* a certain threshold (though not specifically ₹500 crore as stated), aiming for reorganization and resolution of larger corporate defaults.  The text mentions the National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) for resolving stressed assets *above* ₹500 crore, suggesting a higher threshold for IBC involvement. Statement 3 is correct. The SARFAESI Act empowers secured creditors with the ability to take possession of collateral upon loan repayment default. This is a key aspect of the act.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**6. With reference to the Microfinance sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans to women entrepreneurs.
2.  The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) involved in microfinance.
3. All collateral-free loans to low-income households are automatically classified as microfinance loans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, not exclusively to women entrepreneurs.  While women entrepreneurs are eligible, the scheme is broader in its scope. Statement 2 is correct. The Malegam Committee's recommendations directly addressed the need for regulating NBFC-MFIs, a significant contribution to the sector's governance. Statement 3 is partially correct; it needs clarification.  The RBI defines microfinance loans based on factors beyond just collateral, including the income level of the borrower.  It's not an automatic classification based solely on collateral. The definition given in the text is accurate but would require further interpretation. However, we can still consider this statement correct in the context of the provided information since the statement is true according to the text. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans with interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage, not 100% grant funding.  This is a key distinction between grant and loan-based assistance. Statement 2 is correct. The recent expansion of AIF explicitly includes integrated processing projects, expanding the scope of eligible activities. Statement 3 is incorrect. While CGTMSE is involved, NABARD's subsidiary, NAB Sanrakshan, has also been brought in to extend credit guarantee coverage.  This highlights the diversification of credit guarantee providers. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the AIF's features.


**8. With reference to India’s  livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India ranks first globally in the use of antibiotics in animals.
2. The average annual productivity of cattle in India surpasses the world average.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India ranks fourth, not first, in antibiotic use in animals, according to the provided text. This is a significant factual error. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the average annual productivity of cattle in India (1777 kg/animal/year) is lower than the world average (2699 kg/animal/year). This highlights a productivity gap. Statement 3 is correct.  The development of the "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" for cattle and buffaloes, respectively, by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is accurately mentioned in the text.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

1. India possesses the world's largest technical textiles market.
2. The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as a global leader in technical textiles.
3. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles excludes technical textiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India's technical textiles market is the fifth largest globally, not the largest.  This is a crucial factual detail. Statement 2 is correct. The National Technical Textiles Mission explicitly aims to position India as a global leader in this sector.  This is a stated objective of the mission. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions the PLI scheme for textiles *including* technical textiles as a supportive initiative.  This indicates its inclusion, not exclusion.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**10. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI comprises ten core industries, contributing 50% of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2. Petroleum Refinery Products hold the lowest weight in the ICI.
3. The Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, releases the ICI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICI includes eight, not ten, core industries, and contributes 40.27%, not 50%, to the IIP.  These are key numerical discrepancies. Statement 2 is incorrect. Petroleum Refinery Products have the *highest* weight (28.04%) in the ICI, not the lowest. This is a direct contradiction of the fact. Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly states that the Office of the Economic Adviser releases the ICI. This is a standard procedure and fact. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**1. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) recommended the establishment of ARCs, modeled after similar asset management companies globally.
2. ARCs are mandated to resolve acquired financial assets within a maximum of 5 years, after which security receipts must be redeemed.
3.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates ARCs under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II, in 1998, indeed proposed the establishment of ARCs in India, drawing inspiration from international models of asset management companies. This recommendation aimed to address the growing problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in the Indian banking system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ARCs are required to resolve assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, of acquisition.  The timeframe is crucial for effective asset resolution and the subsequent redemption of security receipts representing these assets.  A shorter timeframe might be unrealistic for many complex cases.

Statement 3 is correct. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, provides the legal framework for the operation and regulation of ARCs in India. The RBI, as the primary regulator of financial institutions, plays a vital role in overseeing ARCs' activities to ensure they operate within the legal and regulatory boundaries and maintain financial stability.  The act's provisions ensure the proper functioning of ARCs and their role in resolving stressed assets.


**2. With reference to the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. PPIRP was introduced in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, through an amendment enacted in 2020.
2.  PPIRP is available for corporate Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with defaults exceeding ₹1 crore.
3. PPIRP mandates a formal process throughout its duration, ensuring transparency and adherence to legal procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PPIRP was introduced through an amendment to the IBC, 2016, this amendment took place in 2021, not 2020.  The precise timing of legislative changes is crucial in understanding the regulatory landscape and the evolution of insolvency resolution mechanisms in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PPIRP is indeed for corporate MSMEs, but the default threshold is at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹1 crore.  The difference between these figures is significant, affecting the scope and applicability of PPIRP to a wider range of MSMEs.  A higher threshold would exclude many smaller businesses facing financial distress.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PPIRP is a hybrid process, with a largely informal pre-initiation phase and a formal post-initiation stage. The informal phase allows for quicker resolution and flexibility, while the formal stage ensures transparency and adherence to legal processes.  The dual nature of the process is a key feature of PPIRP, distinguishing it from other insolvency resolution methods.


**3. With reference to the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets exceeding ₹500 crore are subject to scale-based regulation.
2.  NBFCs can accept demand deposits like commercial banks, but are subject to stricter regulatory oversight.
3.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insures deposits made in NBFCs up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The scale-based regulation (SBR) for NBFCs categorizes them into tiers based on their size, activity, and risk profile.  The asset size threshold of ₹100 crore and above triggers the application of SBR. The threshold mentioned in the statement is incorrect. This tiered approach allows for a more nuanced regulatory framework, tailoring the requirements to the specific characteristics of different NBFCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key distinction between NBFCs and banks is that NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits.  This difference is fundamental to their nature and operations.  This restriction is a critical aspect of regulating NBFCs to prevent systemic risk.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  DICGC insurance coverage does not extend to deposits in NBFCs.  This lack of deposit insurance protection is another key difference between NBFCs and banks.  Depositors in NBFCs bear a higher level of risk compared to those in banks.


**4. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) effective from April 1, 2024.
2.  All UCBs, regardless of tier, are subject to the PCA framework, except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the key parameters monitored under the PCA framework for UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The effective date of the new PCA framework for UCBs is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  Precision in dates is essential when discussing regulatory changes and their implementation timelines.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework applies to UCBs in tiers 2, 3, and 4, excluding those under AID.  The statement incorrectly implies universal applicability.  The tiered approach ensures that the regulatory intensity is aligned with the risk profiles of different UCBs.

Statement 3 is correct. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are indeed the core parameters monitored under the PCA framework.  These parameters provide a comprehensive assessment of a UCB's financial health and stability.  The focus on these parameters is crucial for early intervention and preventing potential financial distress.


**5. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI working group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.
3. NUCFDC's major functions include providing liquidity and capital support, ensuring regulatory compliance, and developing a shared technology platform for UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  The distinction between Type I and Type II NBFC-NDs is significant in terms of regulatory requirements and operational scope.  This detail highlights the importance of understanding the specific classification of financial institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The need for an umbrella organization was first highlighted by an RBI working group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006, not V.S. Das.  The correct attribution of authorship is essential for accurate historical context and understanding the evolution of policy initiatives.  The report by Shri V.S. Das working group came in 2009.

Statement 3 is correct.  NUCFDC's core functions indeed include providing liquidity and capital support, facilitating regulatory compliance, and developing a shared technology platform. These functions are crucial for strengthening the UCB sector and improving its efficiency and resilience.  The breadth of its functions demonstrates the comprehensive approach to supporting UCBs.



**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST is a direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services, replacing various indirect taxes.
2. The GST Council, a constitutional body, is responsible for setting tax rates and making policy decisions related to GST, with the Union Finance Minister as its Chairperson.  A three-fourths majority of weighted votes is required for decision-making.
3. The GST Appellate Tribunal is the first appellate authority for hearing appeals against orders passed by the tax authorities under the CGST and SGST Acts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GST is an *indirect* tax, not a direct tax. Direct taxes are levied directly on the income or profits of individuals or corporations (e.g., income tax, corporate tax), while indirect taxes are levied on the sale or consumption of goods and services (e.g., GST, excise duty).  The GST indeed replaced various indirect taxes, but its fundamental nature remains indirect.

Statement 2 is correct. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A, responsible for setting tax rates and policies. The Union Finance Minister chairs it, and decisions require a three-fourths majority of weighted votes, reflecting the federal structure of India's tax system.  The weighted voting system gives states a significant voice.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a *second* appellate authority, not the first.  The first appeal typically goes to the designated appellate authority under the CGST and SGST Acts before reaching the Tribunal.  The structure is designed for a multi-level appeal process in tax disputes.


**2. With reference to Excise Duty and its relationship with GST, consider the following statements:**

1.  Prior to the implementation of GST, excise duty was levied only on goods manufactured outside India.
2. Post-GST, excise duty is levied on all goods and services except those specifically exempted by the GST Council.
3. State Excise duty is levied on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances by the State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Before the GST, central excise duty was levied on goods *manufactured within India* for domestic consumption.  Customs duty, on the other hand, applied to goods imported from outside the country.  The question attempts to confuse the reader by interchanging excise and customs duties.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GST subsumed many types of excise duty, significantly reducing its scope.  Post-GST, excise duty applies primarily to petroleum products and alcohol (which is a state subject). The statement falsely suggests a broader application of excise duty.

Statement 3 is correct. State Excise duty is a significant revenue source for state governments, specifically levied on alcohol and narcotics, which are outside the purview of the central GST.


**3. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) and its implications, consider the following statements:**

1. IDS occurs when the GST rate on finished goods exceeds the GST rate on input goods.
2. IDS leads to a blockage of working capital for taxpayers due to higher input tax credits and potential refund delays.
3.  IDS benefits domestic industries by making their products more competitive in the export market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDS occurs when the GST rate on *input* goods is higher than the GST rate on *finished* goods, the opposite of what the statement claims. This creates a situation where the input tax credit is more than the output tax liability.

Statement 2 is correct.  IDS creates a significant problem for businesses.  Because input tax is higher than output tax, businesses have a large input tax credit that remains unutilized, tying up their working capital and creating complexities in claiming refunds.  This can lead to cash flow issues and financial difficulties.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  IDS *harms* domestic industries.  The higher cost of inputs due to higher GST rates on those inputs makes domestic products more expensive, reducing their competitiveness in both the domestic and export markets.


**4. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax and recent amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Bill, 2024, introduced indexation benefits for immovable properties acquired after July 23, 2024.
2. The amendment abolishes indexation benefits for properties acquired before July 23, 2024, as a retrospective measure.
3. The grandfather clause allows properties acquired before July 23, 2024, to continue benefiting from indexation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendment *removed* indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* July 23, 2024, not introduced them.  The question attempts to confuse the reader by reversing the timeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amendment did not apply retrospectively to properties acquired before July 23, 2024.  It only changed the rules for future acquisitions.

Statement 3 is correct. The grandfather clause is a common feature of tax legislation. It protects existing situations from the impact of new rules, ensuring a smooth transition and preventing unfair retrospective application.  In this case, it protects those who acquired properties before the cutoff date.


**5. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is a private financial institution established under the Companies Act, 2013, primarily focused on short-term infrastructure financing.
2. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3. The entire shareholding of NaBFID is currently held by the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. NaBFID is a *public* financial institution, not private, established under a specific Act (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021), not the Companies Act, 2013.  It focuses on *long-term* infrastructure financing, not short-term.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  This reflects its role as a financial institution dealing with infrastructure finance.  SEBI regulates the securities market.

Statement 3 is correct. The entire shareholding of NaBFID remains with the Government of India, indicating its role as a government-owned development financial institution.


**6. With reference to India's e-commerce sector and related policies, consider the following statements:**

1.  In the inventory-based e-commerce model, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted under the automatic route in India.
2. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create a platform-centric e-commerce ecosystem.
3. The Draft e-Commerce Policy aims to create a facilitative regulatory environment for the growth of the e-commerce sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In the inventory-based e-commerce model, FDI is *not* permitted in India to protect the domestic retail sector.  Only the marketplace model allows 100% FDI under the automatic route.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ONDC uses a *network-centric* model, not a platform-centric one.  A network-centric approach aims for interoperability and decentralization, unlike the platform-centric model where a single platform dominates.

Statement 3 is correct. The Draft e-Commerce Policy aims to create a regulatory framework that supports the growth of the e-commerce sector while addressing concerns related to competition, consumer protection, and data privacy.


**7. With reference to the Equalisation Levy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The equalisation levy was initially introduced in 2016 at a rate of 2% on all online transactions.
2. In 2020, the scope of the equalisation levy was extended to cover e-commerce supplies or services to Indian residents by non-resident e-commerce operators.
3. The purpose of the equalisation levy is to ensure fair competition between domestic and foreign e-commerce businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial rate of the equalisation levy was 6%, not 2%, and it was applied to online advertisements and related payments, not all online transactions.  The question plays on the fact that the levy was later reduced.

Statement 2 is correct. The scope of the equalisation levy was indeed expanded in 2020 to include e-commerce supplies to Indian residents by non-resident operators, aiming to tax digital transactions more comprehensively.

Statement 3 is correct. The levy aims to create a level playing field between domestic and foreign businesses operating in the digital space, preventing tax avoidance and ensuring fair competition.  It's designed to ensure that foreign companies pay their fair share of taxes in India.


**8. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. A DTAA is an agreement between two countries to avoid double taxation on the same income in both countries.
2. The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA included the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to prevent treaty abuse.
3. The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism to resolve double taxation disputes under DTAAs but only those of a juridical nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DTAAs are designed to prevent double taxation, a common problem for individuals and businesses with income or assets in multiple countries.  They allocate taxing rights between countries to avoid double taxation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA incorporated the PPT to prevent treaty shopping, a practice where companies structure transactions to take advantage of tax benefits in one country while conducting business primarily elsewhere.  The PPT aims to ensure the benefits are aligned with the actual economic activity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MAP can resolve double taxation disputes that are *both* juridical and economic in nature. The statement tries to limit the scope of MAP.


**9. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs were first introduced in India in 2002 through the SARFAESI Act.
2. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum period of 5 years of acquisition.
3. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) recommended establishing ARCs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, provided the legal framework for the establishment and operation of ARCs in India, though the concept was suggested earlier.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, to resolve the assets they acquire.  This longer timeframe allows for a more comprehensive resolution strategy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) recognized the need for ARCs to address the problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in Indian banks and recommended their establishment.  The committee's recommendations laid the groundwork for the later SARFAESI Act.


**10. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI was established in 2009 under the Competition Act, 2002.
2. The CCI is composed of a Chairperson and not more than four other Members.
3. The CCI operates under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CCI was indeed established in 2009 under the Competition Act, 2002, to promote competition and prevent anti-competitive practices in the Indian market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CCI has a Chairperson and *not less than two and not more than six* other Members, not just four.  The question manipulates the number of members.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CCI operates under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  This reflects its focus on corporate regulations and competition law.


**11. With reference to the Coal sector in India and its challenges, consider the following statements:**

1. India has a high import dependence on coking coal due to the low ash content of domestically produced coking coal.
2. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, permitted the auction of coal mines only for captive use by private entities.
3. Coal India Limited (CIL) contributes more than 90% of India's indigenous coal production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India heavily relies on imports for high-quality coking coal because domestically produced coking coal has a high ash content, making it less suitable for steel production.  This creates a vulnerability in the steel industry's supply chain.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, allowed the auction of coal mines for *commercial mining* by private entities, not just for captive use.  The question restricts the scope of the Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While CIL is a dominant player, its contribution to India's indigenous coal production is around 80%, not more than 90%.  The question exaggerates CIL's market share.


**12. With reference to Indian Railways safety and initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. In the last 5 years, over 80% of railway accidents involved derailments.
2. The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) is a fund dedicated to upgrading railway signalling systems.
3. The KAVACH system is an indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is close but slightly inaccurate.  The provided text states that 75% of railway accidents involved derailments in the last 5 years, not over 80%.  The question slightly alters a factual figure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RRSK is a fund for upgrading *critical railway safety infrastructure*, which includes but is not limited to signalling systems.  The question overly specifies the RRSK's purpose.

Statement 3 is correct. KAVACH is indeed an indigenous ATP system designed to enhance railway safety by preventing collisions and derailments.  It's a significant technological advancement in Indian Railways.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The seven engines are a core component of the PM GatiShakti initiative, aiming for integrated infrastructure development across various modes of transport.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan uses *open-source technology*, not proprietary software. This is a key aspect of its design, promoting transparency and accessibility.

Statement 3 is correct. A major feature of the plan is its integration of data from various ministries, providing a comprehensive view of ongoing and planned infrastructure projects.  This helps in better coordination and avoiding duplication of efforts.


**14. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Ministry of Finance is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs is located in the *Department of Economic Affairs*, not the Ministry of Finance. The question misplaces the unit within the government structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a vital role in evaluating the viability and feasibility of PPP projects undertaken by the central government.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMP aims to *increase* private sector participation through monetization of existing government assets.  The question incorrectly portrays the NMP's objective.  It seeks to attract private investment into infrastructure.


**15. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty is the first WIPO treaty to address the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK).
2. The treaty is legally binding on all member states of WIPO immediately upon adoption.
3. The treaty acknowledges the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The treaty represents a significant step in addressing the complex interplay between intellectual property rights, access to genetic resources, and the protection of traditional knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The treaty comes into force three months after 15 parties ratify it, not immediately upon adoption. This is a standard process for international treaties.

Statement 3 is correct. The treaty explicitly acknowledges UNDRIP, reflecting the growing international emphasis on the rights and participation of indigenous communities in matters related to their traditional knowledge and genetic resources.  This recognition is crucial for the ethical and equitable implementation of the treaty.

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) indeed leverages a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, utilizing a GIS platform and integrating data from ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.  This integration is crucial for comprehensive spatial planning and infrastructure development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti approach explicitly includes seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  Omitting mass transport and logistics infrastructure misrepresents the plan's scope.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP explicitly aims to provide a comprehensive database of ongoing and future projects from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, and UDAN.  Excluding inland waterways is factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for all aspects of PPP implementation, including project execution.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in policy-level matters concerning PPPs, it does not handle all aspects of implementation, including project execution.  Project execution involves various other government agencies and private partners.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  The statement incorrectly limits its scope to state-level projects.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) indeed aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25). This initiative is a key strategy for attracting private investment in infrastructure.


**3. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds, but they primarily focus on investments in the agricultural sector.
2.  The SEBI amendments to InvIT Regulations 2024 allow for the issuance of subordinate units by all InvITs, regardless of placement.
3.  Sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs primarily focus on infrastructure projects such as toll roads, power lines, and pipelines, not the agricultural sector.  This statement misrepresents the core investment area of InvITs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SEBI amendments allow for the issuance of subordinate units by privately placed InvITs *only* to the sponsors upon acquisition of an infrastructure project. The statement incorrectly broadens this restriction.

Statement 3 is correct. Sponsors setting up InvITs through SEBI are indeed recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. This legal recognition is crucial for the functioning of InvITs.


**4. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are financial institutions that primarily deal with purchasing performing assets from banks.
2. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.
3. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) proposed the establishment of ARCs, drawing inspiration from asset management companies globally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs purchase Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions, not performing assets.  This is a fundamental aspect of their function in cleaning up bank balance sheets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ARCs are required to resolve assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, of acquisition. This timeframe is crucial for effective asset resolution and recovery.

Statement 3 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) did indeed propose the establishment of ARCs, based on the model of asset management companies prevalent globally.  This committee played a vital role in shaping the regulatory framework for ARCs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MSP covers 22 crops, not 25, and includes 14 Kharif crops, not 15. The number of crops and the specific Kharif crop count are both factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Finance Minister. The decision-making authority is a crucial detail.

Statement 3 is incorrect. FCI is the nodal agency for wheat and paddy, not all MSP-covered crops.  The statement incorrectly broadens FCI's procurement responsibility.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC mandates completion of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) within 180 days, extendable to 330 days, not 90 days. The timeframe is a critical aspect of the code's efficiency.

Statement 2 is correct. Information Utilities (IUs) do indeed play a crucial role in collecting, authenticating, and disseminating financial information to facilitate the insolvency resolution process.  This data is essential for informed decision-making.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Appeals against NCLT orders are heard by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), not the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal.  The correct appellate authority is crucial for understanding the legal process.



**1. With reference to India's seaweed farming, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation contributes significantly to India's GDP, exceeding 5% of the national total.
2.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2030.
3.  The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) has initiated offshore seaweed cultivation primarily in the Gujarat region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% of India's GDP, not seaweed cultivation specifically. While seaweed farming is a part of aquaculture, it's a small fraction of the overall contribution.  The question attempts to mislead by inflating the economic contribution of seaweed farming.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The target year for achieving 1 million tons of seaweed production under PMMSY is 2025, not 2030. This slight alteration in the year creates a plausible distractor for candidates who may remember the initiative but not the precise timeline.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions that offshore cultivation in the Andaman region was started by NIOT-ACOSTI. The question attempts to create confusion by replacing the Andaman region with the Gujarat region. This is a geographically inaccurate statement, designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the location of NIOT's initiatives.


**2. With reference to the Central Silk Board, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is currently the world's largest producer of silk, accounting for over 50% of global production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that India is the *second* largest silk producer globally, with 42% of global production (2023 data).  The question uses a misleading statement by exaggerating India's position in the global silk market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Karnataka contributed around 32% of India's total silk production in 2023, exceeding Andhra Pradesh's contribution.  The question reverses the contribution shares of these two major silk-producing states.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the recent celebration of the Central Silk Board's platinum jubilee. This statement serves as a straightforward factual recall test.



**3. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA), consider the following statements:**

1. NISA celebrated its 75th anniversary recently.
2. ICAR-NISA's primary focus is on promoting organic farming practices.
3. ICAR-NISA is primarily involved in research related to secondary crops, excluding major food grains.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that ICAR-NISA celebrated its 100th year of establishment, not its 75th anniversary.  This is a classic example of a distractor using a close but incorrect number.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ICAR-NISA likely contributes to research across various agricultural domains, the passage doesn't specify a primary focus on organic farming. The question tries to lead the candidate towards a common assumption about ICAR's activities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage does not explicitly limit NISA's research to only secondary crops. The question creates a misleading impression by implying a specific area of focus that might not be entirely accurate.  ICAR's research is broad and encompasses many aspects of agriculture.



**4. With reference to Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMSY primarily focuses on enhancing inland fisheries infrastructure, neglecting marine fisheries.
2. The establishment of Integrated Aquaparks is not a component of PMMSY.
3. PMMSY includes initiatives to promote ornamental fish farming through the Rangeen Machhli app.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMSY is an umbrella scheme aiming to address gaps in both marine and inland fisheries production and infrastructure.  The question presents a false dichotomy to test the candidate's understanding of the scheme's broad scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly mentions that Integrated Aquaparks were introduced under PMMSY. The question uses a direct negation of a factual element from the text.

Statement 3 is correct. The Rangeen Machhli app, mentioned in the text, is part of PMMSY's efforts to promote ornamental fish farming. This serves as a direct fact-recall question.



**5. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports in 2023-24 exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion set in 2018.
2.  Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, exceeding marine products.
3.  India's share of world agricultural exports in 2022 was greater than its share of world agricultural imports.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target.  This statement directly contradicts information in the source.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice constitutes a significant portion (21%) of total exports, marine products also hold a substantial share (15%), making rice not the largest export.  This statement plays on the relative percentages to create confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage indicates that India's share of agricultural exports (2.4%) in 2022 was higher than its share of agricultural imports (1.9%).  This is a direct factual recall question.


**6. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) sets the MSP for all agricultural commodities, including those not included in the list of 22 crops.
2.  The MSP for jute and copra is determined independently, not based on other crops' MSPs.
3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the primary procuring agency for all 22 crops covered under the MSP scheme.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CACP recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.  The question misrepresents the decision-making process related to MSP.  Also, the CACP doesn't set MSP for all agricultural commodities, only the 22 mentioned.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that MSPs for Toria and de-husked coconut are *based* on the MSPs of rapeseed & mustard and copra, respectively.  The question negates this direct relationship.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While FCI is the nodal agency for wheat and paddy, it is not the sole procuring agency for all 22 crops under the MSP scheme. The question makes an overgeneralization about FCI's role.



**7.  With reference to India's deep-sea mining, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules explicitly exclude mineral oils and hydrocarbons.  The question misrepresents the scope of the regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions various mineral deposits, including polymetallic nodules, seafloor massive sulphides, and cobalt-rich crusts, indicating exploration is not limited to a single type of resource.  The question creates a false limitation.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage mentions that India's offshore mineral reserves include rare earth elements, and the Geological Survey of India has delineated resources in offshore areas.  This is a direct factual recall question.


**8. With reference to India's steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's per capita steel consumption exceeds the global average.
2. The majority of India's coking coal is domestically produced.
3. India's steel exports to the European Union are unaffected by carbon taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's per capita finished steel consumption (97.7 kg) is significantly lower than the world average (219.3 kg).  The question uses a false comparative statistic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India largely relies on costly imports of coking coal from Australia to meet its demand.  The question presents the opposite of the factual situation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that India's steel exports to the EU face threats due to the imposition of carbon taxes.  The question negates a clearly stated fact.

3. The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) is solely between India and Russia.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a two-phase project.  The question alters a key detail about the project's implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DFCs are managed by Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL), a special purpose vehicle under Indian Railways.  The question assigns responsibility to the wrong government ministry.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While India and Russia have agreed to RELOS, the passage mentions that India also has similar agreements with other countries (US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea).  The question presents a false limitation on the scope of RELOS.


**10. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Vadhvan Port, once operational, will be India's second-largest container port.
2. Mormugao Port is the first port in India to introduce Green Ship Incentives through the ESI.
3. Dry ports primarily serve to reduce congestion in inland waterways.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that Vadhvan Port will be the *largest* container port in India, not the second largest. The question slightly alters a key piece of information.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Mormugao Port is the first in India to introduce Green Ship Incentives. This is a direct fact recall question.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Dry ports are inland terminals that connect to seaports by rail or road, reducing pressure on coastal ports and improving access to international trade for landlocked regions, not inland waterways.  The question misrepresents the function of dry ports.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Agreement on Agriculture under the WTO:**

1. Tariffication, a key aspect of Market Access under the Agreement, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.  This includes abolishing quotas and variable levies.
2. The Agreement's Domestic Support provisions categorize subsidies based on their impact on production and trade, utilizing various "boxes" to differentiate their effects.  The Green Box allows for subsidies that are considered less trade-distorting.
3. The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 mandated the elimination of export subsidies by both developed and developing countries, aiming to create a more level playing field in agricultural trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect provisions within the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture.  Statement 1 correctly defines tariffication as a crucial element of market access, requiring the replacement of non-tariff barriers with equivalent tariffs.  Statement 2 accurately describes the categorization of domestic support measures into different boxes based on their trade-distorting effects, a key mechanism for managing domestic subsidies. The Green Box, for instance, allows for certain subsidies deemed less trade-distorting.  Finally, Statement 3 correctly identifies the Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 as a significant step towards fairer agricultural trade by mandating the elimination of export subsidies for both developed and developing nations.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. With reference to the OECD Global Minimum Tax, consider the following statements:**

1.  The OECD Global Minimum Tax aims to prevent tax avoidance by multinational corporations (MNCs) by establishing a minimum effective tax rate of 10% on their global profits.
2.  The Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules underpin the OECD Global Minimum Tax, providing a framework for implementing the minimum tax rate across different jurisdictions.
3.  The OECD Global Minimum Tax is a unilateral initiative, implemented independently by each participating country, without a binding international agreement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the minimum effective tax rate is 15%, not 10%.  Statement 2 is correct; the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules are the foundation for the OECD Global Minimum Tax, providing a framework for its implementation.  Statement 3 is incorrect because while individual countries implement the rules, the initiative is a multilateral effort coordinated by the OECD and G20, representing a collaborative, international approach rather than a unilateral one.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the UN Global Tax Treaty:**

1. The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to create a more equitable international tax system by focusing primarily on taxing the profits of multinational corporations operating in developing countries.
2.  Developing nations, including India, largely supported the terms of reference for the UN Global Tax Treaty, while many industrialized nations opposed it.
3. The UN Global Tax Treaty seeks to establish a legally binding global minimum corporate tax rate, similar to the OECD's initiative, but with broader participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially inaccurate. While the treaty aims for a more equitable system, its scope is broader than solely focusing on MNC profits in developing countries. It aims for a fair and effective international tax system for all. Statement 2 is correct; the text clearly indicates the differing stances of developing and industrialized nations. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the UN treaty aims for a more effective system, it doesn't specifically mention a legally binding global minimum corporate tax rate like the OECD's initiative.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects information from the provided text.


**4. With reference to the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) and Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), consider the following statements:**

1. MAP is a mechanism used to resolve transfer pricing disputes that have already arisen, while APAs are used to prevent such disputes from arising in the future.
2.  Both MAP and APAs are primarily implemented through unilateral action by individual countries, without any international coordination.
3.  Taxpayers utilize MAP for existing transfer pricing disputes, while they opt for APAs to establish transfer pricing methodologies for future transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the core functions of MAP and APAs in resolving and preventing transfer pricing disputes. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Both MAP and APAs are facilitated through bilateral tax treaties (DTAAs) which require international coordination and agreement between the countries involved. Statement 3 correctly explains the usage of MAP for resolving existing disputes and APAs for establishing future pricing methodologies.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding India's offshore mineral resources:**

1.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable reserves of gold, diamonds, and rare earth elements, among other minerals.
2. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons, extracted from India's EEZ.
3.  The rules mandate the use of the United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC) and Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) for exploration stages and feasibility studies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the provided text mentions the presence of various minerals including gold, diamonds, and rare earth elements within India's EEZ. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The rules specifically exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals listed in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. Statement 3 is correct; the rules explicitly require adherence to modified versions of UNFC and CRIRSCO standards for exploration and feasibility studies.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

1. The Geneva Package aims to eliminate all subsidies related to fishing activities, regardless of their environmental impact, to ensure sustainable fish stocks.
2. The agreement was adopted during the 11th Ministerial Conference of the WTO, held in 2021.
3.  The primary objective of the Geneva Package is to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to the depletion of the world's fish stocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Package focuses on curbing *harmful* subsidies, not eliminating all subsidies.  The goal is to ensure sustainable fishing practices, not necessarily eliminate all subsidies. Statement 2 is incorrect; the agreement was adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in 2022, not the 11th in 2021. Statement 3 correctly identifies the primary objective of the Geneva Package as curbing harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of fish stocks. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**7.  Consider the following statements about Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security:**

1.  The "peace clause" agreed upon at the WTO's 9th Ministerial Conference provides a permanent solution to the concerns surrounding PSH and its potential trade-distorting effects.
2.  Developing countries generally advocate for increased de minimis limits and amendments to the formula used for calculating food subsidy caps, seeking to legitimize higher subsidies for food stockholding programs.
3.  Most developed countries argue that PSH is market-distorting and that there should be no export restrictions related to food stockholding programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "peace clause" was an *interim* solution, not a permanent one.  It provided temporary protection against WTO challenges regarding PSH but did not resolve the underlying issue. Statement 2 accurately reflects the position of many developing countries in advocating for higher subsidy limits and adjustments to the calculation methods. Statement 3 accurately represents the concerns of most developed countries regarding PSH's potential market-distorting effects. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**8. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion by 2022, set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.
2.  Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices.
3.  Vegetable oil is the largest import item in India's agricultural trade, followed by pulses and fruits and vegetables.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that agricultural exports fell short of the $60 billion target. Statement 2 is correct; the text indicates that rice is the largest export, followed by marine products and spices. Statement 3 is also correct; the text specifies that vegetable oil is the largest import, followed by pulses and fruits and vegetables.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements about schemes and initiatives related to the Indian fisheries sector:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) primarily focuses on enhancing post-harvest infrastructure while neglecting other aspects of the value chain.
2.  Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) and Biofloc technology are promoted under PMMSY to improve efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture.
3. The Rangeen Machhli app provides information on popular ornamental fish species in all 22 official languages of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMSY is a comprehensive scheme addressing various aspects of the fisheries value chain, including production, technology, post-harvest infrastructure, and value chain strengthening. Statement 2 is correct; RAS and Biofloc are indeed promoted under PMMSY for improved aquaculture practices. Statement 3 is incorrect. The app provides information in eight Indian languages, not all 22 official languages. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) determines the MSP for all agricultural commodities, including those not covered under the government's procurement program.
2.  The MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure accurate reflection of market prices.
3.  The CACP considers only the A2 + FL cost of production when recommending MSPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CACP recommends MSPs, it doesn't cover all agricultural commodities; only 22 crops are included. Statement 2 is incorrect. MSP is announced at the *beginning* of the sowing season, not at the end of the harvesting season. Statement 3 is incorrect. The CACP considers three types of production costs (A2, A2+FL, and C2), not just A2+FL.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.



**1. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port (formerly Kolkata Port) is India's only major riverine port.
2.  The Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) in Tamil Nadu is the only corporatized port registered as a company.
3.  Vadhvan Port, upon completion, will be the 14th major port in India, surpassing Mumbai Port as the largest container port.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port, formerly known as Kolkata Port, is indeed India's only major riverine port, distinguishing it from other major ports situated along the coastline.  Its location on the Hooghly River necessitates unique operational strategies and infrastructure.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kamarajar Port (Ennore Port) holds the unique distinction of being the only corporatized major port in India registered as a company. This corporate structure allows for greater operational flexibility and efficiency compared to the traditional port authority model.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Vadhvan Port is planned to be a significant container port and is being developed as the 13th major port (not 14th), it is not projected to surpass Mumbai Port as the largest. Mumbai Port’s established infrastructure and strategic location give it a considerable advantage.  The statement misrepresents the projected scale of Vadhvan Port in relation to existing major ports.



**2. With reference to the Harit Shrey scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harit Shrey scheme, launched in 2023, incentivizes ships with favorable Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores to promote decarbonization.
2.  Mormugao Port Authority, in Goa, was the first Indian port to introduce the Harit Shrey scheme, making it a global leader in green shipping incentives.
3.  The ESI platform, published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), identifies ships that exceed minimum emission standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Harit Shrey scheme is designed to incentivize environmentally friendly shipping practices by rewarding vessels with high ESI scores. This directly contributes to the decarbonization efforts within the maritime sector.

Statement 2 is also correct. Mormugao Port Authority in Goa was indeed a pioneer in India by being the first port to introduce the Harit Shrey scheme.  This initiative showcases India's commitment to sustainable port operations and positions Mormugao as a leader in green shipping.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The ESI platform is actually published by the International Association of Ports and Harbours (IAPH), not the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The IMO sets international maritime regulations, but the ESI is an independent assessment tool used by ports to evaluate and incentivize environmentally conscious shipping.



**3. With reference to the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agreement aims to curb harmful fishing subsidies that deplete global fish stocks, with a special and differential treatment (S&DT) provision for developing countries.
2.  The Agreement requires acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members to come into effect, and as of December 2024, it lacks the necessary support from several major fishing nations, including India.
3.  India's opposition to the Agreement stems from its demand for a moratorium on distant-water fishing by developed nations and a greater emphasis on the "polluter pays principle."


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies is designed to address the issue of overfishing caused by harmful subsidies.  The S&DT provision acknowledges the differing capacities of developing and developed nations in implementing the agreement.

Statement 2 is correct. The agreement requires a two-thirds majority for ratification, and as of December 2024, it hadn't reached that threshold, highlighting the significant political challenges in achieving global consensus on fisheries management.  India's non-participation is a crucial factor in this shortfall.

Statement 3 is also correct.  India's concerns regarding the agreement are rooted in its belief that developed nations, historically responsible for significant overfishing, should bear a greater responsibility for rectifying the situation.  The "polluter pays principle" and demands for a moratorium on distant-water fishing reflect this position.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the WTO's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies and India's stance on it.



**4. With reference to the UN Global Tax Treaty, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to create a fair, stable, and inclusive international tax system, addressing concerns about tax avoidance by multinational corporations (MNCs).
2. Developing countries, including India, largely supported the treaty's terms of reference, while several industrialized nations opposed it, reflecting a North-South divide on international tax cooperation.
3. The OECD Global Minimum Tax, a parallel initiative, mandates a minimum 15% tax rate on corporate profits, aiming to reduce profit shifting incentives, and is fully supported by India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The overarching goal of the UN Global Tax Treaty is to establish a more equitable and effective international tax system.  This addresses the long-standing concern of tax avoidance by multinational corporations, which often shifts profits to low-tax jurisdictions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The UN's effort to create a global tax treaty has revealed a significant divergence in viewpoints between developing and developed nations. Developing countries generally favor the treaty as a means to increase their tax revenue, while several developed nations have voiced opposition, indicating a significant geopolitical challenge.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the OECD Global Minimum Tax is a related initiative aiming to curb tax avoidance, it is not fully supported by India.  India's position on the OECD initiative is more nuanced and reflects concerns about its potential impact on developing economies.  The statement oversimplifies the complexities of India's stance on global tax reform.


**5. With reference to India's seaweed farming initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed farming, a component of aquaculture, contributes significantly to India's GDP, exceeding 5% in 2023.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025.

2.  Dry ports, also known as inland ports, provide cost-effective gateways to international trade for landlocked regions, reducing pressure on coastal ports.
3.  Dry ports primarily consist of Inland Container Depots (ICDs) and exclude Container Freight Stations (CFSs) and Air Freight Stations (AFSs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that Bihar's first dry port is indeed located in Bihta near Patna.  While it primarily serves as an ICD, it is inaccurate to state that it is *primarily* rail-based, as road connectivity is also a crucial aspect of inland port functionality.

Statement 2 is correct. Dry ports significantly reduce transportation costs and time for landlocked states, facilitating international trade and easing congestion at coastal ports.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Dry ports encompass a wider range of facilities than just ICDs.  CFSs and AFSs are integral components of the dry port infrastructure, facilitating efficient handling and movement of goods.  The statement incorrectly limits the components of a dry port.

(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CPPI 2023, jointly published by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence, indeed recognized nine Indian ports among the top 100 globally. This reflects the progress made by India's port sector in enhancing efficiency and capacity.

Statement 2 is also correct. Yangshan Port in China did achieve the top ranking in the CPPI 2023, underscoring its high level of operational efficiency and global standing as a leading container port.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The CPPI considers various factors beyond infrastructure, including operational efficiency and technological advancements.  A holistic assessment of port performance is crucial for the CPPI ranking, making the statement inaccurate.


**9. With reference to Land Ports and Integrated Check Posts (ICPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Land Ports are designated areas on international borders that facilitate the clearance of passengers and goods, managed by the Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI).
2. ICPs are single complexes housing all regulatory agencies involved in trade and commerce, streamlining customs and immigration procedures, but do not address security concerns.
3.  The LPAI is responsible for establishing, operating, and managing ICPs, ensuring efficient cross-border trade and movement of people.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Land Ports, designated areas on international borders, play a crucial role in facilitating the smooth flow of passengers and goods.  The LPAI is the responsible authority for managing these crucial border points.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ICPs are designed to address both trade facilitation and security concerns under one roof.  The integration of various regulatory agencies is intended to enhance efficiency while simultaneously maintaining security protocols.

Statement 3 is correct. The LPAI holds the responsibility for the planning, construction, and operation of ICPs, which are vital for ensuring efficient cross-border trade and movement of people.  The statement accurately depicts the LPAI's role in this critical area.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement, a significant outcome of the Uruguay Round of GATT, established minimum standards for IPR protection among WTO members.  The provided date for its entry into force is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement grants exclusive rights to creators for a *certain period*, not indefinitely.  The duration of IPR protection varies depending on the type of intellectual property and the specific national laws. The statement incorrectly asserts perpetual protection.

Statement 3 is correct.  The TRIPS Agreement is widely recognized as the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on IPR, providing a vital framework for international trade in intellectual property.  It is a cornerstone of the WTO's regulatory system.



**1. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. PMGS NMP utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by the National Institute of Space Applications and Geoinformatics (NISAG) employing a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform.
2. The PM GatiShakti approach is driven by eight engines encompassing Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, Logistics Infrastructure, and Energy Infrastructure.

The use of GIS and the integration with ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps are accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti approach is driven by seven engines, not eight.  Energy infrastructure is not explicitly listed as one of the seven core engines.

Statement 3 is correct. PMGS NMP does integrate data from various ministries, including projects under Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN.  It is also hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud platform.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The inclusion of the incorrect detail in statement 1 and the outright inaccuracy in statement 2 makes option (b) the only viable choice.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate ₹6 lakh crore over five years (FY22-FY26) by monetizing government assets.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state-level PPP projects.
3. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides up to 50% of project costs as a capital grant to improve project viability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the timeframe. The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22-FY25), not five.  The overall goal and method of monetizing existing government assets are accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee primarily evaluates central sector PPP projects; its purview does not automatically extend to state-level projects.

Statement 3 is incorrect regarding the percentage of funding. The VGF provides up to 40% of project costs, not 50%, as a capital grant to enhance project viability.

Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate as presented. However, statement 1 is closer to the truth than the other two, making (a) the best option, albeit with a factual inaccuracy.


**3. With reference to Asset Monetization (AM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended AM in 2010, which was subsequently implemented through the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) in the Union Budget 2021-22.
2.  Asset Monetization involves only the sale of government-owned assets to private entities.
3. The top five sectors identified in the NMP for asset monetization account for approximately 75% of the aggregate pipeline.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended AM in 2012, not 2010. While the NMP was announced in the Union Budget 2021-22, the timeline is slightly off.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Asset Monetization involves licensing or leasing of assets, not just outright sales.  This allows for revenue generation while retaining some level of government control.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The top five sectors in the NMP account for approximately 83% of the aggregate pipeline, not 75%.

Therefore, all three statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.

3. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP covers 22 crops, not 24, including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The final decision on MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the nodal agency for *all* MSP-covered crops.  Other agencies also participate in procurement.

Therefore, all three statements are factually inaccurate, making (d) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the Digital Agriculture Mission (DAM), consider the following statements:**

1. DAM's Agri Stack includes a Farmers' Registry issuing unique Farmer IDs, but excludes geotagged village maps and crop-sown registries.
2. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS for real-time information on crop conditions.
3.  DAM aims to create digital identities for 10 crore farmers over five years and launch a nationwide Digital Crop Survey within three years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Agri Stack under DAM *does* include geotagged village maps and crop-sown registries as key components, along with the Farmer IDs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Krishi DSS effectively utilizes data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS to provide real-time agricultural information.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  DAM aims to create digital identities for 11 crore farmers over three years, and launch a nationwide Digital Crop Survey within two years, not the timelines mentioned in the statement.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The significant deviations in statements 1 and 3 from the factual data make this a challenging question.


**1. With reference to India's logistics infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases, with a significant portion dedicated to freight corridors.
2.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project, overseen by DFCCIL, aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% in 2019 to 45% in 2030, primarily supporting the National Rail Plan 2030.
3.  The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) and PM GatiShakti are primarily focused on improving passenger transport efficiency rather than freight transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the exact breakdown isn't specified publicly as a proportion of the total 65,000 km, a significant portion is strategically planned to enhance freight movement.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project is a key initiative to improve the efficiency of freight transportation by rail. DFCCIL's role is central to this, and the target of increasing rail freight's share in national transportation is clearly stated in relation to the National Rail Plan 2030.

Statement 3 is incorrect. LEEP and PM GatiShakti are indeed aimed at improving logistics efficiency, but this encompasses both passenger and freight transport.  To state they are *primarily* focused on passenger transport is a misrepresentation of their scope.  Both programs aim to integrate various modes of transport, including freight, to enhance overall efficiency.  The statement incorrectly narrows their focus.


**2. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  RELOS, recently approved by Russia, allows the Indian and Russian militaries to access each other's airbases and ports for logistical support only during wartime.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  RELOS facilitates access to logistics and support facilities during *both* wartime and peacetime missions, not just wartime.  The agreement aims to enhance interoperability and mutual support in a broader range of scenarios.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RELOS explicitly covers the replenishment of essential supplies for troops, warships, and aircraft while operating *away* from home bases and ports, not just within national territories. The entire purpose is to enable support during deployments outside of their home countries.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that India has similar agreements in place with the US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea.  This is a factual statement supported by the provided text.


**3. With reference to India's port sector development, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Vadhvan Port will be the *13th* major port in India, not the 12th.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While it is projected to be one of India's largest deep-water ports, the text states it will be the *country's largest container port*, not the second largest.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage does not provide information about the funding source for Vadhvan Port.  While private sector involvement may be part of the project, the passage does not rule out government support or financing. The statement therefore makes an unsupported claim.


**4. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EIF is a bilateral partnership exclusively focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to utilize trade for sustainable development.
2.  The EIF involves 51 partner countries and receives support from various international organizations such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization.
3.  The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) acts as the EIF Trust Fund Manager, overseeing the allocation and disbursement of funds.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the EIF is described as a *multilateral* partnership, not a bilateral one.  The involvement of multiple actors distinguishes it from a bilateral framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the EIF has 51 partner countries and receives support from international organizations, including the World Bank and WTO.

Statement 3 is correct.  UNOPS's role as the EIF Trust Fund Manager is explicitly mentioned in the provided text.


**5. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1.  DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) which was created under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
2.  DBN's primary purpose is to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas at subsidized prices through a non-lapsable pool of funds generated by a Universal Access Levy of 10% on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of licensees.
3.  The funds for DBN are solely derived from the license fees charged to telecom operators, with no other sources of funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that DBN replaces USOF and that the latter was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While DBN does fund telecom schemes in underserved areas, the Universal Access Levy was 5% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR), not 10%.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage doesn't specify whether other sources of funding exist for DBN beyond the license fees.  The statement therefore makes an unsupported claim about the exclusivity of funding sources.


**6. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The AVGC-XR NCoE will be established as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2012.

1. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND) registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, will apply to all UCBs irrespective of their tier classification.
3.  UCBs are permitted to open new branches up to a maximum of 10 branches without prior RBI approval, regardless of their existing branch network size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, meaning it accepts public funds and interacts directly with customers.  Type I NBFCs do not have a customer interface.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the regulatory oversight and risk profile of the organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework will exclude UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). This is a significant detail highlighting the nuanced approach the RBI takes towards managing risk within the UCB sector.  The application is not universal across all UCBs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ease of expansion for UCBs allows them to open new branches up to 10% (maximum 5 branches) of their existing branch network in the previous financial year. This is a restriction, not an unlimited allowance, showcasing the RBI's measured approach to managing growth within the cooperative banking system. The statement misrepresents the limitation imposed.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICI includes only eight core industries and their combined weight in the IIP is 40.27%, not over 45%.  This highlights the importance of understanding the precise composition and weight of the ICI for accurate economic analysis.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Petroleum Refinery Products have the highest weight (28.04%) in the ICI, not the lowest. This shows the significant contribution of this sector to the overall industrial production index and underlines the importance of accurately assessing the weights assigned to different sectors.

Statement 3 is correct. The Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry is indeed responsible for releasing the ICI data. This factual accuracy is crucial for understanding the source and reliability of this key economic indicator.

2.  India's amendments to the Patents Act, 1970, were made in response to the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement.
3. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

1.  Private investment, as a percentage of GDP, consistently remained above 25% from the 1980s until 2011-12.
2. The GFCF (investment) reached its lowest point as a percentage of GDP in 2015-16.
3. From independence to economic liberalization, investment in India remained consistently below 10% of GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF rose significantly, it did not consistently remain above 25% from the 1980s until 2011-12.  The statement oversimplifies a complex trend and ignores the fluctuations in investment levels during this period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The lowest point for private investment as a percentage of GDP was in 2020-21, not 2015-16.  This demonstrates the need for precise recall of economic data points for accurate analysis.

Statement 3 is correct.  Before economic liberalization, investment remained close to or slightly above/below 10% of GDP. This statement accurately reflects the historical trend in investment levels and provides context for understanding subsequent changes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian technical textiles market is the fifth largest globally, not the third.  This highlights the importance of accurate data in evaluating the current standing of Indian industries within the global context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PLI scheme is a significant initiative directly supporting the growth of the technical textiles sector, aligning with the objectives of the National Technical Textiles Mission.  The statement incorrectly suggests a lack of connection between the two.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Technical Textiles Mission explicitly aims to make India a global leader in this sector. This accurately reflects the mission's core objective and its strategic importance for the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulations do indeed mandate the disclosure of this information, promoting transparency and accountability within the credit rating industry. This is a key aspect of regulatory oversight.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI, IRDA, and PFRDA *do* regulate certain aspects of CRAs' operations within their respective jurisdictions. This highlights the multi-layered regulatory framework governing CRAs in India.


**9. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are exclusively designed for investment in government-owned infrastructure projects.
2.  InvITs are not recognized as borrowers under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs can invest in various infrastructure projects, including those privately owned, not limited to government-owned assets. This broader scope is a key characteristic of InvITs as an investment vehicle.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act. This is important for understanding the legal and financial implications of InvIT investments and their ability to access debt financing.

Statement 3 is correct. The statement accurately identifies the key parties involved in the structure and operation of an InvIT.  This is crucial for understanding the governance and management of these investment vehicles.


**10. With reference to the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IFSC Authority is a *statutory* body, not just an autonomous one. This reflects its legal basis and authority.

Statement 2 is correct. The IFSC Authority’s regulatory reach is specifically confined to the IFSCs, making it a specialized regulator within the Indian financial landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IFSC Authority's regulatory powers extend beyond banking, encompassing a broader range of financial activities within IFSCs.  This is essential for the holistic regulation of the IFSC ecosystem.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is followed by the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Project Nexus:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating instant cross-border payments.
2. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS) that could be integrated into Project Nexus.
3.  Project Nexus is primarily focused on enabling faster and cheaper cross-border payments for businesses, excluding retail transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative involving several countries, not just India and Singapore.  It aims to interlink the domestic instant payment systems of multiple nations to enable seamless cross-border transactions.  Statement 2 is correct. UPI, being an example of a robust and efficient IPS, is a prime candidate for integration within the Project Nexus framework. Its inclusion would significantly improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments. Statement 3 is incorrect. Project Nexus explicitly aims to facilitate instant cross-border retail payments, thereby making it accessible to both businesses and individual consumers.  The goal is to make cross-border payments cheaper, faster, more transparent, and accessible to all.  The focus is not limited to business transactions.


**2. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments primarily aim to restrict investments from foreign venture capital investors (FVCIs) in Indian startups.
2.  A Foreign Venture Capital Investor (FVCI) is defined as an investor incorporated in India and registered under SEBI regulations.
3. The regulations govern investments made by FVCIs in both listed and unlisted Indian companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, are not intended to restrict investments from FVCIs. Instead, they aim to update and streamline the regulatory framework for FVCIs operating in India, potentially facilitating greater foreign investment in Indian ventures. Statement 2 is incorrect. An FVCI is explicitly defined as an investor *incorporated outside* India, not within India.  This is a crucial distinction, as the regulations specifically target foreign investment. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  FVCIs primarily make investments in venture capital undertakings in India, which are typically *unlisted* companies.  Investments in listed companies are not the primary focus of these regulations, although the definition of "venture capital undertaking" may have some flexibility.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is a non-banking financial company (NBFC) registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and functions as a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  NUCFDC's primary objective is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs, but it does not offer any regulatory compliance assistance.
3. The establishment of an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first proposed by a committee chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NUCFDC is indeed registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND and acts as an SRO for UCBs, providing regulatory oversight and support. Statement 2 is incorrect. NUCFDC's role extends beyond just liquidity and capital support. It also actively assists UCBs in meeting regulatory compliance requirements under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and facilitates communication with regulators. This is a key aspect of its function as an umbrella organization. Statement 3 is correct. The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was initially highlighted by the RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan. Although a model was later refined by another working group, the initial impetus originated with Viswanathan's committee.


**4. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework will be implemented from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The framework applies to all UCBs regardless of their tier categorization or whether they are under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the key parameters for monitoring UCBs under the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date of the new PCA framework is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  This is a crucial detail reflecting the timeline for transition. Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework specifically excludes UCBs that are already under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  This shows a targeted approach, focusing on banks that are not already under intensive regulatory measures. Statement 3 is correct. The PCA framework explicitly uses Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability (CAP) as key monitoring parameters for assessing the financial health of UCBs.  These are standard metrics used in banking supervision globally.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the eligibility criteria for Small Finance Banks (SFBs) to transition into Universal Banks:**

1. SFBs must maintain a minimum net worth of Rs. 500 crore to be eligible for transition.
2.  A satisfactory track record of performance for a minimum of three years is required for SFBs seeking to become Universal Banks.
3.  SFBs must have consistently maintained a Gross Non-Performing Asset (GNPA) ratio of less than 2% and a Net NPA ratio of less than 0.5% over the last two financial years to qualify.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The minimum net worth requirement for SFBs transitioning to Universal Banks is significantly higher, set at Rs. 1000 crore, not Rs. 500 crore. This reflects the higher capital requirements associated with the broader range of activities undertaken by Universal Banks. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The required track record of satisfactory performance is for a minimum of five years, not three. This longer timeframe ensures a thorough assessment of the SFB's stability and operational efficiency before allowing a transition to a more complex banking model. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The stipulated limits for GNPA and NNPA are 3% and 1%, respectively, not 2% and 0.5%.  These thresholds are carefully chosen to ensure the financial soundness of the transitioning SFBs.


**6. With reference to NaBFID (National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  NaBFID's primary objective is to support short-term infrastructure financing in India.
3. NaBFID is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a private sector bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  This is because NaBFID's activities are related to banking and financial services, falling under the RBI's regulatory purview. Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's focus is on *long-term*, non-recourse infrastructure financing, not short-term financing.  This long-term perspective is crucial for supporting large-scale infrastructure projects. Statement 3 is incorrect. NaBFID is entirely owned by the Government of India, not a private sector bank. This reflects the government's role in supporting infrastructure development through dedicated financial institutions.


**7. With reference to India's e-commerce market, consider the following statements:**

1. Invest India projects the e-commerce market to reach $250 billion by 2030.
2.  In 2022, the e-commerce sector constituted approximately 5% of India's total retail market.
3. 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted under the automatic route for inventory-based e-commerce models in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Invest India's projection for the e-commerce market size by 2030 is $325 billion, not $250 billion.  This highlights the substantial growth potential of the sector. Statement 2 is incorrect. In 2022, the e-commerce sector's contribution to India's total retail market was approximately 7%, not 5%. This signifies the increasing importance of e-commerce in the overall retail landscape. Statement 3 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted under the automatic route for inventory-based e-commerce models in India. This is a protective measure aimed at safeguarding the interests of domestic retailers.  FDI is permitted in the marketplace model.


**8.  With reference to India Stack, consider the following statements:**

1. India Stack is a proprietary digital public infrastructure (DPI) developed by a private technology company.
2. The India Stack's identity layer primarily relies on the Aadhaar system.
3. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was launched by the G20 India Presidency in 2022 to promote the adoption of DPI globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India Stack is an *open-source* digital public infrastructure (DPI), not a proprietary system developed by a private entity.  Its open nature facilitates wider adoption and interoperability. Statement 2 is correct. Aadhaar plays a central role in India Stack's identity layer, providing a robust and scalable identity verification system.  This is a key component of the overall DPI architecture. Statement 3 is incorrect. The GDPIR was announced at the G20 virtual leaders' summit in 2023, not 2022.  The launch of the GDPIR underscores India's commitment to fostering the global adoption of DPI.


**9. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. UPI was launched in 2017 and is operated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is an umbrella organization for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India, and it developed UPI.
3.  UPI is currently used only within India and has not been adopted internationally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UPI was launched in 2016, not 2017.  This is a key detail related to the timeline of its introduction.  The RBI is involved in its oversight but does not operate UPI directly. Statement 2 is correct. NPCI is responsible for the development and operation of UPI, and it functions as an umbrella organization for retail payment systems within India.  This reflects its role in the nation's payments infrastructure. Statement 3 is incorrect. UPI is expanding internationally and has been adopted or is being piloted in several countries, demonstrating its potential for global reach.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS):**

1. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing under specific circumstances, benefiting developed countries more than developing nations.
2.  The TRIPS Agreement explicitly prohibits member states from taking measures to protect public health, even in emergencies.
3.  India joined the TRIPS Agreement in 1994 and amended its Patents Act accordingly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the TRIPS Agreement does allow for compulsory licensing, it's designed to benefit *developing* countries by allowing them to produce patented products or processes without the patent owner's consent under certain circumstances, particularly for public health reasons.  This is a crucial flexibility built into the agreement. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement specifically affirms that the TRIPS Agreement does *not* prevent members from taking measures to protect public health. This is a key clarification addressing concerns about the agreement's impact on public health. Statement 3 is incorrect. India joined the TRIPS Agreement in 1995, not 1994, and subsequently amended its Patents Act in compliance with the agreement (e.g., the Patents (Amendment) Act of 2005).  This reflects India's commitment to international intellectual property standards.


**11.  With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF remained consistently above 20% of GDP in India from independence until economic liberalization.
2.  Private investment, as a component of GFCF, reached its lowest point in 2019-20.
3.  GFCF is also known as investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  GFCF fluctuated around 10% of GDP from independence until economic liberalization; it was not consistently above 20%. This reflects the lower investment levels during that period. Statement 2 is incorrect. Private investment, a component of GFCF, hit its lowest point at 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21, not 2019-20.  This is a significant detail in understanding the recent trends in investment. Statement 3 is correct. GFCF is indeed another term used to refer to investment, representing the total investment in fixed capital assets within an economy.


**12. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) Bank, established in 1976, is India's first Microfinance Institution (MFI).
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans only to individuals belonging to low-income households.
3. Microfinance institutions typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SEWA Bank was established in 1974, not 1976, making it India's first MFI. This is a crucial detail regarding the history of microfinance in India. Statement 2 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, not exclusively to individuals from low-income households.  This broadens the scope of its beneficiaries. Statement 3 is incorrect. Microfinance institutions generally charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks due to the higher risk associated with lending to marginalized populations.  This is an important factor in assessing the cost of microfinance.


**13. With reference to India's transition from LIBOR, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI issued an advisory regarding the transition from LIBOR in 2022.
2.  The Mumbai Modified Interbank Forward Overnight Rate (MIFOR) is an alternative reference rate (ARR) established by the Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL).
3.  FBIL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI did issue an advisory to banks and other regulated entities in 2022 to facilitate a smooth transition away from LIBOR. This highlights the proactive approach taken by the RBI to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR cessation. Statement 2 is correct.  MIFOR is indeed an ARR developed as an alternative to LIBOR, and FBIL plays a key role in its administration.  This reflects the importance of developing domestic benchmark interest rates. Statement 3 is incorrect. FBIL is jointly owned by FIMMDA, FEDA, and IBA, not a wholly-owned subsidiary of the RBI.  This shows its collaborative nature and independence.


**14.  With reference to India's Participation in the Global Innovation Index (GII), consider the following statements:**

1. India's rank in the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2023 is 42 out of 55 economies.
2.  The Global Innovation Index and the Innovation Performance Index are identical rankings.
3.  India's rank in the Innovation Performance Index (IPI) remained unchanged in the latest assessment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that India's rank in the Innovation Performance Index (IPI) is 42 out of 55 economies.  There is no mention of India's GII rank in the given text. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Global Innovation Index (GII) and the Innovation Performance Index (IPI) are *distinct* rankings, using different methodologies and criteria.  This highlights the different aspects of innovation that each index seeks to measure. Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that India's position in the IPI remained unchanged.  This underscores the need for further analysis to understand the factors influencing India's innovation performance.


**15. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty was adopted by less than 100 countries, including India.
2.  The treaty aims to enhance the efficacy, transparency, and quality of the patent system to prevent erroneous patents.
3.  The treaty is legally binding upon adoption by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty was adopted by consensus among *more* than 150 countries, including India.  This highlights the widespread support for addressing the interface between intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge. Statement 2 is correct.  One of the treaty's key aims is to improve the patent system's efficiency and prevent the granting of patents for inventions that are not novel. This is a significant step towards protecting innovation and traditional knowledge. Statement 3 is incorrect. The treaty will come into force three months after 15 parties have ratified it; it's not legally binding upon mere adoption by WIPO.  This shows the process required for the treaty to become legally enforceable.



**1. With reference to deep-sea mining, consider the following statements:**

1. Polymetallic nodules are potato-shaped lumps containing high concentrations of manganese and iron, exclusively found in the Atlantic Ocean.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While GFCF fluctuated, it did not consistently remain below 5% of GDP during the period mentioned. It was slightly above or below 10%. Statement 2 is incorrect. Private investment as a percentage of GDP experienced a decline after 2011-12 before showing a rise.  Statement 3 is correct. GFCF is indeed a key indicator of investment and economic activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MSP is not applicable to all agricultural crops; it covers a specific set of 22 crops. Statement 2 is incorrect. While CACP recommends MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (chaired by the Prime Minister), not the President of India. Statement 3 is correct. The primary objective of MSP is to protect farmers from distress selling and ensure they receive a minimum guaranteed price for their produce. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the MSP mechanism, its scope, and its objectives.  The inclusion of incorrect details regarding the number of crops covered and the final decision-making authority serves as a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge.


**1. With reference to the Indian insurance sector, consider the following statements:**

2.  The IRDAI aims to achieve "Insurance for All" by 2030, providing every citizen with comprehensive insurance coverage.
3.  Insurance density in India witnessed a substantial rise, reaching $91 in 2021-22 from $11.5 in 2001-02.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Insurance penetration, representing the ratio of insurance premiums to GDP, indeed rose from 2.71% to 4.2% during the specified period, indicating growth in the sector. Statement 3 is also accurate; insurance density (premium per capita) increased substantially.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The IRDAI's target year for "Insurance for All" is 2047, not 2030.  This represents a long-term vision for financial inclusion, aiming to extend insurance coverage to all segments of the Indian population.  The significant increase in both penetration and density reflects progress towards this goal, but the timeline is different from what is stated in statement 2.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2.


**2. With reference to the World Bank's Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The B-Ready Index replaced the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings in 2022 due to data irregularities.
2. The index currently assesses 50 economies, excluding India, and is in a three-year rollout phase (2024-2026).
3. The B-Ready Index focuses solely on regulatory reforms and does not consider the broader business environment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the B-Ready Index did replace the EoDB rankings, the discontinuation of EoDB occurred in 2021, not 2022.  Statement 2 is correct. The index currently covers 50 economies (excluding India) and is being rolled out over three years, from 2024 to 2026. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The B-Ready Index assesses the business and investment climate across multiple areas, including reform advocacy, policy guidance, and analysis and research, going beyond just regulatory reforms. It examines factors influencing the private sector's growth and development. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The other options are incorrect because they include false statements about the index's timeline and scope.


**3. With reference to global and Indian poverty indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report indicates that approximately 1.1 billion people (~18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021, uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and includes indicators beyond the original global MPI model.
3.  The global MPI and NMPI both primarily focus on monetary poverty, neglecting other dimensions of deprivation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the findings of the 2024 Global MPI report.  Statement 2 is also correct.  India's NMPI, implemented in 2021, does utilize NFHS data and incorporates additional indicators like maternal health and bank account access beyond the original ten indicators of the global MPI model. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Both the global MPI and the NMPI are *multidimensional* poverty measures. They go beyond simply considering monetary income and encompass various aspects of deprivation across education, health, and living standards. While monetary poverty is a component of overall poverty, these indices explicitly measure multiple dimensions of poverty to provide a more holistic picture. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**4. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) exclusively measures gender disparities in reproductive health.
2. India's rank in the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) improved significantly in 2022 compared to 2021.
3. The HDR, published annually by UNDP, primarily focuses on economic growth as the sole indicator of human development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII assesses gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity (labour market participation).  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While India's GII ranking improved, its IHDI ranking *declined* in 2022.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The HDR uses the Human Development Index (HDI) as its core measure, which incorporates health, education, and standard of living, not just economic growth. The HDR examines broader challenges impacting human development, encompassing social, economic, and environmental factors.  Thus, all three statements contain inaccuracies, making option (a) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the agricultural sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) covers only Kharif crops and excludes Rabi crops.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any government oversight.
3.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the primary procuring agency for wheat and paddy under the MSP scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP scheme encompasses both Kharif and Rabi crops, as well as certain commercial crops. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  Government approval is essential. Statement 3 is correct. The FCI plays a central role in procuring wheat and paddy at MSPs. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2 concerning the scope of MSP coverage and the decision-making process.


**6. With reference to the  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF exclusively provides grants to farmers for agricultural infrastructure development.
2.  The AIF’s recent expansion includes provisions for integrated processing projects and convergence with PM-KUSUM.
3. The AIF credit guarantee coverage is solely provided by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The AIF provides loans, not just grants, and these are facilitated through banks and financial institutions with interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage. Statement 2 is correct.  The AIF's scope has indeed been expanded to include integrated processing projects and convergence with PM-KUSUM (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan).  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the CGTMSE is involved, NABARD’s subsidiary NAB Sanrakshan also extends credit guarantee coverage, particularly for Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to the Indian Microfinance sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals with annual incomes exceeding ₹3,00,000.
2. Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.
3. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹20 lakh under the "Tarun Plus" category to those who have previously availed and repaid loans under the "Tarun" category.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's definition specifies annual incomes *up to* ₹3,00,000 for microfinance loans, not exceeding that amount. Statement 2 is also incorrect. MFIs generally charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks due to higher perceived risk and operational costs. Statement 3 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget did enhance the PMMY loan limit to ₹20 lakh under the "Tarun Plus" category for those with a successful repayment history under the "Tarun" category. Consequently, only statement 3 is accurate.


**8. With reference to  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Capital adequacy is not a key parameter for monitoring the performance of UCBs.
2.  A UCB can be placed under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) if it breaches risk thresholds in areas like asset quality.
3.  A UCB exits PCA only after a single quarter of compliance with risk thresholds.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Capital adequacy, along with asset quality and profitability, are indeed key monitoring parameters for UCBs. Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs can be brought under PCA if they violate pre-defined risk thresholds related to capital, asset quality, and profitability. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Exit from PCA requires four consecutive quarters of compliance, not just one. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs primarily focus on acquiring performing assets from banks and financial institutions.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates ARCs under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002.
3. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ARCs primarily acquire *Non-Performing Assets* (NPAs), not performing assets, to help banks clean up their balance sheets. Statement 2 is correct. The RBI does indeed regulate ARCs under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. Statement 3 is incorrect. The maximum time limit for asset resolution by ARCs is 8 years, not 5 years. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**10. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  Appeals against the decisions of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) are directly filed in High Courts.
2. The Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) is available only for large corporate entities with defaults exceeding ₹1 crore.
3. The Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) handle appeals from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Appeals from NCLAT go to the Supreme Court, not High Courts.  Statement 2 is incorrect. PPIRP is available for corporate MSMEs with defaults of at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹1 crore. Statement 3 is incorrect. Appeals from DRTs go to the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), not the NCLT.  Therefore, all three statements are incorrect.


**1. With reference to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
2.  Microfinance Institutions typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.
3.  The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a framework to regulate Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating as MFIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households with an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  This is a crucial distinction highlighting the target demographic of microfinance initiatives. Exceeding this income threshold would typically place the individual outside the scope of microfinance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) usually charge *higher*, not lower, interest rates compared to commercial banks. This is due to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income individuals and the often informal nature of the lending process.  The higher interest rates, while sometimes criticized, are often necessary to maintain the financial viability of MFIs.

Statement 3 is correct. The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) did indeed recommend a regulatory framework for NBFCs operating as MFIs. This was a significant step towards formalizing the microfinance sector and ensuring responsible lending practices. The committee's recommendations aimed to balance the need for financial inclusion with the prevention of exploitation of borrowers.  The regulation of NBFC-MFIs is a key aspect of responsible financial inclusion in India.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMY provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.
2.  Loans under PMMY are categorized as Shishu, Kishore, Tarun, and Tarun Plus.
3.  The 2024 Union Budget reduced the loan limit for the Tarun Plus category to ₹10 lakh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While PMMY does provide loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, the 2024 Union Budget *increased* the loan limit to ₹20 lakh for the Tarun Plus category. The original limit was indeed ₹10 lakh, but this has been revised.  Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate in its current form.

Statement 2 is correct.  Loans under PMMY are indeed categorized into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun. The addition of "Tarun Plus" reflects an expansion of the scheme to cater to those who have successfully repaid previous loans. This categorization helps in targeting specific needs and risk profiles within the micro and small enterprise sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 2024 Union Budget *increased*, not reduced, the loan limit for the Tarun Plus category to ₹20 lakh. This reflects a policy shift to encourage further investment and growth within the target sector. The increase in the loan limit indicates a greater commitment to supporting the financial needs of these enterprises.


**3. With reference to the  Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMSY aims to reduce critical gaps in fish production and productivity, technology, and post-harvest infrastructure.
2.  The Rangeen Machhli app, developed under PMMSY, provides information on popular ornamental fish species in only four Indian languages.
3.  PMMSY includes the establishment of three incubation centers for promoting fisheries start-ups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PMMSY is a comprehensive scheme designed to address various aspects of the fisheries sector, including production, technology, and infrastructure.  This holistic approach is crucial for boosting the overall productivity and efficiency of the industry.  The scheme aims to make the sector more sustainable and competitive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rangeen Machhli app provides multilingual information in *eight*, not four, Indian languages. This highlights the scheme's commitment to reaching a wider audience and promoting awareness across different linguistic regions of the country.  The multilingual aspect increases accessibility and inclusivity.

Statement 3 is correct. PMMSY does indeed involve the establishment of three incubation centers aimed at fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the fisheries sector. These centers are designed to support start-ups and cooperatives, promoting growth and job creation within the industry.  Incubation centers play a key role in nurturing the growth of new ventures.


**4. With reference to India's steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 was higher than the world average.
2.  India primarily fulfills its coking coal requirements through domestic production.
3.  The steel sector is a significant contributor to India's carbon emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 was significantly *lower* than the world average (97.7 kg vs 219.3 kg). This indicates a considerable scope for growth in the domestic steel market.  The low per capita consumption suggests untapped potential for increased steel usage across various sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India largely fulfills its coking coal requirements through *costly imports*, primarily from Australia, not domestic production. This dependence on imports makes the steel sector vulnerable to fluctuations in global coal prices and supply chains. The reliance on imports is a major challenge for the sector's cost competitiveness.

Statement 3 is correct. The steel sector is indeed an extremely energy-intensive industry and a major contributor to global and India's carbon emissions. This poses significant environmental challenges and necessitates the adoption of sustainable production practices.  The carbon intensity of steel production is a key concern for environmental sustainability.


**5. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) actions to manage liquidity in the banking system, consider the following statements:**

1.  To inject liquidity, the RBI uses Open Market Operations (OMO) by selling government securities.
2.  The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is a market-determined rate that is always lower than the repo rate.
3.  Increasing the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) injects liquidity into the banking system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. To inject liquidity, the RBI buys, not sells, government securities through OMO. Selling securities withdraws liquidity from the system.  This is a fundamental tool of monetary policy used to manage the money supply and interest rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the VRR is generally lower than the repo rate, it is *not* always lower; it cannot be below the reverse repo rate.  The VRR provides a flexible mechanism for injecting liquidity when market conditions warrant a rate below the standard repo rate.  The relationship between VRR, repo rate, and reverse repo rate is crucial for understanding liquidity management.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Increasing the CRR and SLR *withdraws*, not injects, liquidity from the banking system.  These ratios represent the portion of deposits that banks must maintain with the RBI and as liquid assets, respectively.  Increasing these ratios reduces the amount of money banks have available for lending.  The impact of CRR and SLR changes on liquidity is a key concept in monetary policy.


**6. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is published bi-annually in January and July.
2. The FI-Index includes parameters related to banking, investments, insurance, and postal services, but excludes the pension sector.
3.  A higher FI-Index score indicates a greater level of financial inclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published *annually*, not bi-annually, typically in July. The annual publication allows for a comprehensive assessment of financial inclusion trends over a full year. The timing of the publication is important for policy-making and monitoring progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index *does* include the pension sector, in addition to banking, investments, insurance, and postal services.  A comprehensive index of financial inclusion must consider all major financial services to provide a holistic picture. The inclusion of the pension sector reflects the importance of retirement savings in overall financial well-being.

Statement 3 is correct. A higher FI-Index score indeed indicates a greater level of financial inclusion. The index provides a quantitative measure of the extent to which individuals and businesses have access to and utilize financial services. A higher score signifies improved access, usage, and quality of financial services.


**7. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. RB-IOS was launched in 2022.
2. RB-IOS covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), regardless of their asset size.
3.  The scheme aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022.  The year of launch is a significant fact to remember concerning the timeline of grievance redressal mechanisms.  The precise year is important for understanding the evolution of the regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RB-IOS covers only Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above, and those authorized to accept deposits or have customer interface.  The asset size threshold is a crucial aspect of the scheme's scope and coverage.  Not all NBFCs are included, reflecting a tiered approach to regulation.

Statement 3 is correct.  RB-IOS indeed aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints related to the services provided by regulated entities of the RBI.  The cost-free aspect is essential for ensuring that customers have accessible avenues for resolving grievances.  The accessibility of the scheme is a key feature for ensuring financial justice.


**8.  With reference to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement sets out minimum standards of protection for intellectual property rights for a period of 20 years.
2. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.
3. The TRIPS Agreement prohibits compulsory licensing for producing patented products or processes without the consent of the patent owner.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The TRIPS Agreement does not specify a uniform 20-year period for all intellectual property rights. The duration of protection varies depending on the type of intellectual property right (e.g., patents, copyrights, trademarks). The varying durations reflect the different nature and scope of protection for various intellectual property rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement does incorporate key provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions. This reflects an attempt to harmonize international standards for intellectual property rights.  The incorporation of these conventions is a significant aspect of the agreement's international framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement *allows* for compulsory licensing under certain circumstances, particularly to address public health concerns in developing countries.  Compulsory licensing provides a mechanism for governments to override patent rights in specific situations of national interest.  This flexibility is a crucial aspect of the TRIPS Agreement’s attempt to balance intellectual property rights with broader societal needs.


**9. With reference to the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. From independence to economic liberalization, investment as a percentage of GDP consistently remained above 20%.
2. Private investment, as a percentage of GDP, reached its lowest point in 2019-20.
3.  The "cobweb phenomenon" refers to cyclical price fluctuations in certain goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. From independence to economic liberalization, investment as a percentage of GDP was *slightly below or above 10%*, not consistently above 20%. This reflects the lower levels of investment during the pre-liberalization era.  The significant increase in investment only occurred after the economic reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Private investment as a percentage of GDP hit its lowest point in 2020-21, not 2019-20.  The precise year of the lowest point is a significant detail that requires accurate recall.  The year 2020-21 was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted investment activity.

Statement 3 is correct. The "cobweb phenomenon" does indeed refer to cyclical price fluctuations in certain goods, often agricultural products, due to lags between production decisions and market prices.  Understanding the cobweb phenomenon is important for analyzing market dynamics in certain sectors.  It illustrates the complexities of supply and demand interactions over time.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fruits and vegetables account for *90%*, not less than 80%, of total horticulture production in India.  This reflects the dominance of these two categories within the horticulture sector. The high proportion of fruits and vegetables is important for understanding the sector's composition and market dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. India is indeed ranked first globally in the production of bananas, mangoes, and papayas.  This highlights India's significant role in the global fruit market.  The ranking underscores the country's strengths in producing these specific fruits.

Statement 3 is correct. The MIDH does include sub-schemes like the NHB and CDB.  These sub-schemes are crucial for the holistic development of the horticulture sector.

2. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS) that could be integrated into Project Nexus.
3. Project Nexus aims to achieve G20 targets by enabling cheaper, faster, more transparent, and accessible cross-border payments, and is expected to go live by 2026.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative involving several countries, not just India and Singapore.  It aims to interlink domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across multiple nations to facilitate cross-border payments.  The inclusion of multiple ASEAN countries alongside India highlights its multilateral nature.

Statement 2 is correct. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a prime example of an Instant Payments System (IPS).  The question correctly identifies UPI as a relevant technology within the context of instant cross-border payments facilitated by Project Nexus.  The passage clearly defines IPS and provides UPI as an illustrative example.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Project Nexus aims to achieve G20 targets regarding cross-border payments and provides a projected launch date of 2026.  This aligns directly with the statement's assertion.  The initiative's goals of increased efficiency, transparency, and accessibility are central to its design and are accurately reflected in the statement.


**2. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI's (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, amended the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 1996.
2. A Foreign Venture Capital Investor (FVCI) is an investor incorporated in India, registered under FVCI Regulations and invests in listed companies.
3. Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) are used for low-risk, low-return investments in return for debt stakes in businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the amendment was to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, not 1996.  This seemingly minor detail demonstrates the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  Attention to the year of the regulation is crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect on multiple counts.  First, FVCIs are incorporated *outside* India, not within. Second, FVCIs invest in *unlisted* companies and venture capital undertakings, not listed ones.  The statement misrepresents both the location of incorporation and the type of investment made by FVCIs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) are designed for *high-risk, high-return* investments, not low-risk, low-return.  The investment strategy of VCFs centers on the potential for substantial gains despite inherent risks, a fundamental aspect of venture capital.  The statement fundamentally mischaracterizes the risk profile and return expectations associated with VCFs.


**3. With reference to India's space economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) is a private sector company under the Department of Space (DoS) responsible for promoting space activities of Government Entities (GEs).
2. The Indian Space Association (ISpA) was established in 2010 as an apex non-profit industry body to develop the private space industry in India.
3. The Budget 2024-25 allocated Rs. 1,000 crore as a venture capital fund to promote the space economy, supplementing initiatives like the Seed fund scheme (2023).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IN-SPACe is an *autonomous agency*, not a private sector company, under the DoS.  Its role is to promote and supervise the space activities of *Non-Government Entities (NGEs)*, not Government Entities (GEs). The statement incorrectly identifies both the nature of IN-SPACe and the entities it interacts with.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ISpA was established in 2020, not 2010. This error in the founding year is a common type of factual inaccuracy that can easily lead to incorrect answers in UPSC-style questions.  Accuracy in dates and timelines is essential.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage clearly states that Budget 2024-25 allocated Rs. 1,000 crore for a venture capital fund to support space tech startups and SMEs, building upon the Seed fund scheme launched in 2023.  This statement accurately reflects the budgetary allocation and its purpose.

1. PACS are registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are administered by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS.
3.  PACS are the grassroot-level arms of the short-term cooperative credit structure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are *not* regulated by the RBI.  This statement misrepresents the legal framework governing PACS.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that DCCBs are a crucial source of funds for PACS.  This statement accurately reflects the financial relationship between these two entities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's average annual cattle productivity (1777 kg/animal/year) is significantly lower than the global average (2699 kg/animal/year). The statement misrepresents the actual productivity figures. While the NADCP aims to improve animal health, it hasn't yet bridged this productivity gap.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Pandemic Fund Project, a $25 million initiative funded by the G20, explicitly focuses on "Animal Health Security Strengthening in India for Pandemic Preparedness and Response."  It aims to enhance capacity to respond to animal health threats and pandemics, which directly contradicts the statement.


**3. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded through a levy on licensees' Adjusted Gross Revenue.
2.  The DBN's primary objective is to fund telecom infrastructure development in urban areas to ensure high-speed internet access for all citizens.
3. The DBN funds are managed and disbursed directly by the private sector telecom companies to ensure efficient allocation and utilization of resources.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) was indeed established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replacing the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). The USOF was funded by a levy (5% of Adjusted Gross Revenue) on licensees of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DBN's primary aim is to fund telecom schemes in underserved remote and rural areas to provide affordable access to telecom services.  The statement misrepresents the target beneficiaries of the fund.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The DBN funds are not managed or disbursed by private sector telecom companies.  The management and disbursement are under the purview of the government, ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation and utilization of resources.  The statement incorrectly attributes this responsibility to the private sector.


**4. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 MPI report, jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI, indicates that India has the highest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty globally.
2. The report covers 112 countries and reveals that approximately 18% of the global population lives in acute multidimensional poverty.
3. The MPI primarily measures poverty based solely on income levels, disregarding other crucial dimensions of well-being.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, a collaborative effort by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), indeed highlights that India has the largest number of people (234 million) living in acute multidimensional poverty.

Statement 2 is also correct. The report encompasses data from 112 countries, revealing that approximately 1.1 billion people (around 18% of the global population) experience acute multidimensional poverty.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MPI is a multidimensional measure of poverty, encompassing various dimensions beyond income, including health, education, and living standards.  It's a holistic approach that provides a more comprehensive understanding of poverty than income-based measures alone.  The statement mischaracterizes the MPI's scope.


**5. With reference to the  Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement aims to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to the depletion of the world's fish stocks and has been accepted by all WTO members.
2.  Developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are granted a transition period of 2 years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement under Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT).
3.  India is among the countries that have fully ratified and implemented the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb harmful subsidies contributing to fish stock depletion, it has *not* been accepted by all WTO members.  Its entry into force requires ratification by two-thirds of WTO members, a threshold that had not been reached as of December 2024.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Agreement does provide a transition period of 2 years under Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) for developing countries and LDCs. This acknowledges the varying capacities and needs of different nations in adapting to the new regulations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India, as of December 2024, was not a party to the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.  India had expressed concerns and reservations regarding the agreement's provisions, particularly concerning its impact on developing nations.

1.  The ICI includes nine core industries in its calculation.
2.  Petroleum refinery products have the lowest weight in the ICI calculation.
3.  The ICI is released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The ICI includes eight, not nine, core industries. Petroleum refinery products have the *highest*, not lowest, weight. Finally, the ICI is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**1. With reference to the Agri Stack initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agri Stack's "Kisan ki Pehchaan" component aims to provide a digital identity for all farmers in India within two years, primarily using Aadhaar data for verification.
2.  The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS to provide real-time information on crop conditions and weather patterns, but excludes soil moisture data.
3.  Soil Profile Mapping under the Agri Stack utilizes data from the Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES) to predict crop yields, and this data is collected annually across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Agri Stack does aim to create digital identities for farmers, the target is 11 crore farmers over three years, not two years.  The statement also incorrectly implies exclusive use of Aadhaar; the Farmer ID is a trusted digital identity but not necessarily solely reliant on Aadhaar.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Krishi DSS uses RISAT-1A and VEDAS for real-time agricultural information, including crop conditions and weather patterns. However, while soil moisture is a crucial factor, the statement's exclusion of it doesn't render the core functionality incorrect.  The DSS integrates multiple data sources, and the omission of one specific data point doesn't invalidate the overall function.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The DGCES provides yield estimates, but the statement incorrectly states that this data is collected annually across all states. The frequency and geographical coverage may vary. The connection between Soil Profile Mapping and DGCES is accurate, but the details about the data collection process are overstated.


**2. With reference to the challenges and initiatives in India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's average annual cattle productivity is significantly lower than the global average due primarily to widespread disease outbreaks like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, and the low adoption of advanced breeding techniques.
2.  The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" initiatives aim to improve livestock traceability and disease surveillance, but their implementation has been hampered by high costs and a lack of farmer awareness.
3.  India's high antibiotic use in animals, ranking it 4th globally, is primarily driven by the lack of stringent regulations and the widespread availability of inexpensive antibiotics, leading to significant concerns about antimicrobial resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The productivity gap between Indian and global cattle averages is significant and directly linked to disease prevalence (FMD, Brucellosis) and limited adoption of advanced breeding practices.  These factors significantly impact milk and meat production.

Statement 2 is partially correct but overstates the challenges. While cost and awareness are potential hurdles, the statement presents them as the primary obstacles, neglecting other crucial factors like technological limitations and infrastructure deficiencies in data collection and management.

Statement 3 is correct.  India's high antibiotic use is a serious concern, and the reasons cited – lax regulations and easy access to inexpensive antibiotics – are accurate and contribute significantly to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.


**3. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and its implications for India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Global MPI report indicates that India has the highest number of people living in multidimensional poverty globally, exceeding the combined total of all other countries.
2.  While India's poverty headcount ratio has significantly decreased, the rate of decline has been slower in relatively wealthier states, suggesting that poverty reduction efforts have disproportionately benefited poorer states.
3.  Despite the substantial reduction in India's poverty headcount ratio, the country is still not on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 1.2 of halving multidimensional poverty by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India has a very large number of people in multidimensional poverty, the statement exaggerates this by claiming it exceeds the combined total of all other countries.  The MPI report shows a substantial number in India but doesn't imply this extreme disparity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that *poorer* states show a *faster* decline in poverty, indicating that poverty reduction has been more effective in those areas, not wealthier states as the statement suggests. This contradicts the statement's assertion.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The report explicitly states that India is on track to achieve SDG Target 1.2 *ahead* of 2030.  The statement wrongly asserts the opposite.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural export policy and performance, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023-24, India's agricultural exports registered a significant decline, falling short of the ambitious target set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy, mainly due to global economic slowdown and reduced demand from major importing countries.
2.  Rice accounts for the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices, while vegetable oil constitutes the largest share of its agricultural imports, followed by pulses and fruits & vegetables.
3.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) primarily focuses on improving cold chain infrastructure and reducing post-harvest losses, while the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme focuses on diversification of export markets and product range.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly indicates a decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24, falling short of the target, and attributes this to a decline in global demand and economic slowdown.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that rice is the largest agricultural export, followed by marine products and spices, and that vegetable oil is the largest agricultural import, followed by pulses and fruits & vegetables.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While TIES does involve infrastructure improvements, including cold chains, it is not solely focused on post-harvest losses.  Similarly, MAI aims to improve market access, but it is not exclusively about diversification.  The statement oversimplifies the scope and objectives of both schemes.


**5. With reference to the concept of the "middle-income trap" and India's economic prospects, consider the following statements:**

1.  The World Bank's World Development Report 2024 suggests that India is at high risk of falling into the middle-income trap due to its relatively low per capita GDP compared to other middle-income countries and its dependence on low-value-added manufacturing.
2.  The "middle-income trap" refers to a situation where a country's economic growth stagnates at middle-income levels due to a lack of technological innovation and insufficient investment in human capital, preventing it from transitioning to high-income status.
3.  The World Bank's recommended "3i strategy" (Investment, Infusion of global technologies, Innovation) for countries to avoid the middle-income trap emphasizes the importance of creative destruction, which involves replacing outdated industries and technologies with newer, more efficient ones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplifies the situation.  While the report does flag the risk of the middle-income trap for India,  it doesn't solely attribute it to low per capita GDP and dependence on low-value-added manufacturing. Other factors, such as institutional weaknesses and lack of innovation, are also important.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of the middle-income trap accurately reflects the challenges faced by countries struggling to transition to high-income status due to factors like technological stagnation and human capital deficits.

Statement 3 is correct. The "3i strategy" and the role of creative destruction in facilitating the transition to higher income levels are accurately described in the provided text.


**6. With reference to seaweed farming in India and its significance, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is considered a part of aquaculture, and the aquaculture sector contributes a significant portion (more than 5%) of India's GDP, making it a major contributor to the national economy.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, primarily through the promotion of offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
3.  Seaweed farming is significant for its economic value due to its use in food products and pharmaceuticals, and also for its environmental benefits, such as carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% of India's GDP, not more than 5%.  This significantly understates the contribution relative to the claim in the statement.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana’s target and focus on offshore cultivation in the Andaman region are accurate.  However, the statement implies that the entire target will be achieved solely through Andaman and Nicobar Islands cultivation, which might be an oversimplification.

Statement 3 is correct. The economic and environmental significance of seaweed farming, as described in the statement, is accurately reflected in the text.  The uses in food and pharmaceuticals, and the environmental benefits of carbon sequestration, are key points.


**7. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is the minimum price at which the government procures agricultural produce from farmers, and it is calculated based solely on the A2+FL cost of production recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).
2. The MSP currently covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra), with additional MSPs fixed for Toria and de-husked coconut based on their respective primary crop MSPs.
3.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole nodal agency responsible for procuring all MSP-covered crops across the country, ensuring uniformity in procurement operations and price realization for farmers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP does recommend MSP based on production costs, the statement incorrectly states that it's *solely* based on A2+FL cost.  The calculation considers multiple factors, and the statement's simplification is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The number of MSP-covered crops, their categorization (Kharif, Rabi, commercial), and the inclusion of Toria and de-husked coconut are all accurately presented.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While FCI is a major procuring agency, it's not the *sole* agency responsible for procuring all MSP-covered crops.  Other state-level agencies also participate in procurement operations, and the statement's claim of complete uniformity is an oversimplification.


**8. With reference to India's silk production and the Central Silk Board, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world's largest producer of silk, contributing over 50% of global silk production, with Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh being the leading silk-producing states.
2. The Central Silk Board's platinum jubilee celebration highlighted India's dominance in global silk production and its efforts to promote sustainable and ethical silk farming practices.
3.  India produces all varieties of silk – Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga – showcasing its diverse silk production capabilities and catering to a wide range of consumer preferences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India is the *second* largest producer of silk, not the largest, contributing around 42% of global production, not over 50%. The statement exaggerates India's share of global production and presents an inaccurate ranking.

Statement 2 is correct. The platinum jubilee celebration of the Central Silk Board did highlight India's significant role in global silk production and the focus on sustainable practices is consistent with current industry trends.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately states that India produces all four major varieties of silk mentioned.  This diversity is a key aspect of India's silk industry.



**1. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases.
2.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project, spearheaded by DFCCIL, seeks to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% in 2019 to 45% by 2030, as per the National Rail Plan 2030.
3.  Vadhavan Port, upon completion, will become India's largest deep-water port and the 14th major port in the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharatmala Pariyojana is a flagship program of the Indian government aimed at significantly expanding and improving the national highway network.  The project's target of constructing approximately 65,000 km of highways across two phases is well-documented.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project is a crucial initiative under the National Rail Plan 2030 to enhance the efficiency of freight transportation in India.  DFCCIL, a special purpose vehicle of Indian Railways, plays a central role in the planning, development, and operation of these corridors. The goal of increasing the share of rail freight traffic to 45% by 2030 is a stated objective of the plan.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Vadhvan Port is indeed planned as a major port, and will be one of India's largest container ports,  the provided text states it will be the 13th major port, not the 14th.  Furthermore, while it is designed to be a deep-water port, it is not definitively stated to be the *largest* deep-water port in India. The claim requires more precise information to be verified.  Therefore, this statement contains inaccuracies.



**2. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) and PM GatiShakti are initiatives aimed at improving the efficiency of India's freight transport.
2. The Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index are tools designed to improve logistics efficiency, but the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is a World Bank initiative.
3. The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) with Russia allows both militaries access to each other’s logistics and support facilities, and India has similar agreements with the US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  LEEP and PM GatiShakti are indeed government initiatives directly focused on improving the efficiency of India's freight transportation system.  These programs aim to streamline logistics processes and reduce bottlenecks.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading.  ULIP and LEADS are domestic Indian initiatives aiming to improve logistics efficiency. However, it incorrectly states that the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is a World Bank initiative *only*. While the LPI *is* a World Bank initiative, the statement fails to acknowledge that India is actively participating in and seeking to improve its ranking within this index. This omission makes the statement inaccurate in its presentation.

Statement 3 is correct. The RELOS agreement with Russia and similar agreements with other named countries are factual and accurately described. These agreements provide crucial logistical support for military operations.


**3. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) covers 24 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 4 commercial crops.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
3.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform primarily holds datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown, and KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for yield estimation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. The HDR, released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 1990, primarily focuses on examining major global challenges affecting human development and proposing policy recommendations.  The Human Development Index (HDI) is a secondary component of the report.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII), a key component of the HDR, measures gender inequalities across three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity, while the Gender Development Index (GDI) measures disparities in HDI achievements between genders.
3. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) is a measure of inequality that adjusts the HDI downwards to reflect the loss in human development due to inequality;  it does not consider planetary pressures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the HDI is the core of the HDR, not a secondary component. The HDR's central purpose is to present and analyze the HDI, along with other indices that provide a more nuanced picture of human development.  The report uses the HDI as a primary framework for evaluating progress and identifying challenges.

Statement 2 is correct. The GII and GDI are indeed key components of the HDR, measuring gender inequalities in the specified dimensions. The GII assesses inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and economic participation, while the GDI focuses on comparing HDI achievements between men and women.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the IHDI does adjust the HDI for inequality, the description is incomplete. The Planetary pressures-adjusted HDI is a separate index within the HDR, accounting for environmental sustainability concerns and intergenerational equity, not the IHDI.  The IHDI solely focuses on the impact of inequality on human development.


**2. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 MPI report, published jointly by the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), found that less than 1 billion people globally live in acute multidimensional poverty.
2.  According to the 2024 MPI report, India had the second-largest number of people living in extreme poverty.
3.  The MPI measures poverty using a multidimensional approach, considering factors beyond just income,  such as health, education, and living standards, to provide a holistic assessment of poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report indicated that approximately 1.1 billion people (around 18%) lived in acute multidimensional poverty across the 112 countries assessed, a significant figure exceeding the statement's claim.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report stated that India had the largest number of people (234 million) living in acute multidimensional poverty, not the second largest.

Statement 3 is correct. The MPI fundamentally departs from traditional income-based poverty measures. It uses a multidimensional approach, incorporating various factors beyond income to paint a more comprehensive picture of poverty.  This includes indicators related to health, education, and living standards, providing a more nuanced understanding of deprivation.


**3. With reference to Inheritance Tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inheritance tax, unlike estate tax, is levied on the total value of a deceased person's assets.  Currently, India does not have an inheritance tax system.
2.  India previously imposed an estate duty, which was abolished in 1985 due to its high tax rates (up to 85%), making it unpopular.  Similar to estate duty, gift tax and wealth tax were also abolished in India.
3.  The reintroduction of gift tax in 2004 in India stipulated that any gift exceeding Rs. 50,000 in a financial year is added to a recipient's income and taxed according to the income tax slab, with several exceptions for close relatives, weddings, etc.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Inheritance tax is levied on inherited assets, not the total value of a deceased person's estate (which is the basis for estate tax).  While India currently lacks an inheritance tax, the statement's description of the tax itself is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  India did have an estate duty, which was repealed due to its high tax rates and unpopularity. The statement accurately reflects the history of estate duty, gift tax, and wealth tax in India.

Statement 3 is mostly correct but requires clarification.  While the basic premise of the gift tax rules is accurate, the threshold of Rs. 50,000 might not be entirely precise depending on the year and specific regulations.  However, the core idea of the gift tax's application and the inclusion of exceptions is correct.  The minor inaccuracy does not negate the overall correctness of the statement.



**4. Consider the following statements about Wealth and Income Inequality in India:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PCA framework for UCBs is indeed effective from April 1, 2025, replacing the SAF, and its application excludes UCBs under AID.  Statement 2 is also correct. Capital, asset quality, and profitability are the key monitored areas, and consistent adherence to thresholds over four consecutive quarters is a condition for exiting PCA.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While NUCFDC supports UCBs through various means, it doesn't directly implement the PCA framework. The RBI retains the primary responsibility for implementing and monitoring the PCA framework. NUCFDC's role is primarily focused on providing liquidity, capital support, regulatory compliance assistance, and technological solutions to strengthen the UCB sector, not direct intervention in PCA implementation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

3.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, empowers secured creditors to initiate insolvency proceedings against borrowers who default on loan repayments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A loan is classified as an NPA if it's overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days. Statement 2 is correct. The FSR, published by the RBI, indeed provides an assessment of NPAs, including GNPA and Net NPA data for Scheduled Commercial Banks. Statement 3 is incorrect. The SARFAESI Act, 2002, allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral but doesn't directly initiate insolvency proceedings.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, handles insolvency resolution. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs), consider the following statements:**

1. An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure its financial sustainability and independence.

3. At least one-third of the members of the SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent to maintain objectivity and avoid conflicts of interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SROs are required to be not-for-profit companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While compliance is important, SROs also aim to foster a compliance culture, support smaller entities, and act as a collective voice for their members.  Statement 3 is correct.  The requirement for independent directors on the SRO board is to ensure objectivity and mitigate conflicts of interest.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.



**1. With reference to agricultural technology initiatives in India, consider the following statements:**

1. KISAN uses satellite imagery and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for crop yield prediction, but not Artificial Intelligence (AI).
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) primarily focuses on farmer identity, farm location, and crop-sown data, excluding livestock data.
3. Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) utilizes AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making, primarily concerning crop production.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because KISAN does indeed leverage AI alongside satellite imagery and GIS for improved yield estimation.  The integration of AI allows for more sophisticated analysis of the data collected through remote sensing.  Statement 2 is correct. ADeX's core function is the compilation and provision of farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crop-sown data. While livestock data might be valuable, it's not a primary component of ADeX. Statement 3 is correct. The Krishi ICCC explicitly uses AI, remote sensing, and GIS to facilitate data-driven decision-making in agriculture, predominantly focusing on crop management and production optimization.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**2. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. MSP is determined solely by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), considering only production costs.
2. The MSP covers only Kharif and Rabi crops, excluding commercial crops like jute and copra.
3. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FCI is a crucial procuring agency for certain crops, the MSP is not determined solely by them.  The CACP plays a pivotal role in recommending MSPs based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors including production costs, market prices, and farmer welfare.  Furthermore, the calculation of MSP involves considering more than just production costs. Statement 2 is incorrect. The MSP framework in India encompasses a broader range of crops, including Kharif, Rabi, and also commercial crops like jute and copra.  The inclusion of these commercial crops underscores the government's commitment to supporting a wider spectrum of agricultural producers. Statement 3 is correct. The CACP, an expert body, submits its recommendations to the CCEA, which ultimately approves the MSPs.  This reflects a structured decision-making process ensuring that MSP announcements are informed and aligned with broader economic considerations.



**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports exceeded the target of $60 billion by 2022.
2.  Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products.
3.  Vegetable oil constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural imports, followed by pulses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports fell short of the $60 billion target set for 2022.  This highlights a gap between the ambitious goal and the actual performance of the agricultural export sector. Statement 2 is correct. According to the text, rice accounts for a significant portion (21%) of India's total agricultural exports, exceeding the share contributed by marine products (15%).  This reflects the importance of rice in India's agricultural export basket. Statement 3 is also correct. The text indicates that vegetable oil comprises the largest share (45%) of India's agricultural imports, followed by pulses (11%). This highlights India's reliance on imports for meeting its domestic demand for vegetable oils.


**4. With reference to Cooperative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cooperative banks accept deposits from and lend to the general public, competing directly with commercial banks.
2.  A minimum of two hundred members and net owned funds of ten lakh rupees or more are mandatory criteria for establishing a cooperative bank.
3.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all aspects of cooperative banks, including PACS.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cooperative banks, by their nature, primarily serve their members, focusing on mutual benefit and not directly competing with commercial banks in the broader public market. This fundamental difference distinguishes their operations and clientele. Statement 2 is correct.  The given text clearly specifies the minimum membership (two hundred) and net owned funds (ten lakh rupees) as essential criteria for establishing a cooperative bank. These requirements ensure a certain level of financial stability and operational capacity. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the RBI does regulate certain aspects of some cooperative banks, particularly State Cooperative Banks (SCBs) and District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs),  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) are largely regulated under state cooperative societies acts, and not directly under RBI purview.


**5. With reference to the ISI Mark in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to ensure product quality and safety.
2. The Central Government mandates the ISI mark for all products sold in India, regardless of their nature.
3. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) develops and manages the ISI mark scheme.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark, while ensuring product quality and safety, is not issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Instead, it's managed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).  The ministry plays a role in policy formulation but not the direct issuance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not mandatory for all products sold in India. The government selectively mandates it for specific products deemed crucial for public safety and quality, through Quality Control Orders (QCOs).  This targeted approach focuses on high-risk or essential goods. Statement 3 is correct. The BIS, established under the BIS Act, 2016, is the national standards body in India.  It's responsible for developing, managing, and overseeing the ISI mark scheme, ensuring consistent product quality and safety standards.


**6. With reference to "Green Shoots" in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. Green shoots refer to signs of economic recovery after a period of stagnation, specifically in the agricultural sector.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified the rural economy as a significant driver of green shoots in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector.
3. Green shoots are exclusively used to describe the positive indicators within the manufacturing sector.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While green shoots can indeed indicate agricultural sector recovery, their application is broader, encompassing any economic sector showing signs of growth after a downturn. The term isn't limited to agriculture alone. Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's observation highlights the rural economy's role in driving positive growth indicators within the FMCG sector, indicating a broader economic recovery.  This highlights the interconnectedness of different economic sectors. Statement 3 is incorrect. Green shoots are not limited to the manufacturing sector. They can appear in any sector experiencing growth after a period of decline, signifying a broader economic revival. The term is a general indicator of economic recovery, not confined to a specific sector.


**7. With reference to household savings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Household savings are solely categorized as financial savings, including currency and deposits.
2.  A decline in financial savings directly impacts government borrowing, leading to reduced public spending.
3.  The household savings rate is calculated as a ratio of household savings to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Household savings are categorized into both financial and physical savings.  Financial savings include currency, deposits, and life insurance funds, while physical savings encompass physical assets, including gold and silver. The statement overlooks the significant contribution of physical savings to the overall household savings pool. Statement 2 is incorrect. While a decline in financial savings can indirectly affect government borrowing (as a portion of household financial savings goes toward government borrowings),  it doesn't directly lead to reduced public spending.  Other sources of government funding exist, and the impact isn't solely and directly determined by household financial savings. Statement 3 is correct. The household savings rate is indeed expressed as the ratio of household savings to the GDP.  This ratio provides a crucial indicator of the household sector's contribution to overall national savings and economic growth.


**8. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST compensation cess was levied on all goods and services to compensate states for revenue loss.
2.  The GST Council is responsible for deciding on the taxation of luxury, sin, and demerit goods after the compensation cess ends.
3.  Excise duty on alcohol is now collected by the Central Government and is called "Central Excise" duty.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST compensation cess was levied specifically on luxury, sin, and demerit goods to compensate states for revenue losses following the implementation of the GST.  It wasn't a universal levy on all goods and services. Statement 2 is correct. The GST Council, as the apex decision-making body for GST matters, is tasked with determining the taxation structure for luxury, sin, and demerit goods once the compensation cess period concludes. This is a crucial aspect of ongoing GST policy development. Statement 3 is incorrect. Excise duty on alcohol is collected by the State Governments, not the Central Government, and is referred to as "State Excise" duty, reflecting the decentralized nature of alcohol taxation in India.


**9. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where import duties on finished goods are higher than on input goods.
2.  IDS creates working capital issues for taxpayers due to blocked Input Tax Credit (ITC).
3.  IDS benefits domestic industries by making imported products more expensive.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDS is characterized by import duties or GST rates on input goods being *higher* than on finished goods, not the other way around.  This creates a situation where the tax paid on inputs exceeds the tax collected on sales, leading to various economic challenges. Statement 2 is correct.  The higher tax burden on inputs under IDS results in a build-up of ITC, which remains unutilized until the finished goods are sold. This ties up working capital, impacting businesses' operational efficiency and financial flexibility. Statement 3 is incorrect. IDS actually *harms* domestic industries.  The higher cost of inputs makes domestically produced goods more expensive, hindering their competitiveness in both domestic and international markets.  It puts them at a disadvantage compared to imported goods with lower effective tax rates.


**10. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recent amendments to LTCG tax abolished indexation benefits for all properties, regardless of acquisition date.
2.  The grandfather clause allows properties acquired before a specified cutoff date to benefit from indexation.
3.  Indexation benefits reduce the taxable capital gains by adjusting for inflation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While amendments to LTCG tax did abolish indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* a specific date,  it didn't apply retroactively to all properties, regardless of acquisition date.  A grandfather clause was included to protect certain existing investments. Statement 2 is correct. The grandfather clause is a crucial element of the LTCG tax amendments, allowing properties acquired before the specified cutoff date to retain the benefit of indexation.  This prevents a sudden and potentially disruptive change in tax liabilities for long-term investments. Statement 3 is correct. Indexation adjusts the cost basis of an asset to account for inflation, thereby reducing the taxable capital gains. This ensures that capital gains are not artificially inflated due to the effects of inflation over time, leading to a fairer tax calculation.


**11. With reference to the  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. PMGS NMP is solely based on proprietary software developed by the Indian Railways.
2. PMGS NMP integrates data from various ministries, including those related to infrastructure projects such as Bharatmala and Sagarmala.
3. PMGS NMP utilizes GIS technology and ISRO satellite imagery.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP is not built on proprietary software developed by the Indian Railways. It leverages open-source technology and is hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud platform. This ensures accessibility and interoperability. Statement 2 is correct. A core strength of PMGS NMP is its integration of data from multiple ministries, including those overseeing major infrastructure projects like Bharatmala (roads) and Sagarmala (ports). This integrated approach improves coordination and planning efficiency. Statement 3 is correct. The PMGS NMP utilizes GIS technology and ISRO satellite imagery to provide a comprehensive spatial view of infrastructure projects.  The use of satellite imagery enhances accuracy and detail in planning and monitoring.


**12. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce public investment in infrastructure.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
3. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's primary goal is not to reduce public investment, but rather to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets. This approach aims to leverage private sector capital to fund infrastructure development without solely relying on government expenditure. Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee serves as a crucial body for evaluating the viability and effectiveness of central sector PPP projects.  This ensures that projects meet certain standards before proceeding. Statement 3 is correct. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs holds a key role in formulating and guiding policies related to PPPs in India. This ensures a coordinated and strategic approach to PPP implementation.


**13. With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Inclusive Framework primarily targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to prevent tax avoidance.
2.  Pillar One focuses on reallocating profits of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to countries where their consumers are located.
3.  Pillar Two aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for all businesses, including SMEs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS primarily targets large multinational enterprises (MNEs), not SMEs.  The focus is on addressing tax avoidance strategies employed by large corporations with complex international operations. Statement 2 is correct. Pillar One of the Inclusive Framework is specifically designed to reallocate a portion of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the countries where their consumers reside. This addresses the issue of profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Pillar Two aims to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, this applies to MNEs, not all businesses.  SMEs are generally not subject to the same level of scrutiny and regulations under this framework.


**14. With reference to Duty Drawback in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Duty Drawback is a scheme under the Income Tax Act, 1961, aimed at reducing the tax burden on exporters.
2.  Duty Drawback rebates customs duty on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods.
3.  The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) electronically disburses duty drawback amounts to exporters' bank accounts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Duty Drawback is not a scheme under the Income Tax Act, 1961.  It operates under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, specifically addressing customs duties, not income tax.  The statement incorrectly links it to the wrong legislation. Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of Duty Drawback is the rebate on customs duties paid on imported materials used in producing goods for export. This helps exporters to remain competitive in the global market. Statement 3 is correct. The CBIC utilizes the Public Finance Management System to electronically transfer duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts.  This streamlined process improves efficiency and transparency in the disbursement of refunds.


**15. With reference to Windfall Tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Windfall tax is levied on all industries irrespective of their profitability.
2.  Windfall tax is imposed on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favorable market conditions.
3.  The revenue generated from windfall tax is primarily used to fund social welfare programs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Windfall tax is not levied on all industries. It is selectively applied to specific sectors that experience unusually high profits due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden surge in global commodity prices.  This targeted approach focuses on industries benefiting disproportionately from external factors. Statement 2 is correct. Windfall tax is designed to capture a portion of the extraordinary profits earned by certain industries during periods of favorable economic conditions or unexpected market booms.  This aims to share the benefits with the government and potentially fund public initiatives.  Statement 3 is partially true but not explicitly stated in the provided text. While the revenue from windfall tax can be used for various purposes, including social welfare programs, the specific allocation is not explicitly defined.  The statement makes an assumption that is not fully supported.


**16. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy.
3.  The RBI is the sole regulatory authority for all CRAs in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While several CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI, this is not universally true for all CRAs.  The accreditation by the RBI is specific to their role in assessing bank loans, and not all CRAs undertake this function. Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulations for CRAs require transparent disclosure of their rating criteria, methodologies, default recognition policies, and guidelines for conflict of interest management. This is crucial for maintaining credibility and investor confidence. Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI and SEBI share regulatory oversight of CRAs, but the RBI's authority is limited to specific aspects, such as accreditation for rating bank loans. SEBI's jurisdiction is broader, covering other aspects of CRA operations.


**17. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds that allow investment in infrastructure projects.
2.  InvITs are exclusively funded by government grants and subsidies.
3.  The sponsors of InvITs are not recognized as borrowers under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. InvITs are indeed investment vehicles designed to facilitate investments in infrastructure projects.  They provide a mechanism for pooling capital from multiple investors and channeling it into large-scale infrastructure development.  This is similar in structure to a mutual fund. Statement 2 is incorrect. InvITs are not exclusively funded by government grants and subsidies. They attract funding from a variety of sources, including private investors, institutional investors, and even some government participation, but are not exclusively dependent on such funding. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.  This aspect is important for the legal framework governing the security and recovery of loans associated with InvIT investments in infrastructure projects.



**18. With reference to Jute cultivation and the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The JCI was established in 1971 to promote the export of jute products.
2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging only for agricultural products.
3. The JCI implements the Jute I-CARE project, focusing on mechanization in jute farming and accelerated retting.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the JCI was established in 1971, its primary focus was not solely on promoting jute exports. Its main function was to provide price support to jute farmers and stabilize the jute market, which indirectly helps exports. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging for several commodities, not just agricultural products.  The scope of the act is broader than solely agricultural goods. Statement 3 is correct. The JCI actively implements the Jute I-CARE project, which aims to improve jute cultivation through mechanization and advanced retting techniques using microbial consortia. This is a key initiative for enhancing jute production efficiency.


**19. With reference to NABARD's All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFIS measures financial inclusion based solely on the number of bank accounts held by rural households.
2. NAFIS was launched in 2016-17 to provide a comprehensive overview of rural livelihoods and financial inclusion.
3. The NAFINDEX, based on NAFIS data, measures financial inclusion by considering access, usage, and quality of financial services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS's measurement of financial inclusion is not limited to simply counting bank accounts.  It encompasses a wider range of financial services, including access to credit, insurance, and pension schemes.  The statement oversimplifies the scope of NAFIS. Statement 2 is correct. NAFIS was indeed launched in 2016-17 to offer a detailed assessment of rural financial inclusion and livelihoods. This comprehensive approach provides a valuable picture of the financial landscape in rural areas. Statement 3 is correct. The NAFINDEX, derived from NAFIS data, uses a multi-dimensional approach to assess financial inclusion, considering aspects of access, usage, and the quality of financial services.  This provides a more nuanced understanding than a simple count of bank accounts.


**20. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. PACS are the grassroots-level arms of the short-term cooperative credit structure.
3. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a significant role in providing funds to PACS.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are not registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are not directly regulated by the RBI. They are registered under state cooperative societies acts and are primarily overseen by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies. Statement 2 is correct. PACS form the foundational level of the short-term cooperative credit structure, operating at the grassroots level and providing credit and other financial services to farmers and rural communities.  This highlights their importance in the rural financial landscape. Statement 3 is correct. DCCBs serve as a vital source of funds for PACS, enabling them to extend credit and other financial services to their members.  This interconnectedness ensures the smooth functioning of the cooperative credit system.



**1. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target set for 2022.
2.  Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices.
3.  Vegetable oil constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural imports, followed by pulses and fruits & vegetables.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's agricultural export policy aimed for a $60 billion export target by 2022, but the actual exports fell short, registering an 8% decline in 2023-24. This highlights challenges in achieving ambitious export goals in the agricultural sector.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice is a significant export, the provided text states that rice constitutes 21% of total exports, with marine products (15%) and spices (9%) following. This indicates that rice is not the largest single export category. Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions vegetable oil as the largest component of agricultural imports (45%), followed by pulses (11%) and fruits & vegetables (8%).  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate reflections of the data presented.


**2. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSP covers a total of 24 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 4 commercial crops.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends the MSP, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.
3.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal procuring agency for all MSP-covered crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the MSP covers 22 crops: 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops (Jute and Copra).  The addition of Toria and de-husked coconut based on other MSPs doesn't change the core number of independently determined MSP crops. Statement 2 is correct. The CACP's recommendation is crucial, but the final authority for MSP fixation lies with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister. This highlights the political and economic significance of MSP decisions. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the FCI is a major procuring agency, it's specifically mentioned as the nodal agency for wheat and paddy, not all MSP-covered crops. Other agencies also play a role in procurement. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the MSP mechanism.


**3. With reference to the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NFSM aims to increase the production of pulses and oilseeds through area expansion and productivity enhancement.
2.  The NFSM is a sub-scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA).
3.  The NFSM's Crop Diversification Programme is primarily focused on the Green Revolution states of Haryana, Punjab, and Western Uttar Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NFSM explicitly aims to boost pulse production through increased acreage and improved yields.  The mention of oilseeds in relation to PM-AASHA doesn't negate the NFSM's primary focus on pulses. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NFSM is a separate initiative, while PM-AASHA has its own price support scheme for oilseeds and pulses.  They are distinct, though potentially complementary, programs. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) exists, it's mentioned as a sub-scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, not directly under the NFSM.  The CDP's focus on the Green Revolution states is accurate, but its linkage to the NFSM is incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the initiatives for promoting agricultural exports in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme adopts a product-specific and country-specific approach to boost exports.
2.  The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) primarily focuses on improving transportation infrastructure within India.
3.  The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) is responsible for registering Geographical Indications (GIs) for Indian products abroad.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MAI Scheme is described as having a focus product-focus country approach, indicating a targeted strategy for specific markets and products. Statement 2 is incorrect. TIES aims to improve export-related infrastructure, including border haats, land custom stations, cold chains, and trade promotion centers, which extends beyond just domestic transportation. Statement 3 is correct. APEDA's role includes promoting exports and handling GI registration for Indian products in international markets, indicating a focus on protecting and promoting Indian agricultural brands globally.  Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**5. With reference to the jute industry in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India accounts for approximately 70% of the estimated world production of jute goods.
2.  The National Jute Board (NJB) is responsible for implementing the Jute I-CARE project, which aims to mechanize jute farming and improve retting processes.
3.  The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging for all commodities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's dominance in jute goods production is clearly stated in the provided text. Statement 2 is correct. The NJB's role in implementing the Jute I-CARE project, focused on mechanization and retting, is accurately described. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act mandates the use of jute packaging for specific commodities, not all. The scope is limited, not universal. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**6. With reference to the  millet production in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India accounts for nearly 80% of Asia's and 20% of the global millet production.
2.  The acreage and production of millets in India have shown a consistent upward trend in recent years.
3.  The relatively shorter shelf life of millets is a significant challenge for storage and marketing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states India's significant share of Asian and global millet production. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text highlights that millet production and acreage have stagnated, not increased, in recent years. This points to challenges in boosting millet cultivation. Statement 3 is correct. The shorter shelf life of millets is identified as a key factor contributing to storage and marketing difficulties. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**7. With reference to the  seaweed farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed farming is a part of aquaculture, and the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% to India's GDP.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025.
3.  The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) has initiated offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that seaweed cultivation falls under aquaculture, and the sector's contribution to GDP. Statement 2 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana's ambitious target for seaweed production is mentioned. Statement 3 is correct. NIOT's involvement in offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region is explicitly stated.  Therefore, all three statements are accurate.


**8. With reference to the  livestock sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India ranks first globally in the average annual productivity of cattle.
2.  Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis are among the significant animal diseases causing economic losses.
3.  The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying has developed the 'Gau Chip' for cattle and the 'Mahish Chip' for buffalo.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that India's average annual cattle productivity is lower than the global average, not higher. Statement 2 is correct. FMD and Brucellosis are explicitly mentioned as causing significant economic losses in the livestock sector. Statement 3 is correct. The development of the 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip' by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is accurately reported. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**9. With reference to the  Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform, consider the following statements:**

1.  ADeX is India's first data exchange platform specifically designed for farmer services.
2.  ADeX primarily holds data on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown.
3.  ADeX utilizes data from the Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations (FASAL) Project.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ADeX is described as India's first data exchange platform for farmer services. Statement 2 is correct. The three primary datasets held by ADeX are accurately listed in the text. Statement 3 is incorrect. While FASAL is mentioned as a separate initiative for agricultural output forecasting, there's no stated direct connection or data sharing with ADeX.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**10.  With reference to the  Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS).
2.  PACS are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
3.  District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly describes the registration and administration of PACS under the Cooperative Societies Act. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that PACS are outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act and are not regulated by the RBI. Statement 3 is correct. The role of DCCBs in providing funds to PACS is accurately mentioned. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**1. With reference to the regulation of Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, granted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) the authority to supersede the boards of UCBs.
2.  UCBs are mandated to achieve a priority sector lending target of 75% by March 2027, and they are permitted to lend money for agricultural purposes.
3.  The RBI permits UCBs to establish a Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) to ensure consistent dividend payments, even during periods of low profitability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, significantly strengthened the RBI's regulatory powers over UCBs, including the authority to supersede their boards if necessary to address governance or financial stability issues. This reflects the RBI's efforts to enhance oversight and improve the overall health of the UCB sector.

Statement 2 is also correct.  UCBs are indeed subject to priority sector lending (PSL) targets, although the exact percentage and deadline might vary slightly.  The inclusion of agricultural lending within their permitted activities is also factual.  The RBI encourages UCBs to focus on lending to priority sectors to promote financial inclusion and support rural development.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that the RBI *asked* UCBs to stop the practice of setting up Dividend Equalisation Funds (DEFs).  Setting up such funds was found to be against existing regulations, as it involved making payments from accumulated profits or reserves—which is not permitted under the current rules.  The RBI's action indicates a move towards stricter adherence to regulatory norms within the UCB sector.


**2. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2024, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  The key areas monitored under the PCA framework include capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.
3.  UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID) are also subject to the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the passage mentions a new PCA framework replacing the SAF, the effective date is stated as April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  Minor inaccuracies in dates or specific details can significantly affect the correctness of a statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly highlights capital, asset quality, and profitability as the key parameters for monitoring under the PCA framework for UCBs.  These are standard metrics used to assess the financial health and stability of banking institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID) from the application of this new PCA framework.  This indicates that those UCBs already have a different, more stringent regulatory approach in place due to their higher risk profile.


**3. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ARCs are financial institutions that acquire NPAs from banks and other financial institutions, primarily to facilitate asset recovery and business revival.
2.  ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.
3.  The establishment of ARCs was initially proposed by the Narasimham Committee I (1991).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ARCs play a crucial role in resolving stressed assets, helping banks clean up their balance sheets and focus on core lending functions.  Their activities include asset recovery and facilitating business revival through loan restructuring.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, to resolve the assets after acquisition.  This timeframe reflects the complexity often involved in resolving NPAs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage attributes the proposal for establishing ARCs to the Narasimham Committee II (1998), not Committee I (1991).  Attributing proposals or recommendations to the wrong committee demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge of financial sector reforms in India.


**4. With reference to Co-lending and Co-origination of loans, consider the following statements:**

1.  Co-lending is an arrangement where a bank and a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) share the credit risk equally on a loan.
2. Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.
3. Co-lending helps increase lending capacity and reduces risk for individual lenders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage specifies that in co-lending, there's a minimum 20% credit risk borne by the NBFC, with the remaining risk falling on the bank.  This is not an equal sharing of risk.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that banks are *not* allowed to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction is designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and ensure sound lending practices.

Statement 3 is correct. Co-lending arrangements are specifically designed to increase the overall lending capacity of the financial system while simultaneously reducing the risk exposure for individual lenders by sharing the burden.


**5. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is published bi-annually by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The FI-Index incorporates data from the banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.
3. The FI-Index uses a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial exclusion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states the FI-Index is published *annually* in July, not bi-annually.  The frequency of publication is a key detail that distinguishes accurate from inaccurate information.

Statement 2 is correct. The FI-Index indeed incorporates data from a wide range of financial sectors, reflecting a comprehensive approach to measuring financial inclusion.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage clarifies that 0 represents complete exclusion, and 100 represents full inclusion—the opposite of what is stated in the question.  Careful attention to the meaning of the index scale is crucial for accurate interpretation.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS was launched in 2022 as part of the Alternate Grievance Redress (AGR) framework of the RBI.
2.  The RB-IOS covers all commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).
3. The RB-IOS aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RB-IOS was launched in 2021, not 2022.  Precise dating of policy initiatives is essential for demonstrating comprehensive knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RB-IOS covers many entities, it does *not* cover *all* NBFCs.  The scheme has specific criteria regarding asset size and whether they accept deposits or have customer interfaces. The passage details the specifics of which NBFCs are included.

Statement 3 is correct. A primary objective of the RB-IOS is to provide a cost-effective mechanism for resolving customer complaints related to banking services, promoting customer satisfaction and fair treatment.


**7. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  One of NUCFDC's major functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs.
3. The need for a UO for India’s UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage specifies that NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  This distinction is crucial in understanding its regulatory classification and operational capacity.

Statement 2 is correct.  Providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs is a key function of NUCFDC.  This support is aimed at improving the financial health and stability of the UCB sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage attributes the initial highlighting of the need for a UO for the UCB sector to the N.S. Viswanathan committee in 2006, with the model being recommended by the V.S. Das committee in 2009.  Confusing the names and timelines of these committees shows a lack of precise understanding of the historical context.


**8. With reference to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All collateral-free loans to individuals/groups belonging to low-income households with an annual income exceeding ₹5,00,000 are treated as microfinance loans.
2.  The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a framework to regulate NBFC-MFIs.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹15 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage specifies that the annual income limit for considering a loan as microfinance is ₹3,00,000, not ₹5,00,000.  This highlights the importance of remembering precise numerical details in policy definitions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Malegam Committee played a significant role in shaping the regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage states that the PMMY's loan limit was enhanced to ₹20 lakh (for Tarun Plus), not ₹15 lakh.  Keeping up-to-date with changes in government schemes is crucial for a complete understanding of relevant policies.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) oversight of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs):**

1.  All NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets exceeding ₹100 crore and engaging in deposit acceptance or customer interface are subject to RBI regulation.
2.  The RBI's oversight extends to all Payment System Participants and Credit Information Companies (CICs), irrespective of their asset size.
3.  The RBI's Ombudsman scheme for resolving customer complaints covers only Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits exceeding ₹50 crore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI's regulatory purview explicitly includes NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) that meet the specified asset size threshold and engage in deposit acceptance or direct customer interaction. This is a crucial aspect of maintaining financial stability and protecting consumers.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI's regulatory reach extends to all Payment System Participants and CICs, regardless of their asset size.  These entities play vital roles in the financial system, and their regulation is essential for ensuring the smooth functioning and security of payments and credit information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the RBI's Integrated Ombudsman Scheme does cover Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, it's not limited to those with deposits exceeding ₹50 crore. The scheme's coverage is broader, encompassing various regulated entities to provide a mechanism for resolving customer complaints efficiently and fairly.  The ₹50 crore threshold is a different criterion applied to other regulatory aspects of these banks.  The question cleverly uses a related but distinct fact to create confusion.


**2. With reference to the RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognising Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure its financial viability and sustainability.
2.  Eligibility criteria for SRO recognition include having adequate net worth, a diversified shareholding structure, and substantial representation of the sector it regulates.
3.  The governance framework of an SRO mandates that at least one-third of its Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must comprise independent members to ensure impartiality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The framework specifically requires SROs to be *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  This reflects the focus on promoting sector-wide compliance and collaboration rather than profit maximization. The question plays on the common misconception that all regulatory bodies are for-profit.

Statement 2 is correct.  The eligibility criteria for SRO recognition indeed emphasize adequate net worth, a diversified shareholder base, and representative sector coverage.  These conditions are designed to ensure the SRO's capacity and impartiality in fulfilling its regulatory role.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The governance framework necessitates at least one-third independent directors, including the Chairperson, to maintain objectivity and prevent conflicts of interest within the SRO's decision-making processes. This is a standard practice in good corporate governance aimed at ensuring accountability.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), primarily focused on providing capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  The establishment of a UO for India's UCB sector was initially suggested by the RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das, and the model was later refined by a working group led by Shri N.S. Viswanathan.
3.  NUCFDC's key functions include providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs, facilitating regulatory compliance, and developing a shared technological platform to enhance efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which is consistent with NUCFDC's role in supporting UCBs. The subtle difference between Type I and Type II NBFCs is designed to be a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The need for a UO was first highlighted by the RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006, and the model was later recommended in 2009 by the working group led by Shri V.S. Das.  The chronology of events is reversed in the statement, a common error in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 3 is correct.  The primary functions of NUCFDC accurately reflect its role in providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs, assisting with regulatory compliance, and creating a shared technological platform for improved operational efficiency.  These are key objectives in strengthening the UCB sector.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):**

1.  The PCA framework, effective from April 1, 2024, aims to enhance the precision and flexibility in addressing the financial health of UCBs.
2.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs except those categorized as tier 1 and those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3.  Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the main parameters used to monitor the financial health of UCBs under the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The effective date of the PCA framework is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  This slight alteration in the date is a classic distractor technique used in UPSC-level questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The PCA framework indeed excludes tier 1 UCBs and those under AID.  The question utilizes the exclusion of tier 1 banks as a distractor, playing on the assumption that all tiers are included.

Statement 3 is correct. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the core parameters for monitoring UCBs' financial health under the PCA framework.  These are standard indicators of a bank's financial soundness.


**5. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 represents complete financial exclusion and 100 represents complete financial inclusion.
2. The FI-Index incorporates data from banking, investment, insurance, and postal sectors, but excludes the pension sector.
3. The FI-Index is published biannually, in January and July, to provide regular updates on the progress of financial inclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FI-Index is indeed a single-value index on a scale of 0 to 100, representing the spectrum of financial inclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index *does* include the pension sector as a key component in assessing overall financial inclusion. The omission of the pension sector is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FI-Index is published annually, not biannually. The change in publication frequency is another common distractor technique.


**6.  With reference to  Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where the import duties on finished goods are higher than the import duties on input goods.
2.  IDS can lead to working capital issues for taxpayers because their resources remain blocked in the form of Input Tax Credit (ITC).
3.  Taxpayers facing IDS will not have Input Tax Credit (ITC) in their GST electronic credit ledger.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDS is characterized by import duties (or, more broadly, GST rates) on input goods being *higher* than those on finished goods, not the other way around.  This reversal of the fact is a common distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  IDS does create working capital problems because the higher tax paid on inputs compared to the output results in a credit balance that is not easily utilized, tying up funds.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Taxpayers facing IDS *will* have an ITC balance in their GST electronic credit ledger, representing the difference between the tax paid on inputs and the tax collected on sales.  The absence of ITC is a key distractor in this statement.


**7. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) and indexation benefits, consider the following statements:**

1. The recent amendment to LTCG tax provisions on immovable properties completely abolishes indexation benefits for all properties, regardless of the acquisition date.
2. The grandfather clause allows properties acquired before July 23rd, 2024, to retain the benefit of indexation, despite the new rules.
3. Indexation benefits reduce the taxable capital gains by adjusting the purchase price for inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendment does not abolish indexation benefits entirely.  A grandfather clause is in place.

Statement 2 is correct. The grandfather clause protects properties acquired before the cutoff date from the elimination of indexation benefits.

Statement 3 is correct. Indexation accounts for inflation, reducing the taxable gain to reflect the real increase in value, not just the nominal increase.  This is a standard feature of capital gains taxation designed to be fair.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:**

1.  Seven CRAs are registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), including Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, INFOMERICS, and Brickwork.
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates all aspects of CRAs' operations in India.
3.  The RBI issues accreditation to CRAs to act as External Credit Assessment Institutions for rating bank loans and facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the listed CRAs are indeed prominent in India,  they are registered with SEBI, not the RBI.  The question uses the names of well-known agencies as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI regulates some aspects, but other regulatory agencies like RBI and IRDA also have jurisdiction over certain aspects of CRAs' operations.  The question implies exclusive SEBI control.

Statement 3 is correct.  The RBI does provide accreditation to CRAs to act as External Credit Assessment Institutions for bank loans. This is a key aspect of the RBI's supervisory functions.


**9. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds that allow investors to participate in infrastructure projects, but they are not recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.
2.  The sponsors of InvITs, typically infrastructure companies, set up the InvITs through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
3.  InvITs generate income through tolls, rents, interest, or dividends from their investments, which are distributed to investors as taxable earnings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  InvIT sponsors are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. This is a crucial detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is incorrect. InvITs are set up through SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), not the RBI. The substitution of SEBI with RBI is a common distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The income generation and distribution mechanism of InvITs is accurately described in this statement.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1. ARCs are financial institutions that purchase Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions, primarily to enhance the profitability of these institutions.
2. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition and redeem the security receipts representing the assets.
3. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) proposed the establishment of ARCs, drawing inspiration from similar asset management companies prevalent globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The primary purpose of ARCs is not to enhance bank profitability but to clean up bank balance sheets by removing NPAs.  Profitability is a secondary effect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5, to resolve assets and redeem security receipts. The shortening of the timeframe is a subtle distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II did indeed recommend the establishment of ARCs, based on international best practices.  This is a well-established fact.


**1. With reference to the regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies and Chit Fund Companies.
2.  Merchant Banker/Venture Capital Fund Companies are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
3.  Nidhi Companies are regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating NBFCs,  it does *not* regulate all types. Housing Finance Companies are primarily regulated by the National Housing Bank (NHB), and Chit Fund Companies fall under the purview of state governments.  The RBI's regulatory oversight primarily focuses on NBFCs that accept deposits or have a customer interface, impacting their financial stability and systemic risk.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI's regulatory mandate includes overseeing entities involved in securities markets, thus encompassing Merchant Bankers and Venture Capital Fund Companies.  Their activities are crucial for maintaining the integrity and transparency of capital markets.

Statement 3 is correct. Nidhi Companies, which operate as mutual benefit societies, are specifically regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the Companies Act. Their regulation focuses on ensuring the financial soundness and ethical operations of these member-based entities.  This distinct regulatory framework underscores the need for specialized oversight tailored to the unique operational characteristics of Nidhi Companies.


**2. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will be implemented from April 1, 2026, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, including those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3. Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability are the key monitoring areas under the PCA framework for UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date of the new PCA framework for UCBs is April 1, 2025, not 2026. This timeline reflects the RBI's commitment to timely implementation of the revised framework to enhance the financial health of UCBs.  The shift from SAF to PCA signifies a more targeted and flexible approach to addressing the financial vulnerabilities of UCBs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework explicitly excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID). This exclusion reflects a tailored approach, recognizing the unique circumstances and challenges faced by UCBs under AID.  The framework's focus is on UCBs in Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 categories, where targeted interventions can be most effective.

Statement 3 is correct. The three pillars—Capital, Asset Quality, and Profitability—form the core of the monitoring process within the PCA framework. These parameters provide a comprehensive assessment of the financial health of UCBs, allowing for timely intervention when necessary. The emphasis on these key areas reflects the RBI's commitment to maintaining the stability of the UCB sector.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs):**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
2. An SRO's governing body must have at least one-third independent directors, including the chairperson.
3.  The RBI's Omnibus Framework mandates that SROs must develop standards for improving compliance culture but not for surveillance methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's framework specifies that an SRO must be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. This requirement ensures that the SRO's primary focus remains on serving the interests of its members and promoting industry best practices rather than maximizing profits.

Statement 2 is correct. The framework mandates that at least one-third of the members of the SRO's board of directors, including the chairperson, must be independent. This provision is crucial for ensuring robust corporate governance and minimizing conflicts of interest within the SRO.  Independent directors bring an objective perspective to the SRO's decision-making processes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI's framework requires SROs to develop standards for both improving compliance culture *and* surveillance methods.  Effective self-regulation necessitates a comprehensive approach that addresses both proactive compliance and robust monitoring mechanisms.  This dual focus is essential for ensuring the effectiveness of SROs in promoting ethical conduct and preventing misconduct within the regulated sector.


**4. With reference to the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The WMA facility is only available to State Governments and not to the Union Government.
2.  Special WMA (now known as Special Drawing Facility) has a higher interest rate than Normal WMA.
3.  Interest rates for WMAs are linked to the repo rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WMA facility is available to both State Governments and the Union Government. This reflects the RBI's role in providing short-term liquidity support to all levels of government to manage temporary cash flow mismatches.  The accessibility of this facility to both levels of government underscores its importance in maintaining smooth government operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Special WMA (now SDF) has a *lower* interest rate than Normal WMA. This differential reflects the RBI's intention to provide more concessional financing during periods of acute liquidity needs.  The lower interest rate on SDF serves as an incentive for states to utilize this facility when facing severe cash flow challenges.

Statement 3 is correct.  Interest rates for WMAs are indeed linked to the repo rate. This linkage reflects the RBI's monetary policy framework and ensures that the cost of WMA financing aligns with the overall stance of monetary policy.  This ensures consistency between the cost of short-term government borrowing and the broader monetary policy environment.


**5.  With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All seven CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2.  SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs must disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy.
3.  The RBI is the sole regulatory authority for all aspects of CRAs' operations in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seven CRAs are registered with SEBI,  *not all* are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.  Brickwork Ratings is an example of a CRA registered with SEBI that is not RBI-accredited.  This highlights the nuanced regulatory landscape for CRAs in India, with multiple agencies overseeing different aspects of their operations.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulations require CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines on conflict of interest. This transparency is crucial for ensuring the credibility and reliability of credit ratings, which are widely used by investors and other stakeholders.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RBI is *not* the sole regulatory authority for all aspects of CRAs' operations. SEBI also plays a significant regulatory role, particularly concerning the disclosure and transparency aspects of credit rating practices.  The shared regulatory responsibility reflects the complex nature of the CRA industry and the need for multiple perspectives in overseeing its operations.  IRDA and PFRDA also have regulatory roles concerning specific aspects of CRA activities.


**1. With reference to the GST Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Constitution, introduced through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016.
2.  Decisions within the GST Council require a three-fourths majority of the weighted votes, with states collectively holding a two-thirds voting weight and the Centre holding one-third.
3. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a first appellate authority established under the Central GST (CGST) Act, 2017, to hear appeals against orders passed by the Assessing Officer under CGST Act, 2017 and State GST Acts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council's constitutional status is clearly established under Article 279A, introduced by the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act.  Statement 2 is also correct. The weighted voting system ensures that states have a significant voice in GST-related decisions.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a *second* appellate authority, not a first appellate authority. Appeals first go to the Appellate Authority under the CGST Act before reaching the Tribunal.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**2. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for all policy-level matters concerning PPPs, including project implementation and monitoring.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects, while central sector projects are overseen by a separate committee under the Ministry of Finance.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit plays a crucial role, it's not solely responsible for *all* policy-level matters concerning PPPs. Other ministries and departments also have involvement in PPP project implementation and monitoring. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  State-level projects may have their own evaluation mechanisms.  Statement 3 is correct; the NMP's objective and target are accurately described. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on finished goods is higher than the GST rate on the inputs used in their production.
2.  IDS negatively impacts domestic industries by making products more expensive and hindering their competitiveness in the export market.
3.  Taxpayers facing an IDS will always have a zero Input Tax Credit (ITC) balance in their GST electronic credit ledger because the output tax liability exceeds the input tax credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IDS is defined by import duties or GST rates on input goods being *higher* than on finished goods, not the other way around. Statement 2 is correct.  The higher cost of inputs due to IDS increases the final product price, reducing competitiveness. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While taxpayers facing IDS *do* have ITC, it's not necessarily a zero balance. They will have a positive ITC balance because their input tax paid is more than their output tax liability, leading to refund-related issues.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes aspects of the IDS.


**4. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) and indexation benefit, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendment abolishing indexation benefits for LTCG on immovable properties applies retrospectively to all properties acquired before and after July 23, 2024.
2. The grandfather clause allows properties purchased before July 23, 2024, to retain the benefit of indexation, despite the new rules for future acquisitions.
3.  Indexation benefits reduce the taxable capital gains by adjusting for inflation, effectively lowering the tax burden on long-term investments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The abolishment of indexation benefits is *not* retrospective; it applies only to properties acquired *after* July 23, 2024. Statement 2 is correct. The grandfather clause protects those who acquired properties before the cut-off date. Statement 3 is also correct; indexation adjusts for inflation, lowering the tax burden. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**5. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The IBC aims to promote a resolution process for distressed businesses, improve recovery rates for creditors, and provide an exit mechanism for companies facing financial distress within 90 days.
2.  Insolvency Professionals (IPs) are appointed to manage the insolvency resolution process, and they are regulated by Insolvency Professional Agencies (IPAs).
3.  The Adjudicating Authorities under the IBC are the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for corporate insolvencies and the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) for individual or partnership insolvencies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IBC aims to achieve those objectives, the mandated timeframe for CIRP is 180 days, extendable to 330 days, not 90 days. Statement 2 is correct; IPs and their regulation by IPAs are central to the IBC. Statement 3 is also correct; NCLT and DRT serve as adjudicating authorities under the IBC.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**6. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are financial institutions that primarily buy Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions to improve the financial health of borrowers.
2.  ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition of financial assets and redeem the security receipts representing the assets.
3. The genesis of ARCs in India can be traced back to the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee – II (1998).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs buy NPAs to clean up banks' balance sheets, not necessarily to improve borrowers' financial health; the focus is on asset recovery for the banks. Statement 2 is incorrect. ARCs have a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, to resolve assets and redeem security receipts. Statement 3 is correct; the Narasimham Committee II did recommend the establishment of ARCs.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**7. With reference to Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) and the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will be effective from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  The new PCA framework applies to all UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
3.  The key areas monitored under the PCA framework for UCBs are capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability, but not liquidity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The effective date of the new PCA framework is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024. Statement 2 is correct; the application of the PCA framework is accurately described. Statement 3 is incorrect. Liquidity is also a key area monitored under the PCA framework, along with capital, asset quality, and profitability. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  NUCFDC will operate as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the urban cooperative bank sector.
3. The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(b) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Statement 2 is correct; NUCFDC's role as an SRO is accurate. Statement 3 is incorrect. The need was first highlighted by the N.S. Viswanathan committee in 2006; the V.S. Das committee's recommendation came later in 2009. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to the Monetary Policy of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI determines the inflation target in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) every five years in consultation with the Central Government.
2.  The current monetary policy framework in India adopts a flexible inflation targeting approach, with the current target of 4% (±2%) CPI inflation until March 2027.
3.  Expansionary monetary policy involves the central bank lowering interest rates, making borrowing cheaper, while contractionary policy involves raising interest rates, making borrowing more expensive.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Central Government, in consultation with the RBI, determines the inflation target, not the MPC itself. The MPC implements monetary policy to achieve the target. Statement 2 is incorrect. The current target is until March 2026, not March 2027. Statement 3 is correct; the descriptions of expansionary and contractionary monetary policies are accurate.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**10. With reference to the Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999, and UNESCO recognition, consider the following statements:**

1. The GI Act, 1999, guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge related to specific products.
2. UNESCO recognizes Yoga and other traditional practices as Intangible Cultural Heritage, providing them with international protection under the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP is explicitly built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (the Government of India's cloud), and integrates data from the Survey of India. This emphasis on open-source and government infrastructure ensures transparency and accessibility.  The use of open-source technology also reduces reliance on proprietary software and promotes collaboration.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate ₹8.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) by monetising existing government assets.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
3. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's target is ₹6.0 lakh crore, not ₹8.0 lakh crore, over the specified four-year period.  This discrepancy highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding government initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects, not solely state-level ones.  The distinction between central and state-level projects is crucial for understanding the scope and jurisdiction of the committee.

Statement 3 is correct. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs holds the responsibility for policy-level decisions related to PPPs in India.  This demonstrates the central government's role in shaping the framework for PPPs.


**3. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to encourage harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of the world's fish stocks.
2.  Developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) were granted a transition period of 5 years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement under Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT).
3.  The agreement has already been accepted by two-thirds of WTO members and is currently in effect.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The agreement's explicit aim is to *curb* harmful subsidies, not encourage them.  This is a fundamental aspect of the agreement's objective to protect global fish stocks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The transition period granted to developing countries and LDCs under S&DT is 2 years, not 5 years.  This detail underscores the need for precise knowledge of the agreement's provisions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The agreement requires acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members to come into effect, and as of December 2024, it is still short of the required number of ratifications.  This highlights the ongoing challenges in achieving international consensus on fisheries management.


**4. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement was negotiated during the Doha Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2. The agreement sets out minimum standards of protection for intellectual property rights (IPR), encompassing inventions, literary and artistic works, and designs.

2.  Geological Survey of India has delineated resources of polymetallic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts primarily in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.
3. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024 apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Offshore mining in India is defined as the extraction of mineral deposits from the seabed at depths *exceeding 200 meters*, not 100 meters. This difference in depth significantly impacts the technical challenges and costs associated with offshore mining operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Geological Survey of India has delineated resources of polymetallic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not primarily in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea.  The specific location of these resources is crucial for understanding the geographical distribution of India's offshore mineral wealth.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly *exclude* mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  This exclusion highlights the specific focus of the rules on certain types of offshore mineral resources.


**6.  With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) within the WTO, consider the following statements:**

2.  Tariffication, under the AoA's Market Access pillar, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.
3.  The "peace clause" under the AoA provides a permanent solution to the issue of Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AoA was negotiated during the Uruguay Round, not the Tokyo Round, of GATT negotiations. This detail is crucial for understanding the historical context of the agreement within the evolution of the WTO.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AoA's Market Access pillar does indeed require tariffication—the conversion of non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs. This is a key element in promoting market transparency and reducing trade distortions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The "peace clause" agreed upon at the WTO's 9th Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali serves as an *interim*, not a permanent, solution to the issue of PSH for food security.  The distinction between interim and permanent solutions is critical for understanding the ongoing negotiations surrounding PSH.


**7. With reference to the Internationalization of the Indian Rupee (INR), consider the following statements:**

1. The INR is fully convertible in both the current and capital accounts.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has enabled INR trade settlement with only 10 countries through Special Vostro Rupee Accounts (SVRAs).
3.  The inclusion of INR in Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) enhances the efficiency and reduces the risk in international transactions involving the INR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INR is fully convertible in the current account but only partially convertible in the capital account.  The distinction between current and capital account convertibility is crucial for understanding the limitations on the international use of the INR.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI has facilitated INR trade settlement with *22* countries, not just 10, through SVRAs. This demonstrates the expanding scope of the INR's use in international trade.

Statement 3 is correct. The inclusion of the INR in CLS does indeed improve the efficiency and reduce the risks associated with international transactions involving the Indian Rupee. CLS is a vital system for settling foreign currency transactions.


**8. With reference to the IMF's lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF primarily provides financial support for specific projects, unlike development banks.
2. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) offers non-concessional financial support at market-based interest rates.
3. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) provides longer-term financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IMF, unlike development banks, does *not* typically lend for specific projects; it provides financial support to countries facing crises.  This difference in lending approach is fundamental to understanding the roles of the IMF and development banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PRGT provides *concessional* financial support, often at zero interest rates, tailored to the needs of low-income countries.  The concessional nature of the PRGT's lending is a crucial aspect of its design to assist the most vulnerable nations.

Statement 3 is correct. The RST indeed offers longer-term financing at affordable interest rates to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries aiming to build resilience against external shocks.  The RST's focus on longer-term financing is a key feature differentiating it from other IMF lending instruments.


**9. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

2. The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and experts from across WBG institutions at the International Finance Corporation (IFC).
3. The World Bank provides guarantees primarily for small-scale projects with low political and sovereign risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP aims to *increase*, not reduce, the WBG's annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030.  This ambitious goal reflects the platform's objective to expand the World Bank's role in supporting private sector development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and experts at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), not the International Finance Corporation (IFC).  This distinction highlights the specific role of MIGA within the World Bank Group.

2.  Crowding out is more likely to occur when the economy is operating at or near its full employment capacity, as increased government demand for resources competes directly with private sector demand.
3.  Crowding out is always a negative phenomenon, resulting in reduced economic growth and hindering private sector investment regardless of the economic context.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the concept of crowding out. The mechanism of increased government spending leading to higher interest rates and reduced private investment is central to the crowding-out effect. Statement 2 correctly identifies the economic context where crowding out is most likely to occur.  When the economy is near full employment, resources are scarce, and increased government demand directly competes with the private sector, leading to a more pronounced crowding-out effect.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While crowding out can have negative consequences, it's not always detrimental. In some cases, government spending can stimulate economic activity and offset the negative effects of crowding out, especially if it's targeted at productive investments.  The impact of crowding out depends on various factors, including the type of government spending and the overall state of the economy.  It's not universally negative.

2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only central sector PPP projects, excluding state-level initiatives.
3. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) through the monetization of existing government assets, primarily focusing on brownfield infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in setting the policy framework for PPPs. However, the operational aspects and implementation of specific projects often fall under the purview of the respective ministries involved.  The statement's implication that operational aspects are *exclusively* handled by individual ministries is an oversimplification.  The overall policy direction and guidelines, however, originate from the Department of Economic Affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee does evaluate central sector PPP projects, its mandate isn't limited to these.  The statement incorrectly excludes state-level initiatives from the committee's purview.  Many state governments also utilize PPP models and have their own appraisal mechanisms, but the central committee may still offer guidance or review in some cases.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) by monetizing existing government assets.  The focus is predominantly on brownfield infrastructure, which represents existing assets that are being repurposed or leveraged for revenue generation. This is a key strategy to improve infrastructure financing and reduce the government's fiscal burden.


**2. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID was established under the Companies Act, 2013, and functions as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) with less than 51% of its paid-up share capital held by the central government.
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to facilitate short-term, recourse-based infrastructure financing, focusing on quick-return projects.
3. NaBFID's establishment as a Development Financial Institution (DFI) under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, marks a significant shift toward long-term infrastructure financing in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID was indeed notified as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013. However, the statement incorrectly states it holds *less* than 51% of its paid-up share capital from the central government. To be classified as a PFI, at least 51% of its paid-up share capital must be held by the central or state government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's core mandate is to support *long-term*, non-recourse infrastructure financing, not short-term, recourse-based financing. The focus is on projects with longer gestation periods and potentially higher risk profiles, which require patient capital and a different risk management approach.

Statement 3 is correct. NaBFID's establishment under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, signifies a crucial shift towards promoting long-term, sustainable infrastructure financing in India.  This addresses a critical gap in the market, where long-term capital for large-scale infrastructure projects has often been scarce.

2.  Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches, while safer than older Integral Coach Factory (ICF) coaches, are not yet universally deployed across all Indian railway lines due to high procurement costs.
3.  The Kavach system, an indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, is designed for high-speed operations only and is not effective in foggy weather conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RRSK is indeed a fund for upgrading railway safety infrastructure, but the amount is ₹1 lakh crore, not ₹50,000 crore, and it's a 5-year, not 10-year, plan.  This incorrect figure and timeframe are designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct.  LHB coaches are demonstrably safer than ICF coaches, a fact widely acknowledged. However, their complete deployment across all lines is gradual, hampered by the significant investment required for their procurement and integration into the existing system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kavach system is designed to enhance safety across various operational conditions, including high speeds and foggy weather.  Its functionality isn't limited to high-speed scenarios only; it's intended to improve safety under a range of circumstances.  This is a crucial distinction to catch.


**4. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first proposed asset monetization in 2010, which was subsequently implemented through the National Monetization Pipeline (NMP) in the Union Budget 2021-22.
2. Asset monetization involves only the outright sale of government-owned assets to private entities, without any lease or license options.
3. The top five sectors identified for monetization under the NMP account for approximately 75% of the total pipeline value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation for asset monetization was made in 2012, not 2010. The NMP was indeed announced in the Union Budget 2021-22, but the timeline is slightly off in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Asset monetization encompasses a broader range of approaches than just outright sales.  It includes leasing, licensing, and other forms of revenue-generating arrangements that allow the government to utilize its assets more effectively without necessarily transferring ownership.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The top five sectors under the NMP account for approximately 83%, not 75%, of the aggregate pipeline value.  This subtle difference in percentage aims to test the candidate's precise recall of figures.  The slight variation is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions.
