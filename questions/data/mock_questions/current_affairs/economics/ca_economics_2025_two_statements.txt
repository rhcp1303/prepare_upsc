Statement 2 is incorrect.  Under RELOS, access to logistics and support facilities is available during both wartime and peacetime missions. This allows for greater interoperability and logistical support during various operations.  The agreement's scope encompasses a broader range of scenarios beyond just wartime contingencies.


**9. With reference to India's dairy sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Flood was implemented in a single phase, spearheaded by Dr. Verghese Kurien.
2. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission focuses solely on increasing milk production without considering breed conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Flood was implemented in three phases, not a single phase.  This phased approach was crucial for its success in transforming India's dairy sector. Dr. Verghese Kurien played a pivotal role in leading this initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to both increase milk production and conserve indigenous bovine breeds.  Breed conservation is a key component of the mission, ensuring the preservation of genetic diversity and the sustainability of the dairy sector.


**10. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. AIF provides short-term debt financing for agricultural projects.
2.  AIF offers interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage exclusively for loans exceeding ₹2 Crores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AIF provides medium-to-long-term debt financing, not short-term financing.  The aim is to support sustainable investments in agricultural infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AIF offers interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage for loans up to ₹2 Crores.  Loans exceeding this amount may not receive the same level of support.  The support is designed to incentivize investment in agricultural infrastructure, particularly for smaller projects.


**11. With reference to the KISAN initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics for improving crop yield estimation but doesn't integrate ground-level data.
2. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a data exchange platform that primarily focuses on weather forecasting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) uses space technology and geoinformatics to improve crop yield estimation, and it does integrate ground-level data alongside remotely sensed data for more accurate assessments. Combining both sources enhances the reliability of yield predictions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) is a data exchange platform that primarily focuses on providing crucial datasets related to farmers, including farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crop-sown data.  While weather information may be integrated, it's not the primary focus of ADeX.


**12. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure accurate price determination.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP without any government oversight.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MSP is announced at the beginning of the sowing season, not at the end of the harvesting season. This allows farmers to make informed decisions about their cropping patterns based on the assured minimum price.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs based on its analysis of production costs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. The CCEA considers various factors, including the CACP's recommendations, before finalizing the MSPs.


**13. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's agricultural exports consistently exceed the ambitious targets set by the government.
2. The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was primarily due to increased domestic consumption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's agricultural exports did not consistently exceed the ambitious targets set by the government.  In 2023-24, there was a decline in agricultural exports, falling short of the target set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.  Various factors contribute to this shortfall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While increased domestic consumption may play a role, the decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was likely due to a combination of factors, including global market conditions, reduced production of certain crops, and logistical challenges.  Attributing the decline solely to increased domestic consumption would be an oversimplification.


**14. With reference to the RBI's actions concerning cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI has recently introduced relaxed NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks.
2. The RBI has mandated that cooperative banks must allocate net profits to the Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) before complying with IRACP norms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI has revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks, introducing changes to the Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms.  These revisions aim to improve risk management and financial stability within the cooperative banking sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Cooperative banks must comply with IRACP norms and other regulations *before* allocating net profits to the Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR).  The order of these actions is crucial for accurate financial reporting and compliance.


**15. With reference to co-lending in the Indian financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Co-lending arrangements are limited to loans for the agriculture sector.
2. Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Co-lending arrangements are not limited to the agriculture sector. They extend to priority sectors, allowing banks and NBFCs to collaborate in providing loans to various sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Banks are not allowed to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction aims to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of lending practices.


**16. With reference to wilful defaulters in the Indian banking system, consider the following statements:**

1. The definition of a wilful defaulter only includes individuals, excluding entities like companies.
2. The RBI's directions on wilful defaulters apply only to public sector banks and exclude private sector banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition of a wilful defaulter includes both individuals and entities like companies.  The criteria apply broadly to any borrower who intentionally defaults on loan repayments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's directions on wilful defaulters apply to all banks, including both public sector and private sector banks. The regulations aim to ensure consistent treatment of wilful defaulters across the banking system.


**17. With reference to India's innovation performance, consider the following statements:**

1. India's ranking in the Global Innovation Index (GII) is identical to its ranking in the Innovation Policy Index (IPI).
2. The Innovation Policy Index (IPI) assesses the innovation performance of a broader range of economies compared to the Global Innovation Index (GII).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's ranking in the Global Innovation Index (GII) and the Innovation Policy Index (IPI) are not identical.  The indices use different methodologies and criteria, leading to variations in rankings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Global Innovation Index (GII) assesses the innovation performance of a broader range of economies compared to the Innovation Policy Index (IPI). The GII includes a larger number of countries in its assessment.


**18. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty is exclusively focused on protecting intellectual property rights and excludes considerations of traditional knowledge.
2. The treaty's implementation requires ratification by all member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty specifically addresses the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK).  It aims to prevent the misappropriation of traditional knowledge and ensure fair and equitable benefit-sharing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The treaty's implementation requires ratification by 15 parties, not all WIPO member states. Once 15 parties have ratified it, the treaty will come into force three months later. This allows for a more manageable and efficient implementation process.


**19. With reference to measures taken by the Indian government to protect traditional knowledge and genetic resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is primarily designed to facilitate the commercialization of traditional knowledge.
2. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, negates the concept of community rights over forest resources.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) is designed to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents on traditional knowledge, not to facilitate its commercialization.  Its main purpose is to protect India's intellectual heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, specifically recognizes and provides for community rights over forest resources and traditional practices.  It aims to empower local communities and ensure their participation in the management of forest resources.


**20. With reference to initiatives to promote pulses cultivation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) focuses solely on increasing the productivity of pulses without considering area expansion.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) does not include pulses under its price support scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) aims to increase pulses production through both area expansion and productivity enhancement.  A comprehensive approach is necessary to achieve significant increases in pulses output.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) includes oilseeds and pulses under its price support scheme.  This provides price support to farmers, mitigating the risk of distress selling.


**21. With reference to the jute industry in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the second-largest producer of jute goods globally, accounting for about 30% of estimated world production.
2. The National Jute Development Programme is solely focused on promoting the export of jute products.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is the leading producer of jute goods globally, accounting for about 70% of estimated world production, not 30%.  Its dominance in the jute sector is significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Jute Development Programme aims to improve the overall development of the jute industry, including cultivation, manufacturing, and marketing, not solely focusing on exports.  While export promotion is a component, domestic market development is also a key aspect of the programme.


**22. With reference to the promotion of millets in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Millets are nutritionally inferior to other grains and lack significant health benefits.
2. The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Millet-based products (PLISMBP) is primarily aimed at discouraging millet cultivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Millets are nutritionally rich and offer several health benefits. They are a good source of various nutrients and are associated with several health benefits, including combating anaemia, cardiovascular disease, and lowering cholesterol levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Millet-based products (PLISMBP) is designed to promote millet cultivation and processing, not to discourage it.  The scheme aims to enhance the competitiveness of millet-based products in the market.


**23. With reference to the SPICED scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The SPICED scheme focuses exclusively on increasing the production of cardamom.
2.  The SPICED scheme's implementation is limited to a single financial year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increasing cardamom production is a key objective of the SPICED (Sustainability in spice sector through Progressive, Innovative and Collaborative interventions for Export Development) scheme, it also encompasses broader goals, including export promotion, capacity building, and skill development across the spice sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SPICED scheme's implementation spans the remaining term of the 15th Finance Commission (from 2023-24 to 2025-26), covering multiple financial years.  This longer timeframe is essential for achieving the scheme's long-term objectives.



**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All UCBs, irrespective of their tier categorization, are mandated to open new branches only with prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the UCB sector, aiming to enhance regulatory compliance and provide liquidity support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that *some* UCBs are allowed to open new branches up to a certain percentage without prior RBI approval. This is an exception, not a universal rule. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the branching regulations for UCBs.  The RBI's approach to branch expansion for UCBs demonstrates a nuanced regulatory strategy, balancing the need for oversight with allowing for flexibility based on the bank's size and performance.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly identifies NUCFDC as an umbrella organization registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, operating as an SRO for the UCB sector. Its functions include regulatory compliance assistance, capital raising, and liquidity support, aligning precisely with the statement's description. The establishment of NUCFDC highlights the RBI's efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework for UCBs and improve their financial stability.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs regardless of their tier classification, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  The key parameters monitored under the PCA framework for UCBs are capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability, with intervention triggered only when thresholds in all three parameters are breached simultaneously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the new PCA framework *excludes* UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). This detail is crucial and demonstrates a targeted approach to regulation, tailoring the framework's application based on the specific circumstances of individual banks. The statement fails to account for this exception, leading to an inaccurate generalization.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly indicates that capital, asset quality, and profitability are the key areas for monitoring under the PCA framework. While the passage doesn't explicitly state that all three must be breached simultaneously to trigger intervention, the focus on these parameters aligns with the statement's core message. The emphasis on these three factors reflects a risk-based approach, prioritizing the most critical aspects of a bank's financial health.


**3. With reference to the Variable Rate Repo (VRR) mechanism employed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The VRR rate is always lower than the Repo Rate and higher than the Reverse Repo Rate, acting as a tool to inject short-term liquidity into the banking system only when market interest rates are significantly higher than the Repo Rate.
2.  The RBI utilizes the Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) mechanism to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system, with the VRRR rate typically being determined by market forces and generally lower than the Reverse Repo Rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the VRR rate is generally lower than the Repo Rate, the text doesn't state that it's *always* higher than the Reverse Repo Rate.  The condition that it only injects liquidity when market rates are significantly higher than the Repo Rate is also an oversimplification. The VRR is a flexible tool used to manage liquidity in various market conditions. The statement's rigid conditions misrepresent the dynamic nature of VRR operations.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the VRRR as a mechanism to absorb excess liquidity and notes that its rate is market-determined.  The statement's description aligns with the text's explanation of VRRR's role in managing liquidity within the banking system. The mention of market forces reflects the RBI's approach to using market-based instruments to maintain monetary stability.


**4. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates PSL targets that are uniform across all types of banks in India, ensuring equitable distribution of credit across vulnerable sectors.
2. PSL guidelines promote inclusive development by directing funds to sectors such as agriculture, MSMEs, education, and housing, and the PSL target for scheduled commercial banks is lower than that for Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that PSL targets are *not* the same for all types of banks.  This reflects the RBI's differentiated approach to regulation, acknowledging the varying capacities and operational contexts of different banking institutions. The statement ignores this crucial detail, creating a misleading generalization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While PSL does promote inclusive development by focusing on the mentioned sectors, the passage states that the PSL target for scheduled commercial banks is *higher* than that for RRBs.  This reflects the larger capacity and reach of scheduled commercial banks.  The statement reverses this key factual element, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the relative PSL targets.


**5.  With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS, established under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, solely addresses customer grievances related to services provided by commercial banks and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs).
2.  The RBI Ombudsman Scheme's redressal mechanism operates through a centralized system, with all complaints processed through the Centralized Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC) before being assigned to the relevant RBI Ombudsman office.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly indicates that the RB-IOS covers a wider range of regulated entities than just commercial banks and RRBs. It includes Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (above a certain deposit size), and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) meeting specific criteria. The statement's limited scope misrepresents the scheme's comprehensive coverage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the passage mentions a Centralized Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC), it doesn't state that *all* complaints are processed exclusively through this center before assignment to an Ombudsman office.  The description of the redressal mechanism is incomplete and potentially misleading.  The actual process may involve multiple stages and points of contact before final assignment.


**6. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and related regulatory measures in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account *before* allocating net profits to BDDR.
2. The co-lending model, where banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) jointly provide loans, allows banks to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group, provided the minimum 20% credit risk is borne by the NBFC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that under the revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks, provisions for BDDR must be charged as an expense *before* any net profit allocation to BDDR. This reflects a stricter approach to managing NPA risks within cooperative banks.  The statement accurately reflects this specific regulatory requirement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly prohibits banks from entering into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction aims to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and enhance the integrity of the co-lending model. The statement contradicts this crucial regulatory provision.


**7. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all 22 crops, including Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops, based on A2+FL cost, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) simply ratifies the CACP's recommendations.
2.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) acts as the nodal procuring agency for all 22 crops covered under the MSP scheme, ensuring that farmers receive the minimum guaranteed price for their produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs, the passage indicates that the final decision rests with the CCEA chaired by the Prime Minister, not just a ratification. The statement oversimplifies the decision-making process, omitting the crucial role of the CCEA.  The statement also incorrectly states that only A2+FL cost is considered, ignoring the other cost considerations mentioned in the text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage specifies that FCI is the nodal agency for wheat and paddy only, not all 22 crops. The statement incorrectly generalizes FCI's role to encompass all MSP-covered crops. This demonstrates a lack of precision regarding the procurement responsibilities under the MSP scheme.



**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s surplus and its transfer to the government, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of the RBI's entire net interest income to the central government.
2. The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee, suggests transferring any surplus above a maintained realized equity of 5.5% to 6.5% of the balance sheet to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Act, 1934, under Section 47, mandates the transfer of the RBI's *profits* to the central government, not its entire net interest income.  A significant portion of the RBI's income is used for its operational expenses and reserves before profit calculation. The statement misrepresents the extent of the mandated transfer.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bimal Jalan Committee's Economic Capital Framework (ECF) indeed recommends a mechanism for surplus transfer to the government.  The ECF specifies that the RBI should maintain a realized equity between 5.5% and 6.5% of its balance sheet. Any amount exceeding this threshold is considered surplus and recommended for transfer.  The committee also considered the Currency and Gold Revaluation Account (CGRA) and set a threshold for that as well.  The statement accurately reflects this key aspect of the ECF.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to Ways and Means Advances (WMA) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ways and Means Advances are exclusively provided to State Governments and Union Territories by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to bridge temporary cash flow gaps.
2.  Special Ways and Means Advances (now termed Special Drawing Facility - SDF) carry a higher interest rate compared to Normal WMAs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While WMAs are primarily used by State Governments and Union Territories, this facility is also available to the Union Government. The statement incorrectly restricts the availability of WMAs to only sub-national governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The interest rate on Special WMAs (now SDF) is *lower* than that of Normal WMAs.  The statement reverses the relationship between the interest rates of the two types of advances.  Both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the scope and interest rate structure of WMAs and SDFs.


**3. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first proposed Asset Monetization in 2012, which was subsequently implemented through the National Monetization Pipeline (NMP) announced in the Union Budget 2021-22.
2. Asset Monetization primarily involves the outright sale of government-owned assets to private entities to generate revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijay Kelkar Committee did indeed recommend asset monetization in 2012, and this recommendation was a precursor to the NMP, which was launched in the Union Budget 2021-22. The statement correctly links the committee's recommendation to the subsequent policy initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Asset Monetization does not always involve the outright sale of assets.  It more commonly involves long-term leases or licensing agreements, where the government retains some ownership while generating revenue streams from the asset's utilization. The statement incorrectly simplifies the process, omitting the crucial aspect of long-term arrangements and risk-sharing.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Cooperative Database (NCD):**

1. The NCD was inaugurated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare to provide comprehensive information on the cooperative sector in India.
2.  The NCD is a centralized platform that exclusively focuses on the financial data of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCD was inaugurated by the Ministry of Cooperation, not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  The statement incorrectly attributes the database's launch to the wrong ministry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCD includes data on PACS, it is not limited to only their financial data.  It provides a much broader overview of the entire cooperative sector in India, encompassing various types of cooperative societies and their activities. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the NCD's coverage.


**5. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The PSL framework aims to ensure credit flow to only agricultural and rural sectors to promote inclusive growth.
2.  The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework for districts with lower credit flow, providing higher weightage to fresh priority sector loans in such areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PSL prioritizes agricultural and rural sectors, its scope is broader, encompassing other sectors deemed crucial for national development, such as MSMEs, education, and housing. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of PSL to only agricultural and rural sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. The revised PSL norms indeed incorporate an incentive mechanism to improve credit flow to underserved districts.  Higher weightage is assigned to fresh PSL loans in districts with low credit availability, encouraging banks to lend in these areas. The statement accurately reflects this key feature of the revised framework.


**6. With reference to the Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio of banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A high CD ratio always indicates efficient resource utilization by banks and robust economic growth.
2.  According to the RBI's Financial Stability Report, the CD ratio peaked at 78.8% in December 2023, with a majority of banks exceeding 75% being public sector banks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a high CD ratio might suggest significant lending activity, it does not automatically imply efficient resource utilization or robust economic growth.  A high CD ratio could also signal excessive risk-taking by banks or a mismatch between credit supply and demand.  The statement presents an oversimplified and potentially misleading interpretation of the CD ratio.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's Financial Stability Report indicated that over 75% of banks with CD ratios above 75% were *private* sector banks, not public sector banks. The statement incorrectly identifies the dominant type of bank exceeding the 75% threshold.


**7. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Non-Performing Asset (NPA) is a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 180 days.
2. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) is chaired by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An NPA is defined as a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days. The statement misstates the crucial timeframe for NPA classification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FSDC is chaired by the Finance Minister of India, not the Governor of the RBI.  The statement incorrectly identifies the chairperson of this crucial financial stability body.


**8. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  A key function of NUCFDC is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs, including raising capital and offering fund management services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NUCFDC acts as an SRO for UCBs, it is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. The statement misidentifies the regulatory authority overseeing NUCFDC.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary function of NUCFDC is indeed to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs, including raising capital and offering fund management and consultancy services. The statement accurately reflects this core function of the organization.


**9. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will be effective from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, regardless of their tier classification or whether they are under All Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework for UCBs is effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024. The statement contains an error in the effective date of the framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework does *not* apply to all UCBs. It specifically excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The statement incorrectly claims universal applicability of the framework.  The statement also incorrectly omits the exception of UCBs under AID.


**10.  With reference to the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR), consider the following statements:**

1. MIBOR is a benchmark interest rate used for overnight lending and borrowing between banks in Mumbai.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently recommended replacing MIBOR with a new, unsecured money market benchmark.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MIBOR is not solely used for overnight lending. It's a benchmark rate for various maturities, not just overnight transactions.  The statement incorrectly limits MIBOR's application to only overnight transactions.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI has indeed recommended a transition from MIBOR to a new secured money market benchmark rate. The statement accurately reflects the RBI's recent policy recommendation.  The statement also correctly mentions that the new benchmark would be secured.


**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) is a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs, registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, applies to all UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NUCFDC acts as an umbrella organization for UCBs, registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, signifying its role as an SRO.  Its functions include liquidity and capital support, regulatory compliance assistance, and the development of a shared technology platform.  The description accurately reflects NUCFDC's structure and mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, explicitly *excludes* UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). This crucial detail makes the statement factually inaccurate.  The PCA framework aims to improve the financial health of UCBs with greater precision and flexibility, but its application is carefully defined to exclude certain categories of banks. The exclusion of AID-designated banks is a key element of the framework's design.


**2. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revised PSL norms introduce an incentive framework, providing a 125% weight to fresh priority sector loans in districts with loan availability exceeding Rs. 9,000 per person, starting from FY25.
2.  PSL Certificates (PSLCs), tradable instruments issued against priority sector loans, aim to help banks meet their PSL targets by enabling the purchase of these certificates in case of shortfalls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised PSL norms provide a *higher* weight (125%) to fresh priority sector loans in districts with *lower* credit flow (less than Rs 9,000 per person), not exceeding it. This is a crucial distinction; the statement misrepresents the incentive mechanism's objective, which is to encourage lending in underserved areas.  The disincentive framework, conversely, applies to districts with high loan availability (more than Rs 42,000 per person).

Statement 2 is correct. PSLCs are indeed tradable certificates issued against priority sector loans. Their purpose is to allow banks to fulfill their PSL targets even if they fall short of lending directly to priority sectors. This mechanism promotes efficient allocation of credit resources within the banking system.  This is a key feature of the PSL framework aimed at achieving the policy's goals.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) measures the extent of financial inclusion across the country using three parameters: Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%), published annually in July.
2. The Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS) covers all commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, regardless of their deposit size, for resolving customer grievances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FI-Index is a comprehensive measure of financial inclusion, incorporating banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.  The weighting of the three parameters (Access, Usage, and Quality) and the annual July publication are accurate details.  The index provides a single value (0-100) reflecting the overall level of financial inclusion in the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RB-IOS does cover many of the entities mentioned, it specifically excludes Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits below ₹50 crore.  The statement's claim of universal coverage across all mentioned banks, regardless of deposit size, is therefore inaccurate.  The RB-IOS is designed to provide a cost-free redressal mechanism for customer complaints, but its scope is limited by certain criteria, including minimum asset or deposit sizes for some entities.


**4. With reference to India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India’s cloud), and integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) by monetising existing government assets, primarily focusing on the power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom sectors, which constitute the bulk of the pipeline.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PMGS NMP's reliance on open-source technology, its hosting on Meghraj, and its integration of ISRO and Survey of India data are all accurate details of its technological foundation. The use of GIS technology and a comprehensive database of ongoing and future projects are crucial aspects of the Master Plan's design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NMP does target ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), the statement misrepresents the sectoral distribution.  Roads and Railways actually constitute the largest portions of the NMP, not power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom. The top 5 sectors capture ~83% of the aggregate pipeline, with roads and railways accounting for a significantly larger share than the sectors mentioned in statement 2.  The statement incorrectly prioritizes the contribution of certain sectors.


**5. With reference to the regulation of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as all collateral-free loans to individuals or groups belonging to low-income households with an annual income up to ₹3,00,000.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises through commercial banks, NBFCs, etc., categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with the 2024 Union Budget enhancing the Tarun category limit to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI's definition of microfinance loans accurately reflects the criteria mentioned: collateral-free loans to low-income households (annual income up to ₹3,00,000). This definition is crucial for understanding the scope and target population of microfinance lending in India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The PMMY provides loans up to ₹10 lakh, categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun. The 2024 Union Budget did indeed enhance the limit for those who had successfully repaid previous Tarun loans to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus). This expansion of the PMMY reflects government efforts to support small and micro enterprises.  The details regarding the loan categories and the budget enhancement are factually accurate.


**1. With reference to Excise Duty in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Prior to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Central Excise Duty was levied on all manufactured goods for domestic consumption.
2.  Currently, excise duty is levied only on petroleum products and alcoholic beverages, with the latter being collected by state governments as "State Excise" duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Central Excise Duty was a significant indirect tax before GST, it wasn't levied on *all* manufactured goods.  Many goods were subject to other indirect taxes, and the scope of Central Excise Duty varied over time.  The GST significantly broadened the tax base and subsumed many existing indirect taxes, including a large portion of Central Excise Duty.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GST regime largely replaced Central Excise Duty, leaving only petroleum products and alcoholic beverages under the purview of excise duty.  Importantly, the excise duty on alcohol is collected at the state level, reflecting the states' power over the regulation of alcoholic products. This distinction is crucial in understanding the federal structure of India's tax system.  The continued application of excise duty to these specific goods highlights their unique characteristics within the broader tax framework.  The exclusion of most other goods reflects the success of GST in unifying indirect taxation.

**2. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  An IDS arises when the import duty on finished goods exceeds the import duty on the input goods used in their manufacture.
2.  An IDS in the GST regime leads to a blockage of funds for taxpayers due to accumulated Input Tax Credit (ITC), potentially causing working capital issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An Inverted Duty Structure (IDS) occurs when the tax rate on inputs is *higher* than the tax rate on the finished goods. This is the opposite of what is described in the statement.  The higher tax on inputs makes the finished goods more expensive, impacting competitiveness.  The statement confuses the relationship between tax rates on inputs and finished goods.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core problem with an IDS is that businesses pay more tax on their inputs than they collect on their sales.  This results in a credit balance (ITC) that cannot be fully utilized, effectively tying up working capital.  This can create significant financial challenges for businesses, especially smaller ones, and necessitate refunds, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.  The statement accurately captures this key consequence of an IDS within the GST system.

**3. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Bill, 2024, introduced indexation benefits for immovable properties acquired after a specific cut-off date.
2.  The amendment abolishing indexation benefits for immovable properties acquired *after* a specified date includes a grandfather clause protecting properties acquired before that date.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Bill, 2024, did *not* introduce indexation benefits for properties acquired after a certain date; it actually *removed* indexation benefits for such properties.  Indexation is a method to adjust capital gains for inflation, reducing the tax burden.  The statement misrepresents the effect of the amendment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The amendment eliminating indexation benefits for future acquisitions included a grandfather clause. This means that properties acquired before the specified cut-off date retain the benefit of indexation when calculating capital gains tax. This is a common provision in tax legislation to avoid retroactive changes that could severely impact taxpayers.  The grandfather clause mitigates the potential disruption caused by the change in tax law.

**4. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council is a statutory body established under Article 279 of the Constitution of India.
2.  Decisions within the GST Council require a two-thirds majority of the weighted votes, with states holding a two-thirds voting weight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is established under Article 279A of the Constitution, not Article 279.  Article 279 deals with the Finance Commission, a different constitutional body.  The error in the article number highlights the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The GST Council's decision-making process involves weighted voting, where states collectively hold a two-thirds majority and the central government holds one-third.  This reflects the federal nature of the Indian system and ensures that states have a significant voice in GST-related matters.  A two-thirds majority is required for decisions to be passed.  The statement accurately reflects the council's voting mechanism.


**5. With reference to the GST Appellate Tribunal, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a first appellate authority established under the Central GST (CGST) Act, 2017.
2. The Principal Bench of the GST Appellate Tribunal is located in Mumbai and is presided over by the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a *second* appellate authority, not the first.  Appeals initially go to the lower appellate authorities before proceeding to the Tribunal. The statement incorrectly identifies its position in the appeals process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the GST Appellate Tribunal does have a Principal Bench, it is located in New Delhi, not Mumbai. The statement contains an error regarding the location of the Principal Bench. The President presides over the Principal Bench.


**6. With reference to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBIC is responsible for the administration of direct tax laws in India.
2. The CBIC operates under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBIC is responsible for *indirect* taxes, not direct taxes. Direct taxes are levied on income and profits (e.g., income tax, corporate tax), while indirect taxes are levied on goods and services (e.g., GST, customs duty). The statement confuses the types of taxes administered by the CBIC.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBIC functions under the Department of Revenue, which is part of the Ministry of Finance.  This placement accurately reflects its role in the government's fiscal structure.


**7. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), consider the following statements:**

1. A DTAA aims to prevent the same income from being taxed twice in two different jurisdictions.
2. The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism within DTAAs to resolve double taxation disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary purpose of a DTAA is to prevent double taxation.  This protects taxpayers from paying tax on the same income in both their country of residence and the country where the income originates.  The statement accurately describes the core function of DTAAs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MAP is a crucial mechanism included in many DTAAs.  It provides a process for resolving disputes between taxpayers and tax authorities in different countries when double taxation arises.  This mechanism helps ensure fair and efficient tax administration in international transactions.  The statement accurately describes the role of the MAP.


**8. With reference to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. BEPS refers to tax strategies used by multinational enterprises to reduce their overall tax burden by shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions.
2. The Principal Purpose Test (PPT) is a measure introduced to counter BEPS by focusing on the main objective behind a transaction rather than its legal form.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. BEPS encompasses various strategies employed by multinational enterprises (MNEs) to artificially reduce their tax liability. These strategies often involve shifting profits to countries with lower tax rates or exploiting loopholes in tax laws.  The statement accurately defines the core concept of BEPS.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PPT is a key element in the BEPS initiative.  It aims to look beyond the formal structure of a transaction to assess its actual purpose. If the primary goal of a transaction is to obtain a tax advantage, the tax benefit may be denied even if the transaction complies with the letter of the law.  The statement accurately describes the function of the PPT in combating BEPS.


**9. With reference to the  Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIS is responsible for issuing the "Hallmark" certification for all types of precious metal articles.
2. The BIS was established under the BIS Act of 2016.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The BIS *does* issue the Hallmark certification for precious metals, but it's not responsible for *all* types.  There are specific regulations and processes for Hallmark certification, and not all precious metal articles automatically receive it. The statement overstates the BIS's role in Hallmark certification.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) was established under the BIS Act, 2016. This Act consolidated and updated the legal framework for the BIS's operations.


**10. With reference to  the  Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.
2. The Central Government can make the ISI mark mandatory for specific products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not mandatory for *all* products sold in India. It's mandatory only for certain products specified by the government through Quality Control Orders (QCOs). The statement overgeneralizes the scope of the ISI mark's mandatory application.

Statement 2 is correct. The Central Government has the power to make the ISI mark mandatory for specific products deemed essential for safety and quality.  This is done through the issuance of QCOs, giving the government flexibility in regulating product standards.


**11. With reference to  Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will come into effect from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, irrespective of their tier classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PCA framework for UCBs is slated to come into effect from April 1, 2025, not 2024.  The statement contains an error regarding the implementation date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework does *not* apply to all UCBs.  There are exceptions, such as those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  The statement makes an overly broad claim about the framework's applicability.


**12. With reference to  National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2. One of NUCFDC's key functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public deposits or have a customer interface, which is the case for NUCFDC. The statement misclassifies NUCFDC's NBFC type.

Statement 2 is correct.  A major role of NUCFDC is to provide financial assistance and support to UCBs to improve their financial health and stability.  This includes liquidity support and capital raising initiatives.


**13. With reference to  Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) as per the RBI's Omnibus Framework, consider the following statements:**

1. An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  An SRO's board of directors must include at least one-third independent members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI framework mandates that an SRO be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  The statement incorrectly specifies the profit status of the SRO.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI framework requires SROs to have a strong governance structure, including a minimum of one-third independent directors on their boards.  This ensures oversight and prevents conflicts of interest.


**14. With reference to  Wilful Defaulters as defined by the RBI, consider the following statements:**

1. A wilful defaulter is defined as a borrower with an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above who has diverted funds.
2. Lenders must establish an Identification Committee to determine whether a default is wilful.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While fund diversion is a characteristic of wilful default, the threshold for the outstanding amount is ₹25 lakh and above, not ₹1 crore.  The statement incorrectly states the financial threshold for classifying a borrower as a wilful defaulter.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI guidelines require lenders to set up an Identification Committee to thoroughly investigate and assess whether a default qualifies as wilful.  This committee plays a crucial role in the process of identifying and classifying wilful defaulters.


**15. With reference to  Inter Creditor Agreements (ICAs), consider the following statements:**

1. An ICA is a legally binding agreement between all lenders of a borrower, regardless of the proportion of outstanding credit.
2.  As per RBI guidelines, a decision in an ICA requires the agreement of lenders representing 75% by value of total outstanding credit facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While an ICA aims to bring all lenders to a common understanding, it doesn't require the agreement of *all* lenders.  A specific percentage of lenders, based on the value of outstanding credit, is sufficient for a decision to be binding on all lenders.  The statement incorrectly describes the threshold for agreement within an ICA.

Statement 2 is correct.  RBI guidelines stipulate that decisions in an ICA require the agreement of lenders representing 75% by value of the total outstanding credit.  This ensures that a significant portion of lenders are in consensus before a decision is binding.  The statement accurately reflects the RBI's stipulations for consensus in ICAs.


**16. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IBC brought the management and winding-up of insolvent entities under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2. The IBC consolidated various existing laws related to insolvency and bankruptcy into a single legislation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC brought the management and winding-up of insolvent entities under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI. SEBI regulates the securities market, while RBI is primarily responsible for banking regulation.  The statement incorrectly identifies the regulatory authority overseeing insolvency proceedings.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary aim of the IBC was to create a unified and streamlined framework for dealing with insolvency and bankruptcy, consolidating various existing laws.  This improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the insolvency resolution process.


**17. With reference to Household Savings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A decline in household financial savings directly leads to an increase in inflation.
2. Household savings in India are categorized into financial savings and physical savings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a decline in household financial savings can have various economic consequences, a direct link to an *increase* in inflation is not always guaranteed.  Other factors influence inflation, including monetary policy and global economic conditions. The statement oversimplifies the relationship between household savings and inflation.

Statement 2 is correct. Household savings in India are broadly classified into financial savings (like bank deposits, insurance) and physical savings (like gold, real estate). This categorization is important for understanding the structure of household wealth and investment patterns.


**18. With reference to the  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP aims to generate investment by selling government-owned assets outright.
2. The NMP has a target of generating ₹6 lakh crore over a period of five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP primarily focuses on *monetizing* government assets, which includes various methods like leasing, concessions, and public-private partnerships, not necessarily outright sales. The statement incorrectly describes the NMP's approach to asset utilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMP's target is ₹6 lakh crore over *four* years, not five. The statement contains an error regarding the timeframe.


**1. With reference to the administration of direct tax laws in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Income Tax Department, under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, is solely responsible for the administration of all direct tax laws.
2.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) plays a crucial role in formulating policies and providing overall strategic direction for the Income Tax Department's operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Income Tax Department is the primary agency for administering direct tax laws, it doesn't operate in complete isolation.  Other agencies and bodies within the Ministry of Finance, such as the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), contribute significantly to policy formulation, oversight, and overall strategic direction. The CBDT,  for instance, is responsible for framing policies related to direct taxes and providing overall guidance to the Income Tax Department.  The statement oversimplifies the complex structure of direct tax administration in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBDT is a crucial body in the Indian tax system. It's responsible for policy formulation, strategic direction, and overall supervision of the Income Tax Department.  Its role is vital in ensuring efficient and effective administration of direct tax laws.  The CBDT's functions extend beyond mere administrative tasks; they encompass policy development, interpretation of tax laws, and the resolution of complex tax issues.


**2. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), consider the following statements:**

1. A DTAA primarily aims to eliminate all forms of taxation on assets held by individuals or entities in two different countries.
2. The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) provides a mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes arising from tax treaties, but only those concerning purely juridical issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  DTAAs aim to *avoid* double taxation, not eliminate it entirely.  Double taxation arises when the same income or asset is taxed in two different jurisdictions.  DTAAs aim to provide a framework for allocating the right to tax between the countries involved, ensuring that income or capital is taxed only once, but not necessarily at zero tax rate in both countries.  They achieve this through specific provisions defining which country has taxing rights based on residency and source of income.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MAP mechanism is designed to resolve double taxation disputes arising from the interpretation or application of tax treaties.  This includes disputes of both a juridical (legal) and economic nature.  The scope of MAP is broad, encompassing various types of disagreements related to the allocation of taxing rights and the interpretation of treaty provisions, not limited to solely legal issues.


**3. With reference to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The BEPS initiative primarily focuses on preventing tax avoidance by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating within a single country.
2. The Principal Purpose Test (PPT), introduced as part of BEPS amendments, ensures that tax benefits under a DTAA are not granted if tax avoidance is the principal purpose of the transaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BEPS initiative targets multinational enterprises (MNEs) that utilize complex structures and strategies to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions, thereby eroding the tax base of countries where they operate. SMEs operating domestically are not the primary focus of BEPS. The initiative addresses the challenges posed by the globalized nature of large corporations and their ability to manipulate tax rules across borders.

Statement 2 is correct. The PPT is a crucial element of BEPS, designed to counter aggressive tax planning. It establishes a clear criterion that tax benefits under a DTAA will not be available if the main purpose of a transaction or arrangement was to obtain those benefits. This helps prevent artificial arrangements solely designed to reduce tax liabilities.


**4. With reference to the regulatory framework for cooperative banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently introduced stricter NPA provisioning norms specifically for urban cooperative banks, aligning them with commercial banks.
2. The RBI allows all cooperative banks to open new branches freely without seeking prior approval, thereby promoting financial inclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI has indeed revised NPA (Non-Performing Asset) provisioning norms for cooperative banks, particularly urban cooperative banks.  These revisions aim to strengthen the financial health and stability of these institutions by aligning their provisioning practices with those of commercial banks, ensuring that they adequately set aside funds to cover potential loan losses.  This enhances the transparency and accountability within the cooperative banking sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI does not allow all cooperative banks to open new branches freely without prior approval.  While some cooperative banks might have certain limits on branch expansion without prior approval, it is not a universal policy.  The RBI maintains regulatory oversight over branch expansion for all cooperative banks to ensure adherence to its guidelines and maintain the financial health of the banking system.


**5. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI's primary function is to promote and sustain competition in markets, primarily focusing on the interests of large corporations.
2. The CCI is empowered to prevent practices that adversely affect competition but lacks the authority to impose penalties on entities found to be in violation of competition law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CCI promotes and sustains competition, its focus extends beyond large corporations.  It safeguards the interests of all market participants, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers.  The CCI aims to create a level playing field where all businesses can compete fairly, benefiting consumers through lower prices, improved quality, and greater choice.  The statement incorrectly emphasizes a bias towards large corporations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CCI has the power to impose significant penalties on entities found to be in violation of competition law. These penalties can act as a deterrent against anti-competitive practices and help ensure compliance with competition regulations.  The statement incorrectly claims the CCI lacks this crucial enforcement power.


**6. With reference to the Coal sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's high dependence on coal imports is primarily due to the abundant availability of high gross calorific value (GCV) coal within the country.
2. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, restricted the participation of private entities in commercial coal mining.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's high dependence on coal imports is actually due to a *shortage* of high-GCV coal domestically.  Indian coal often has higher ash and sulfur content, making it less desirable for certain industries like iron and steel, which require high-quality coking coal typically imported from other countries. The statement misrepresents the reason for import dependence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, did the *opposite*; it specifically allowed for the auctioning of coal mines to private entities for commercial mining.  This was a significant policy change aimed at increasing coal production and reducing reliance on Coal India Limited.  The statement incorrectly attributes a restrictive role to the Act.


**7. With reference to the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce government investment in infrastructure projects by completely privatizing existing assets.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, but its recommendations are not binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's goal is to *monetize* existing government assets, generating investment through leasing or other forms of privatization, not to completely privatize them.  The government aims to leverage the private sector's capital and expertise to improve infrastructure while retaining some ownership or control over the assets. The statement misrepresents the NMP's objective.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates PPP projects, providing recommendations to the government. However, the government retains the final decision-making authority.  The committee's role is advisory, not binding.  Its recommendations are crucial in assessing the viability and risks of PPP projects, but the government is not obligated to follow them.



**8. With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1. The Inclusive Framework's two-pillar approach focuses solely on increasing the tax burden on multinational enterprises (MNEs) without considering the needs of developing countries.
2. The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS aims to update international tax rules, primarily benefiting developed countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Inclusive Framework's two-pillar approach aims to achieve a more equitable allocation of taxing rights between countries and establish a global minimum corporate tax rate.  While it addresses tax avoidance by MNEs, it also acknowledges the needs of developing countries by ensuring that they receive a fair share of tax revenue from MNEs operating within their borders. The statement misrepresents the framework's objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Multilateral Convention aims to update international tax rules to prevent BEPS, benefiting both developed and developing countries.  It seeks to create a more level playing field in the international tax system, preventing MNEs from exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules to avoid paying their fair share of taxes globally. The statement incorrectly suggests a bias towards developed nations.


**9. With reference to the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India Stack is a platform-centric DPI model, primarily focused on creating a single, centralized platform for all digital services.
2. The One Future Alliance aims to hinder the adoption of DPI in low and middle-income countries by restricting access to technology and funding.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India Stack is a *network-centric* DPI, not platform-centric. It comprises interconnected layers (identity, payments, data governance) that can be used by various platforms and applications, allowing for interoperability and innovation.  A platform-centric approach would involve a single dominant platform controlling all services, which is not the case with India Stack.  The statement incorrectly characterizes India Stack's architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The One Future Alliance aims to *promote* the adoption of DPI in low and middle-income countries by providing capacity building, technical assistance, and funding support.  It seeks to leverage India's experience with DPI to accelerate digital transformation in other nations. The statement misrepresents the Alliance's purpose.


**10. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. UPI was launched in 2016 and is solely operated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is a private sector entity established solely to operate UPI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UPI was indeed launched in 2016, it's not solely operated by the RBI.  It's operated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organization established under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, with participation from the RBI and Indian Banks' Association (IBA). The statement incorrectly attributes sole operational control to the RBI.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NPCI is not a purely private sector entity. It was incorporated in 2008 by the RBI and IBA.  Although it functions as an independent entity, it has a strong public sector involvement in its establishment and oversight. The statement misrepresents NPCI's ownership structure.  It operates multiple retail payments and settlement systems in India, not just UPI.


**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST subsumed all forms of excise duty, leaving no excise duty levied on any goods in India.
2.  Excise duty on alcoholic beverages is collected by the State Governments and is termed "State Excise" duty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GST did subsume many types of excise duty, it notably *did not* subsume excise duty on petroleum products and alcoholic beverages.  These continue to be levied separately.  The question plays on the general understanding that GST is a broad tax, creating a misconception that it covers everything. The fact that some excise duties remain outside the GST ambit is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the Indian tax system.

Statement 2 is correct. Excise duty on alcohol, alcoholic preparations, and narcotic substances is indeed collected by the State Governments and is specifically referred to as "State Excise" duty. This reflects the federal structure of India's tax system, where certain taxation powers are devolved to the states.  This point highlights the division of tax powers between the central and state governments under the GST regime.  The seemingly straightforward nature of the statement masks the complexity of intergovernmental fiscal relations in India.


**2. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where the GST rate on finished goods is higher than the GST rate on input goods used in their manufacture.
2.  IDS creates working capital issues for taxpayers due to the blockage of funds in the form of Input Tax Credit (ITC) resulting from high input tax.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The definition of IDS is inverted: the import duties (or GST rates in the context of domestic production) on *input goods* are higher than those on the *finished goods*. This creates a scenario where the tax paid on inputs exceeds the tax collected on sales, leading to a credit blockage.  The statement subtly reverses the key element of the definition, acting as a distractor for those with a superficial understanding of IDS.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core problem with IDS is the blockage of working capital.  Because the input tax paid is greater than the output tax collected, businesses are left with unutilized Input Tax Credit (ITC). This ties up their funds and creates cash flow problems.  This statement accurately points to the significant practical consequence of IDS on businesses, underscoring the economic implications of this tax structure.


**3. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions on immovable properties, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Bill, 2024, introduced indexation benefits for properties acquired after July 23rd, 2024.
2.  The amendment abolishing indexation benefits includes a grandfather clause, protecting properties acquired before July 23rd, 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Bill, 2024, *did not* introduce indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* July 23rd, 2024.  Instead, it continued the *abolishment* of indexation benefits for properties acquired after this date. This statement is a direct reversal of the actual amendment, making it a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendment, while removing indexation benefits for future acquisitions, did include a grandfather clause. This clause protects properties acquired before July 23rd, 2024, allowing them to still benefit from indexation despite the new rules. The inclusion of a grandfather clause is a common feature in tax law changes, but this detail is often overlooked, making it a good testing point for detailed knowledge.


**4. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  A DTAA aims to ensure that an asset is taxed twice, once in each country where it is declared.
2.  The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA included a Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to prevent treaty abuse for tax evasion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The entire purpose of a DTAA is to *avoid* double taxation of the same asset in two different countries.  The statement directly contradicts the fundamental goal of a DTAA, making it a highly effective distractor for those who only have a basic understanding of the concept.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA did indeed incorporate a Principal Purpose Test (PPT). This test is designed to prevent the abuse of treaty provisions for tax evasion by ensuring that tax benefits are only granted if obtaining such benefits was not the primary purpose of the transaction.  This statement highlights the complexities and ongoing efforts to strengthen international tax cooperation and combat tax avoidance.


**5. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1.  NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  NaBFID's entire shareholding is currently held by the Government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  This statement substitutes one regulatory body for another, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the institution's oversight.  The subtle difference between RBI and SEBI's roles makes this a challenging distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Currently, the Government of India holds the entire shareholding of NaBFID. This highlights the government's significant role in infrastructure financing and development in India. The straightforward nature of this statement contrasts with the more nuanced point about regulatory oversight, making it a comparatively easier part of the question.


**6. With reference to India's e-commerce market, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2022, India's e-commerce sector contributed approximately 17% of the total retail market.
2.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In 2022, India's e-commerce sector contributed approximately 7% of the total retail market, not 17%.  The statement significantly inflates the actual percentage, creating a plausible but incorrect option.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India. This restriction aims to protect the domestic unorganized retail sector.  This statement directly contradicts the existing FDI policy in the e-commerce sector, testing the candidate's understanding of regulatory frameworks within the sector.  The seemingly simple nature of the statement masks the complexity of India's FDI policy.


**7. With reference to the Equalisation Levy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Equalisation Levy was initially introduced in India in 2018 and applied to online advertisements.
2.  The 2% Equalisation Levy on e-commerce supplies was applicable only to non-resident e-commerce operators without a permanent establishment in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Equalisation Levy was introduced in 2016, not 2018. This seemingly minor detail tests the candidate's precise recall of facts related to the timeline of tax policy changes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2% Equalisation Levy on e-commerce supplies was applicable to non-resident e-commerce operators *with* a permanent establishment in India.  The statement reverses a key condition for the application of the levy, making it a strong distractor.  This highlights the need for careful reading and precise understanding of tax regulations.


**8. With reference to the  Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), consider the following statements:**

1. ONDC is a for-profit organization under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).
2. ONDC utilizes a platform-centric model, connecting shoppers, platforms, and retailers through a single centralized platform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ONDC is a Section 8 company, meaning it's a non-profit organization. The statement incorrectly characterizes ONDC's organizational structure, testing the candidate's knowledge of its legal and operational framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ONDC uses a network-centric model, not a platform-centric model.  This is a crucial distinction that differentiates ONDC from traditional e-commerce platforms.  The statement conflates two distinct architectural approaches to digital commerce, highlighting the need for a clear understanding of technological underpinnings of policy initiatives.


**9. With reference to Household Savings Rate in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A decline in financial savings poses challenges for the banking sector in managing credit risk but not in maintaining liquidity.
2.  In India, the household sector typically generates a deficit in savings relative to its investments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. A decline in financial savings does indeed pose challenges for the banking sector in managing credit risk *and* maintaining liquidity.  The statement omits the impact on liquidity, attempting to mislead the candidate through an incomplete description of the consequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In India, the household sector typically generates a *surplus* in savings relative to its investments, not a deficit. This surplus is then lent to other sectors of the economy.  The statement reverses the actual relationship between household savings and investment, testing the candidate's understanding of macroeconomic dynamics.


**10. With reference to  the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI includes nine core industries and accounts for over 50% of the weight of items in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2. Petroleum Refinery Products has the lowest weight in the ICI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICI includes only eight core industries, not nine, and accounts for 40.27% of the weight of items in the IIP, not over 50%. The statement inflates both the number of industries and their overall weight in the IIP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Petroleum Refinery Products has the *highest* weight in the ICI, not the lowest.  The statement completely reverses the relative importance of this sector within the ICI.  This question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the composition and weighting of the ICI.


**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1. The GST is a direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services, aiming to simplify the indirect tax structure in India.
2.  The GST Council, a constitutional body, is responsible for setting tax rates and making policy decisions related to GST, with the Union Finance Minister as its chairperson and decisions requiring a simple majority vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GST is an *indirect* tax, not a direct tax.  Direct taxes are levied on income and wealth (e.g., income tax), while indirect taxes are levied on goods and services (e.g., GST, sales tax). The aim of GST is indeed to simplify the indirect tax structure by subsuming various existing indirect taxes into a single, unified system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Union Finance Minister chairs the GST Council, and it is indeed a constitutional body established under Article 279A, decisions require a three-fourths majority of weighted votes, not a simple majority.  The states collectively hold a two-thirds voting weight, while the Centre holds one-third.  This weighted voting structure reflects the federal nature of India's governance and ensures that states have a significant voice in GST-related decisions.


**2. With reference to the GST Appellate Tribunal, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a first appellate authority established under the Central GST (CGST) Act, 2017, hearing appeals against orders passed by the assessing officers under the CGST Act, 2017 and State GST Acts.
2. The Principal Bench of the GST Appellate Tribunal is presided over by the President, appointed by the Government for a tenure of 5 years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a *second* appellate authority, not a first appellate authority.  Appeals first go to the Appellate Authority under the CGST Act, 2017 and State GST Acts before proceeding to the GST Appellate Tribunal.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President of the GST Appellate Tribunal is appointed by the Government after consultation with the Chief Justice of India or his/her nominee. The tenure is 3 years or until the age of 70, whichever is earlier, not 5 years or until the age of 65.


**3. With reference to Excise Duty in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Excise duty is a direct tax levied on goods manufactured in India and used for consumption within India, collected by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).
2.  Prior to the implementation of GST, excise duty was levied at both the central and state levels, with the state-level excise duty applying to goods like petroleum and alcohol.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. Excise duty is an *indirect* tax, not a direct tax. It is levied on goods manufactured within the country for domestic consumption.  The collecting authority is the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), not the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). The CBDT handles direct taxes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Prior to GST, excise duty was primarily levied at the central level (Central Excise Duty).  State-level excise duty existed, but it applied mainly to alcohol and, in some cases, petroleum products.  The statement incorrectly suggests that state-level excise duty applied to a wider range of goods.


**4. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is a digital platform developed using proprietary technology, integrating data from various ministries to streamline infrastructure projects.
2.  PM GatiShakti's approach is driven by seven engines, focusing on integrated infrastructure development across railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes *open-source* technology, not proprietary technology. It is built on a GIS platform and hosted on Meghraj (Government of India's cloud), integrating data from various ministries to improve coordination and reduce project delays.  The use of open-source technology is crucial for transparency and accessibility.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PM GatiShakti initiative is indeed driven by seven engines, representing key infrastructure sectors, aimed at creating a holistic and integrated approach to infrastructure development. This integrated approach is designed to improve efficiency and reduce logistical bottlenecks.


**5. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is the primary government agency responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs in India.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, playing a key role in ensuring the viability and effectiveness of such projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The primary government agency responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs in India is the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs, not the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).  While NIIF plays a significant role in infrastructure financing, its mandate is distinct from the policy-making aspects handled by the Department of Economic Affairs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee does indeed evaluate central sector PPP projects.  This evaluation process helps to ensure that projects are financially sound, technically feasible, and aligned with broader development goals.  This committee plays a crucial role in mitigating risks and promoting transparency in PPP projects.


**6. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC).
2.  One of NUCFDC's key functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) by raising capital and offering fund management and consultancy services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI, as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, reflecting NUCFDC's role in supporting UCBs.  SEBI regulates the securities market, while RBI regulates banks and NBFCs.

Statement 2 is correct.  Providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs is a core function of NUCFDC.  This support includes raising capital, offering fund management services, and providing consultancy to improve the financial health and operational efficiency of UCBs.


**7. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will be implemented from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs irrespective of their tier classification, including those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the implementation date. The PCA framework for UCBs will be implemented from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  The delay reflects the time required for the transition from the existing SAF to the new PCA framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the applicability. The PCA framework applies to UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, *excluding* those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID). UCBs under AID are already under intensive supervision, making the PCA framework redundant in their case.


**8. With reference to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), consider the following statements:**

1. APAs are agreements between a taxpayer and a tax authority to determine the arm's length price (ALP) of international transactions for a maximum of three future years.
2. The Indian APA scheme is voluntary and supplements other mechanisms like the appeal process and Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) for resolving transfer pricing disputes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect about the duration. APAs determine the arm's length price (ALP) for a maximum of *five* future years, not three. This longer duration provides greater certainty to taxpayers regarding their transfer pricing obligations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian APA scheme is indeed voluntary, offering taxpayers a proactive way to resolve potential transfer pricing disputes. It complements other dispute resolution mechanisms, such as appeals and DTAAs, providing a more comprehensive framework for managing international tax obligations.


**9. With reference to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBDT is a statutory body under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1962, responsible for the administration of direct tax laws through the Income Tax Department.
2. The CBDT functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, and its primary role is the administration of indirect tax laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The CBDT is a statutory body responsible for administering direct tax laws.  While the act mentioned is slightly off (it's the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963, not 1962), the overall description of its role is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBDT's primary role is the administration of *direct*, not indirect, tax laws.  Indirect tax laws are administered by different bodies, such as the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).


**10. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and provisioning norms for cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI has recently revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks, mandating that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) under Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms must be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account.
2. Under the revised norms, cooperative banks are prohibited from allocating any net profits to the BDDR after complying with IRACP norms and other regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI has indeed revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks, requiring that provisions for BDDR under IRACP norms be treated as expenses in the Profit and Loss Account. This strengthens the regulatory framework for managing NPAs in cooperative banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The revised norms do *not* prohibit cooperative banks from allocating net profits to the BDDR after complying with IRACP and other regulations.  They are allowed to allocate net profits to the BDDR after meeting all regulatory requirements.  This allows banks to strengthen their capital reserves and better absorb potential losses from NPAs.


**11. With reference to Co-lending in the Indian financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Co-lending is an arrangement where a bank and a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) partner to provide loans, with the bank bearing the entire credit risk.
2. Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group, subject to certain conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding risk sharing. In co-lending, the credit risk is shared between the bank and the NBFC, not solely borne by the bank.  Typically, the NBFC bears a minimum of 20% of the credit risk, with the bank bearing the remaining portion.  This risk-sharing mechanism is crucial to the co-lending model.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding promoter group involvement. Banks are explicitly *not* allowed to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of the lending process.


**12. With reference to Wilful Defaulters in the Indian banking system, consider the following statements:**

1. A wilful defaulter is defined as an entity with an outstanding amount of ₹10 lakh and above, who has deliberately defaulted on loan repayments.
2. The RBI's directions on the treatment of wilful defaulters apply only to commercial banks and do not extend to other financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the outstanding amount threshold.  A wilful defaulter is defined as an entity with an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above, not ₹10 lakh.  This higher threshold reflects the significance of the default and the potential impact on the financial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the scope of application.  The RBI's directions on the treatment of wilful defaulters apply to a broader range of financial institutions, including not only commercial banks but also other regulated entities.  This broader application ensures consistent treatment of wilful defaulters across the financial sector.


**13. With reference to Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1. IDS refers to a situation where the GST rate paid on purchases is less than the GST rate payable on sales, leading to a refund of Input Tax Credit (ITC).
2. IDS affects domestic industries by making products less competitive in the export market due to higher input costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IDS is characterized by import duties (or GST rates) on input goods being *higher* than on finished goods, not lower.  This creates a situation where the Input Tax Credit (ITC) cannot be fully utilized, leading to blocked working capital and refund-related issues.

Statement 2 is correct. IDS does indeed negatively impact domestic industries. Higher input costs make products more expensive, reducing their competitiveness, particularly in the export market where they face competition from producers in countries without such a structure.


**14. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions on immovable properties, consider the following statements:**

1. The recent amendment to LTCG tax provisions abolishes indexation benefits for properties acquired after 1st January 2024, without any grandfathering clause.
2. The amendment aims to simplify the tax regime for immovable properties and reduce tax avoidance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the grandfathering clause. While the amendment does abolish indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* a certain date (July 23, 2024, not January 1, 2024), it *does* include a grandfathering clause.  Properties acquired before the cutoff date retain the benefit of indexation.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The amendment aims to streamline the tax regime and potentially reduce instances of tax avoidance related to the valuation of properties.  The removal of indexation, while impacting some taxpayers, is intended to create a more straightforward and equitable system.  However, the aim is not solely to reduce tax avoidance but also to simplify the overall tax calculation.


**15. With reference to the Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) in Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are permitted to establish DEFs to accumulate profits to pay dividends in future years, even if profits are insufficient or the bank posts a net loss.
2. The RBI has recently mandated that UCBs transfer the money in their DEFs to general reserves or free reserves to improve regulatory capital treatment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While UCBs may have historically used DEFs, current rules *prohibit* making dividend payments from previously accumulated profits or reserves if the bank posts a net loss or has insufficient current profits.  The establishment of DEFs is not permitted under current regulations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI has indeed directed UCBs to transfer funds from their DEFs to general reserves or free reserves. This measure is a one-time initiative to improve the regulatory capital position of UCBs and to ensure compliance with banking regulations.  This is crucial for maintaining the financial stability of UCBs.



**1. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  Geological Survey of India has identified significant reserves of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

2.  The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to create a fair and stable international tax system, with developing countries largely supporting its terms of reference.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The roles of MAP and APA are reversed. A Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism to *resolve* transfer pricing disputes that have already arisen, while an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) is designed to *prevent* such disputes by providing certainty regarding transfer pricing methodologies for future transactions.  The distinction is crucial in understanding their respective roles in international tax compliance.

Statement 2 is correct. The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to establish a more just and equitable international tax system.  The initiative has indeed received substantial support from developing countries, including India, who often face challenges in collecting taxes from multinational corporations.  The support reflects their desire for a more balanced and fairer approach to international taxation, addressing concerns about tax avoidance and revenue loss.  The opposition from some industrialized nations highlights the complexities and political considerations involved in achieving global consensus on tax reform.

These are significant national infrastructure initiatives, and their exclusion would contradict the plan's stated comprehensive nature.  The PMGS NMP aims to integrate all modes of transportation and infrastructure development under a single umbrella, thus encompassing rather than excluding such major projects.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for all aspects of PPP project implementation, including on-ground execution.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in setting policies and guidelines for PPPs at the policy level, it doesn't handle all aspects of implementation, including on-the-ground execution.  Implementation involves numerous agencies, ministries, and private sector partners. The statement oversimplifies the complex process of PPP project implementation, suggesting a centralized control that doesn't exist.  Policy formulation and on-ground execution are distinct phases requiring different expertise and coordination mechanisms.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a strategic initiative aimed at attracting private investment by monetising existing government assets.  The stated target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25) reflects the scale of the ambition and the expected financial returns.  This initiative is a key component of the government's broader strategy to leverage existing infrastructure for economic growth and improved public services.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF doesn't solely provide grants; it involves a significant loan component.  The text explicitly states that ₹1 Lakh Crore will be provided by banks and financial institutions as loans, with an interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage.  This highlights the blended finance approach of the AIF, combining grants and loans to maximize impact.  The statement misrepresents the funding mechanism, focusing only on one aspect while ignoring the crucial role of loans.

Statement 2 is correct. The recent expansion of the AIF includes a provision for convergence with Component-A of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM).

2.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021, includes indicators from the global MPI model, with additions such as Maternal Health and Bank Account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 Global MPI report indicates that India has the *largest* number of people living in extreme poverty among the 112 countries surveyed, not the lowest.  The statement presents a direct contradiction of the factual data presented in the provided text.  The large population of India contributes significantly to the overall number of people in multidimensional poverty, despite progress in poverty reduction.

Statement 2 is correct. India's National MPI (NMPI), implemented in 2021 by NITI Aayog, incorporates indicators from the global MPI model and adds two crucial indicators – Maternal Health and Bank Account.

2.  The Agreement on Agriculture, negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in Marrakesh, primarily focuses on market access, domestic support, and export subsidies, with tariffication being a key component of market access reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Marrakesh Agreement and its impact on the WTO. Statement 1 correctly identifies the agreement's role in establishing the WTO and expanding the scope of trade regulations beyond goods to encompass services and intellectual property rights.  The Uruguay Round, culminating in the Marrakesh Agreement, fundamentally reshaped global trade governance. The shift from GATT to WTO marked a significant evolution, establishing a more robust and comprehensive framework for international trade dispute resolution and cooperation.  The inclusion of intellectual property rights reflects a growing recognition of their importance in the global economy.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the key components of the Agreement on Agriculture, a crucial part of the Marrakesh Agreement. The three pillars—market access, domestic support, and export subsidies—represent a comprehensive approach to reforming agricultural trade policies.  Tariffication, the conversion of non-tariff barriers into tariffs, was a major goal of the agreement, aiming to increase transparency and predictability in agricultural markets.  The complexities and controversies surrounding domestic support, particularly concerning subsidies and their impact on global agricultural markets, highlight the ongoing challenges in implementing the Agreement on Agriculture.


**2. With reference to the WTO's Public Stockholding (PSH) policy, consider the following statements:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the objective and mechanism of the PSH policy.  Governments use it to purchase agricultural produce from farmers at a guaranteed minimum price, ensuring farmers receive a fair return for their produce, even during periods of low market prices.  The stored grains are then used for distribution to vulnerable populations, thereby enhancing food security and reducing poverty.  The policy's significance lies in its dual role of supporting farmers and ensuring food security, especially in developing countries.

Statement 2 correctly explains the "de minimis" limits within the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture.  These limits are crucial because they define the threshold beyond which government subsidies are considered trade-distorting.  The use of 1986-88 reference prices for calculating these limits is a point of contention, as developing countries argue that these outdated prices do not accurately reflect current production costs and market realities.  The ongoing debate over the "de minimis" limits highlights the inherent tension between the need to support domestic agriculture and the principles of fair trade within the WTO framework.

The ultimate goal is to use trade as a catalyst for sustainable development and poverty reduction in these countries.


**7. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, is a fund specifically designed to support the development of advanced 5G telecom infrastructure in major metropolitan cities.
2.  DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), and it aims to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas to ensure affordable access to telecom services in remote and rural regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While DBN does aim to improve telecom services, its focus is not limited to 5G infrastructure in major cities. The fund's primary purpose is to provide financial support for expanding telecom services in underserved areas, including rural and remote regions.

Statement 2 is correct.  DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, and it directly replaced the USOF (Universal Service Obligation Fund).  The DBN's objective is to ensure that affordable telecom services are available across the country, particularly in areas lacking adequate connectivity.  This aligns with the broader goal of bridging the digital divide and promoting inclusive growth.


**8. With reference to India Stack, consider the following statements:**

1.  India Stack is a proprietary technology platform developed by a private consortium of Indian technology companies to promote digital payments and identity management.
2.  It comprises three interconnected layers: an identity layer (e.g., Aadhaar), a payments layer (e.g., UPI), and a data governance layer (e.g., DigiLocker), supporting initiatives like the One Future Alliance and the Global DPI Repository.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India Stack is not a proprietary platform developed by a private consortium. It's a foundational digital public infrastructure (DPI) initiative developed and promoted by the Indian government, aiming to provide open and interoperable digital services.  It’s a public good.

Statement 2 is correct.  India Stack's architecture indeed comprises three interconnected layers: an identity layer (Aadhaar being a key example), a payments layer (with UPI as a prominent component), and a data governance layer (DigiLocker is a good illustration).  These layers work together to support various digital services and initiatives, including those focused on global DPI advancement such as the One Future Alliance and the Global DPI Repository.



**9.  With reference to the impact of a higher trade deficit on the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. A higher trade deficit always leads to a positive impact on the economy by increasing the availability of goods and boosting domestic investment through capital goods imports.
2.  Negative impacts of a higher trade deficit include depletion of foreign exchange reserves, currency depreciation, and potential adverse effects on the country's credit rating, leading to increased borrowing costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increased access to a wider range of goods and potential boosts to investment from capital goods imports are possible benefits of trade, a higher trade deficit doesn't guarantee a positive overall economic impact. The negative consequences often outweigh the benefits.

Statement 2 is correct. A higher trade deficit can have several serious negative repercussions.  The need to pay for the excess of imports over exports depletes foreign exchange reserves, putting downward pressure on the domestic currency's value.  A widening current account deficit (often linked to a high trade deficit) can negatively affect a country's credit rating, making it more expensive to borrow funds internationally.  These factors can hinder economic growth and stability.


**10. With reference to initiatives to promote Indian exports, consider the following statements:**

1. The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) Scheme is designed to provide subsidies to exporters, thereby making Indian products more competitive in the global market.
2. The Trade Connect e-Platform, a single-window initiative, primarily aims to facilitate international trade by providing real-time access to trade-related information for large multinational corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RoDTEP Scheme is designed to refund taxes, duties, and levies at various levels (central, state, and local) on exported goods.  This effectively reduces the cost of production for exporters, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of Indian products in the international market.  It helps offset indirect taxes that are not directly refunded under other schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Trade Connect e-Platform does aim to facilitate international trade by providing real-time access to trade-related information, its primary focus is on assisting Indian exporters, especially Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), not just large multinational corporations. The platform simplifies processes and provides crucial information to smaller businesses that may lack the resources to navigate complex international trade procedures.


**11. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the nodal department responsible for formulating FDI policy, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the final authority that approves all FDI proposals.
2. FDI in India can be channeled through either the automatic route (requiring no government approval) or the government route (requiring government approval).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DPIIT is the nodal department for formulating FDI policy in India, RBI is not the final authority for approving all FDI proposals.  The approval process depends on the route chosen: automatic or government route.  RBI's role is mainly in managing foreign exchange regulations related to FDI.

Statement 2 is correct. FDI inflows into India can be made through two routes: the automatic route and the government route.  The automatic route allows for investments without needing prior government approval, while the government route requires specific approvals from relevant authorities based on the nature and sector of investment.


**12. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan primarily focuses on developing the nation's rail infrastructure by integrating various railway projects across different states.
2.  It is built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India's cloud), and integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps to provide a comprehensive database of ongoing and future infrastructure projects across various ministries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PM GatiShakti does incorporate railway projects, it's not solely focused on rail infrastructure.  It's a multi-modal approach encompassing seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  The plan integrates various infrastructure projects across different modes of transport.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes open-source technology and is hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud platform.  It leverages ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps to create a comprehensive and integrated database of ongoing and future infrastructure projects from various ministries.  This integrated approach aims to improve planning and coordination across different government agencies.


**13. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of all PPP projects at the state level.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, playing a crucial role in assessing the viability and feasibility of such projects before their approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is primarily responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs at the central level, not at the state level. State governments have their own mechanisms for managing and overseeing PPP projects within their respective jurisdictions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a crucial role in evaluating central sector PPP projects. This committee assesses the project's financial viability, technical feasibility, and overall risk profile before the project is given the go-ahead. This ensures a thorough evaluation of projects using public funds.


**14. With reference to India's port sector and related initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. Mormugao Port Authority, located in Karnataka, is the first port in India to introduce Green Ship Incentives (Harit Shrey scheme) through the Environmental Ship Index (ESI) platform.
2.  Dry ports, also known as inland ports, aim to provide efficient connectivity to seaports for landlocked regions, reducing pressure on coastal ports and facilitating international trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mormugao Port Authority did introduce the Harit Shrey scheme, its location is in Goa, not Karnataka.  It was indeed the first port in India to implement this green shipping incentive program through the ESI platform.

Statement 2 is correct. Dry ports, strategically located inland, significantly enhance connectivity to seaports for regions that are landlocked.  This reduces the need for long-distance overland transport, leading to cost savings and efficiency gains.  They ease the burden on coastal ports by processing a portion of the cargo inland.  The establishment of dry ports promotes international trade and economic growth in inland regions.


**15. With reference to the Container Port Performance Index (CPPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPPI 2023, released by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence, ranked several Indian ports among the top 100 global ports, highlighting the growth and efficiency of India's container port sector.
2. The CPPI 2023 ranked Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) as the top-performing container port globally, showcasing India's dominance in the global container shipping industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CPPI 2023, released jointly by the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence, indeed recognized several Indian ports among the top 100 globally. This reflects the progress India has made in improving the efficiency and capacity of its container port infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While several Indian ports performed well in the CPPI 2023,  the top-ranked container port globally was not an Indian port; it was Yangshan Port in China.  This indicates that while India's port sector is improving, it still has some distance to cover to reach the top ranks globally.


**16. With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is a global initiative that aims to curb tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) through the implementation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 10%.
2.  The framework adopts a two-pillar approach: Pillar One focuses on reallocating part of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs to countries where their consumers are located, and Pillar Two introduces a global minimum corporate tax (GMCT).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS aims to combat tax avoidance by MNEs, the global minimum corporate tax rate it promotes is 15%, not 10%.

Statement 2 is correct. The framework's two-pillar approach is accurately described. Pillar One focuses on reallocating a portion of the profits of large and highly profitable MNEs to the countries where their customers are based.  Pillar Two introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate (GMCT) of 15% to ensure that MNEs pay a minimum level of tax regardless of where they are headquartered.


**17. With reference to Duty Drawback and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), consider the following statements:**

1. Duty Drawback, as per the Customs Act, 1962, is a system where the government provides direct financial assistance to exporters to improve their competitiveness in international markets.
2.  The CBIC, part of the Department of Revenue under the Union Ministry of Finance, is responsible for the electronic disbursement of duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts using the Public Finance Management System.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Duty Drawback under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, is not direct financial assistance but a rebate on customs duties paid on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods.  It's a mechanism to offset some of the costs associated with exporting, not a direct subsidy.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBIC (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs) is indeed responsible for the electronic disbursement of duty drawback amounts directly into the bank accounts of exporters. This is done using the Public Finance Management System, improving transparency and efficiency in the process.


**18. With reference to Windfall Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. A windfall tax is a temporary tax imposed on all businesses and industries irrespective of their profitability, to generate additional revenue for the government.
2. It is levied on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favorable market conditions, aiming to capture some of these excess profits for public benefit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Windfall taxes are not imposed on all businesses indiscriminately. They are targeted at specific industries that are experiencing unusually high profits due to external factors that are not directly related to their own efforts or efficiencies.  The tax is usually temporary.

Statement 2 is correct.  Windfall taxes are specifically designed to capture a portion of the unexpectedly high profits generated by certain industries during periods of favorable market conditions. This is often seen as a way to ensure that the public benefits from these gains, especially when the profits are considered excessive or due to factors outside the companies' direct control (e.g., sudden surge in commodity prices).  These taxes are often temporary.


**19. With reference to the Marrakesh Agreement and the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, established the WTO, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and expanded the scope of trade regulation to include services, intellectual property rights, and investment.
2. The Marrakesh Agreement primarily focused on reducing tariffs on agricultural products while maintaining significant protectionist measures for industrial goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, marked the culmination of the Uruguay Round of negotiations under GATT.  It led to the creation of the WTO, a more comprehensive and robust organization for regulating international trade.  The WTO's mandate extends beyond tariffs on goods to encompass services, intellectual property rights, and other aspects of international commerce.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Marrakesh Agreement's aim was not to selectively reduce tariffs on agricultural products while maintaining protectionism for industrial goods.  The agreement sought to create a more balanced and comprehensive multilateral trading system with a broader scope than GATT, covering a wider range of trade-related issues.  While agricultural trade was a significant part of the negotiations, there wasn't a focus on disproportionately favoring industrial goods.


**20. With reference to the WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) and the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue, consider the following statements:**

1. The MC13, held in Abu Dhabi, reached a permanent agreement on the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue, allowing developing countries to maintain their food security programs without facing trade penalties.
2.  Developing countries advocate for an increase in the de minimis limit for agricultural subsidies and amendments to the formula used to calculate price support subsidies under the PSH policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MC13 in Abu Dhabi did not reach a permanent solution on the PSH issue.  The issue remains a point of contention between developed and developing countries, with disagreements on how to accommodate developing countries' food security programs without violating WTO rules on agricultural subsidies.

Statement 2 is correct. Developing countries have consistently argued for a higher de minimis limit for agricultural subsidies under the PSH policy. This would allow them to procure and store larger quantities of food grains for their domestic programs without facing trade sanctions.  They also push for changes in the formula used to calculate price support subsidies, arguing that the current formula is outdated and unfairly penalizes them.


**1. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions, but excludes copyright protection.
2.  The Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, enabling developing countries to produce patented products without the patent owner's consent, but only under specific, limited circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement explicitly *does* incorporate provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions,  including copyright protection.  These conventions form the foundation of international intellectual property law, and TRIPS builds upon and strengthens their provisions within the framework of the WTO.  Excluding copyright protection would significantly weaken the agreement's scope and purpose.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs clarification. The TRIPS Agreement *does* allow for compulsory licensing, a crucial provision for developing countries to access essential medicines and technologies. However, it's not an unrestricted right.  The agreement sets out conditions under which compulsory licensing can be invoked, emphasizing the need for public health considerations, national emergencies, and the provision of fair compensation to the patent holder.  The statement's phrasing of "only under specific, limited circumstances" accurately reflects this nuanced reality.  The unrestricted use implied in the original statement is inaccurate. Therefore, option (b) is the most appropriate.


**2. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  From India's independence until economic liberalization, GFCF consistently remained below 5% of GDP.
2.  Private investment, as a percentage of GDP, experienced a sustained increase from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a peak exceeding 30% by 2020-21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF fluctuated, it did not consistently remain below 5% of GDP in the period between independence and economic liberalization.  The provided text indicates that investment remained slightly above or below 10% of GDP during this era, fluctuating around that figure. This shows a significant difference from the claim in statement 1.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text clearly states that private investment began to *drop* from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a low of 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21 before rising again.  This contradicts the assertion of a sustained increase and a peak exceeding 30%.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the historical trend of GFCF and private investment in India.


**3. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans exclusively to individuals belonging to high-income households.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans through microfinance institutions (MFIs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's definition of microfinance loans specifically targets *low*-income households, not high-income ones. The income threshold mentioned in the text further reinforces this. The statement incorrectly reverses this crucial aspect of microfinance targeting.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While PMMY does provide loans to small and micro enterprises, it doesn't exclusively channel funds through MFIs.  The scheme utilizes various financial intermediaries, including commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), to reach its target beneficiaries.  The statement wrongly restricts the disbursement channels of PMMY.  Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies.


**4. With reference to the Monetary Policy of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's monetary policy framework mandates a fixed inflation target of 4% irrespective of economic conditions.
2.  Expansionary monetary policy involves the central bank raising interest rates to curb inflation and reduce borrowing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's monetary policy framework employs *flexible* inflation targeting, not a fixed target.  While the current target is 4% (with a tolerance band), this target is reviewed and adjusted periodically based on macroeconomic conditions and evolving economic realities.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of the RBI's approach.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Expansionary monetary policy aims to *stimulate* economic activity, not curb it. This is achieved by *lowering* interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment and spending. The statement describes the actions of *contractionary* monetary policy, which is used to control inflation by reducing money supply.  Therefore, both statements present fundamentally flawed understandings of RBI's monetary policy mechanisms.


**5. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index solely focuses on the banking sector's reach and usage, ignoring other financial services.
2.  The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing complete financial exclusion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is a *comprehensive* index, incorporating data from banking, investments, insurance, postal services, and the pension sector.  It doesn't limit its scope to just the banking sector as claimed in the statement.  The statement inaccurately restricts the index's scope.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  In the FI-Index, 100 represents *complete* financial *inclusion*, not exclusion.  A score of 0 indicates complete exclusion, and the index measures the progress towards full inclusion.  The statement incorrectly reverses the meaning of the index's endpoints.  Both statements demonstrate a misunderstanding of the FI-Index's design and purpose.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. RB-IOS covers all types of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), irrespective of their size or customer interface.
2. The scheme aims to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints related to services provided by regulated entities, but only for complaints exceeding a certain monetary threshold.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RB-IOS does *not* cover all NBFCs. The text specifies that it covers NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above and those authorized to accept deposits or have a customer interface.  The statement incorrectly broadens the scheme's coverage.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  RB-IOS aims to provide *cost-free* redressal of complaints, regardless of the monetary value involved.  There is no mention of a monetary threshold for complaint eligibility in the provided text. The statement introduces a non-existent condition for complaint resolution.  Therefore, both statements contain factual inaccuracies.


**7. With reference to the RBI's surplus transfer to the government, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the RBI to transfer its entire net interest income to the central government.
2. The Economic Capital Framework (ECF) dictates that surplus transfer depends solely on the realized equity maintained by the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of *profits* to the central government, not the *entire* net interest income.  A significant portion of the RBI's income is used for operational expenses and maintaining reserves.  The statement presents a misrepresentation of the legal mandate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the realized equity is a factor in determining surplus transfers under the ECF, it's not the *sole* determinant. The ECF also considers the economic capital (CGRA), which includes reserves and unrealized gains or losses.  The statement oversimplifies the complex process of surplus transfer determination.  Thus, both statements are inaccurate.


**8. With reference to Ways and Means Advances (WMA), consider the following statements:**

1. WMA is a facility exclusively available to State Governments, not the Union Government.
2.  Special WMA (now SDF) carries a higher interest rate compared to Normal WMA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the WMA facility is available to both State/UT Governments *and* the Union Government. The statement incorrectly restricts the availability of this crucial financial instrument.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Special WMA (now SDF) has a *lower* interest rate than Normal WMA. This is a key feature designed to provide more favorable terms during periods of greater financial stress. The statement reverses the relationship between interest rates for the two types of WMAs.  Both statements misrepresent crucial aspects of the WMA scheme.


**9.  With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides grants to farmers for all types of agricultural investments, irrespective of their viability or alignment with overall agricultural development goals.
2.  The AIF credit guarantee coverage is exclusively provided by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF supports the creation of agricultural infrastructure through loans, not unrestricted grants.  Furthermore, the projects funded are expected to be "viable," implying a careful assessment of their economic feasibility and contribution to agricultural growth. The statement incorrectly describes the nature and scope of AIF funding.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While CGTMSE is involved in providing credit guarantee coverage under AIF, the text explicitly mentions that NABARD's subsidiary, NAB Sanrakshan, has also been incorporated to extend this coverage, especially to Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).  The statement incorrectly limits the providers of credit guarantees.  Both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the AIF's operational mechanisms.


**10. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Economic Affairs' Private Investment Unit is solely responsible for the implementation of all PPP projects in India.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by liquidating existing government assets and transferring ownership to private entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Department of Economic Affairs' Private Investment Unit is responsible for *policy-level matters* concerning PPPs, but it does not directly implement individual projects.  The implementation involves various agencies and ministries at different levels of government. The statement incorrectly assigns the entire responsibility for implementation to a single unit.

Statement 2 is also inaccurate. The NMP aims to generate investment through *monetization*, which involves leveraging existing government assets to attract private investment.  This doesn't necessarily imply a complete transfer of ownership.  Monetization strategies can include long-term leases, concessions, or other arrangements that allow private entities to participate in the asset's operations and revenue generation while retaining government ownership. The statement incorrectly defines monetization as outright sale. Both statements contain significant misinterpretations of the PPP framework in India.


**11. With reference to the  "crowding out" effect, consider the following statements:**

1. The "crowding out" effect refers to a situation where increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, reducing private investment.
2. The "crowding out" effect is always detrimental to economic growth, as it completely eliminates private sector investment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "crowding out" effect accurately describes the phenomenon where increased government borrowing, often financed through increased taxes or bond issuance, drives up interest rates. This makes it more expensive for private businesses to borrow money for investment, leading to a reduction in private sector investment.  This is a well-established concept in macroeconomics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the "crowding out" effect can negatively impact economic growth by reducing private investment, it doesn't completely eliminate it.  The extent of the crowding out effect depends on various factors, including the overall state of the economy, the responsiveness of private investment to interest rate changes, and the effectiveness of government spending.  The statement presents an extreme and inaccurate view of the effect's consequences.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**12. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR is published annually by the World Bank, providing a comprehensive assessment of human development across nations.
2.  The HDR 2023-2024 highlighted a decline in India's Human Development Index (HDI) value and ranking compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is published annually by the *United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)*, not the World Bank.  The statement incorrectly attributes the publication to the wrong organization.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The HDR 2023-2024 actually showed an *increase* in India's HDI value and an improvement in its ranking compared to the previous year.  The statement misrepresents the key findings of the report regarding India's human development progress.  Therefore, both statements are factually inaccurate.


**13. With reference to PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. PM GatiShakti is solely focused on developing road infrastructure across India.
2. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a proprietary, closed-source technology platform for its operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM GatiShakti is a multi-modal approach encompassing seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  The statement incorrectly restricts its focus to only road infrastructure.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is built on *open-source* technology, hosted on the government's cloud platform, Meghraj.  The statement inaccurately describes the technology platform used.  Therefore, both statements are fundamentally flawed in their understanding of the PM GatiShakti initiative.


**1. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR, released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 1990, primarily focuses on economic growth indicators to assess human development.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII), a component of the HDR, measures inequalities across various dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the HDR does consider economic factors, its primary objective is to examine major global challenges affecting human development and suggest recommendations.  It uses the Human Development Index (HDI) as its core measure, encompassing health, education, and standard of living, going beyond purely economic indicators.  The HDR's focus is on a broader, more holistic view of human development than just economic growth.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is indeed a key component of the HDR. It meticulously measures gender disparities across three crucial dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment (including educational attainment and political representation), and economic opportunity (reflected in labor market participation).  The GII provides a comprehensive assessment of gender inequality, vital for understanding the overall human development picture presented in the HDR.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects aspects of the HDR.


**2. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 MPI report, jointly published by the UNDP and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), indicated that India had the second-largest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty.
2. The MPI measures poverty based solely on income levels, providing a straightforward indicator of economic deprivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 MPI report did indeed highlight that India had the largest number (234 million) of people living in acute multidimensional poverty among the 112 countries assessed. This underscores the significant challenge of multidimensional poverty in India despite overall economic progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MPI fundamentally differs from traditional income-based poverty measures.  Instead of focusing solely on income, it considers multiple deprivations across various dimensions, including health, education, and living standards.  A person is classified as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in at least one-third of the weighted indicators. This holistic approach captures the complexities of poverty beyond simple economic indicators.  Thus, only statement 1 aligns with the MPI's methodology and findings.


**3. With reference to India's seaweed farming, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation contributes significantly to India's GDP, currently accounting for over 5% of the national output.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seaweed farming has significant economic potential and is part of the aquaculture sector, its contribution to India's GDP is currently much lower than 5%.  The text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% of India's GDP, and seaweed farming is a component of this sector.  Therefore, a contribution exceeding 5% is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana explicitly aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons per year by 2025. This ambitious target reflects the government's focus on promoting seaweed farming for its economic and environmental benefits.  Consequently, only statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided regarding India's seaweed farming initiatives.


**4. With reference to the Indian silk industry, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world's largest silk producer, accounting for over 50% of global silk production.
2. Karnataka contributes the largest share to India's total silk production, followed by Andhra Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a major silk producer, it is not the world's largest. The provided text explicitly states that India is the *second* largest silk producer, accounting for 42% of global production in 2023. This clearly refutes the claim of being the largest producer with over 50% market share.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately identifies Karnataka as the leading contributor to India's silk production (approximately 32%), followed by Andhra Pradesh.  This reflects the geographical distribution of silk production within India. Therefore, only statement 2 is consistent with the given information.


**5. With reference to the Digital Agriculture Mission (DAM), consider the following statements:**

1. The DAM's Agri Stack component primarily focuses on providing subsidized inputs to farmers, such as seeds and fertilizers.
2. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes remote sensing data from sources like RISAT-1A and VEDAS to provide real-time agricultural information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Agri Stack, a key component of the DAM, is not primarily focused on providing subsidized inputs.  Its core function is to create a farmer-centric digital public infrastructure (DPI) to streamline services and scheme delivery. This involves creating farmer IDs, geo-referenced village maps, and a digital crop sown registry.  Subsidies are not the central focus of the Agri Stack.

Statement 2 is correct. The Krishi DSS effectively integrates remote sensing data from sources such as RISAT-1A and VEDAS (Visualization of Earth observation Data and Archival System) of the Department of Space.  This integration allows for the provision of real-time information on crop conditions, weather patterns, and water resources, aiding informed decision-making in agriculture. Thus, only statement 2 accurately describes the DAM's features.


**6. With reference to the livestock sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India ranks first globally in terms of antibiotics use in animals.
2. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are unified genomic chips developed for cattle and buffaloes respectively, aimed at improving livestock productivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that India ranks *fourth* globally in antibiotics use in animals, not first. This indicates a significant challenge related to antimicrobial resistance in the Indian livestock sector but doesn't align with the claim of holding the top rank.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Gau Chip" for cattle and the "Mahish Chip" for buffaloes are indeed unified genomic chips developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. These chips aim to enhance livestock productivity by providing genetic information useful for breeding and disease management.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to monetary policy tools used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) injects liquidity into the banking system, stimulating economic growth.
2. The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is a tool used by the RBI to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Increasing the CRR and SLR has the opposite effect of injecting liquidity; it *reduces* liquidity in the banking system.  Higher CRR and SLR mandates mean banks have less money available for lending and other activities, thus acting as a contractionary monetary policy tool.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The VRRR (Variable Rate Reverse Repo) is used to absorb excess liquidity. The VRR (Variable Rate Repo) is used to *inject* short-term liquidity. The statement confuses the two.  Both statements misrepresent the effects of these monetary policy tools.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**8. With reference to the revised Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI recently revised PSL guidelines to discourage lending to small businesses in economically disadvantaged districts.
2. The revisions aim to promote smaller loan sizes in economically disadvantaged districts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's revision of PSL guidelines aims to *promote*, not discourage, lending to small businesses in economically disadvantaged areas.  The objective is to improve financial inclusion and support economic development in these regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The revisions to PSL norms specifically focus on promoting smaller loan sizes in economically disadvantaged districts. This is intended to make credit more accessible to a wider range of borrowers in these areas.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the purpose of the revised PSL guidelines.


**9. With reference to initiatives related to agricultural technology, consider the following statements:**

1.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) is India's first data exchange platform that solely focuses on providing weather forecasts to farmers.
2. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) is an initiative aimed at improving yield estimation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ADeX is indeed India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, it does not solely focus on weather forecasts.  It holds crucial datasets related to farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown data, providing a comprehensive information system.  The statement oversimplifies ADeX's function.

Statement 2 is correct. KISAN is specifically designed to improve yield estimation using space technology and geoinformatics.  This initiative leverages advanced technologies for more accurate and efficient crop assessment.  Thus, only statement 2 accurately describes the stated initiatives.


**10. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1. MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure fair prices for farmers' produce.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MSP is announced at the *beginning*, not the end, of the sowing season. This allows farmers to make informed decisions about their crop choices and planting schedules based on the guaranteed minimum price.  The timing is crucial for planning agricultural activities.

Statement 2 is correct. The CACP is indeed responsible for recommending MSP, considering various production costs. The final decision on MSP is made by the CCEA, chaired by the Prime Minister, ensuring government approval and policy integration.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate regarding the MSP process.


**11. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Agricultural exports in India registered an 8% increase in 2023-24, exceeding the target set by the 2018 policy.
2. The 2018 Agricultural Export Policy aimed to achieve agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that agricultural exports in India saw an 8% *decline*, not an increase, in 2023-24.  This indicates a shortfall in achieving the ambitious export targets set by the policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2018 Agricultural Export Policy did indeed aim for agricultural exports worth $60 billion by 2022.  The actual outcome fell short of this target, highlighting challenges in achieving the policy's objectives.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided on India's agricultural export policy.


**12. With reference to the abolition of angel tax, consider the following statements:**

1. The abolition of angel tax primarily impacts domestic investors, excluding foreign investments.
2. The abolition of angel tax is expected to encourage reverse flipping of startups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Budget 2023-24 broadened the scope of the angel tax abolition to include foreign investments (with certain exceptions).  The statement incorrectly restricts the impact to only domestic investors.

Statement 2 is correct. The abolition of angel tax is indeed anticipated to promote reverse flipping of startups.  This is because removing the tax burden on investments makes it more attractive for Indian companies established overseas to shift their legal headquarters back to India.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the consequences of the angel tax abolition.


**13. With reference to the Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules introduced a "Certificate of Inventorship" to protect the intellectual property rights of inventors.
2. The time limit for filing a request for examination of a patent application has been increased from 31 months to 48 months.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, did introduce a Certificate of Inventorship to formally acknowledge the contribution of inventors in patented inventions, strengthening inventor rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rules actually *reduced* the time limit for filing a request for examination, not increased it.  The time limit was reduced from 48 months to 31 months, aiming to expedite the patent examination process.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes a provision of the amended rules.


**14. With reference to the regulation of patents in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Patents Act, 1970, is not compliant with the WTO's TRIPS Agreement.
2.  The 2005 amendment to the Patents Act extended product patent protection to pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Patents Act, 1970, is explicitly stated to be *compliant* with the WTO's TRIPS Agreement.  This reflects India's commitment to international intellectual property rights standards.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2005 amendment to the Patents Act did extend product patent protection to pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, aligning Indian patent law with international practices in these crucial sectors.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**15. With reference to the concept of "Middle Income Trap", consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank classifies economies with a per capita Gross National Income (GNI) between US$13,847 and US$100,000 as middle-income countries.
2.  The "3i strategy" proposed by the World Bank to overcome the middle-income trap involves Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Bank's classification of middle-income countries (MICs) uses a lower threshold.  The text specifies the range as US$1,135 to US$13,846.  The statement uses an inaccurate range for MIC classification.

Statement 2 is correct. The World Bank's report on the middle-income trap does indeed recommend the "3i strategy"—Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation—as a pathway for countries to overcome this challenge and transition to high-income status.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the World Bank's recommendations.


**16. With reference to the Preston Curve, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preston Curve demonstrates a direct, linear relationship between income and life expectancy, with higher income consistently leading to proportionally higher life expectancy.
2. The Preston Curve was first proposed by an Indian economist.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preston Curve doesn't show a strictly linear relationship. While it generally demonstrates a positive correlation between income and life expectancy, the relationship is not perfectly linear, and there are variations and plateaus depending on other socio-economic factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Preston Curve was first proposed by American sociologist Samuel H. Preston in 1975, not an Indian economist.  The statement incorrectly attributes the origin of the curve.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the characteristics of the Preston Curve.



**1. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 MPI report, jointly published by UNDP and OPHI, indicated that approximately 18% of the global population, or 1.1 billion people, lived in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
2.  India, with 234 million people, was identified as the country with the single largest number of individuals experiencing extreme poverty according to the 2024 MPI report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect findings from the 2024 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report.  The report, a collaborative effort between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), presented a comprehensive analysis of multidimensional poverty across numerous countries.  Statement 1 correctly cites the report's key finding regarding the global prevalence of acute multidimensional poverty—approximately 1.1 billion people, representing about 18% of the global population, living in such conditions.  Similarly, statement 2 correctly highlights India's significant contribution to this global figure, identifying it as the nation with the largest number of people experiencing extreme poverty, totaling 234 million.  Therefore, both statements are factually accurate according to the 2024 MPI report.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements, which are independently verifiable through the report's data.  Understanding the MPI's methodology and its implications for global development strategies is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. With reference to India's Intellectual Property (IP) rankings, consider the following statements:**

1. India's ranking in the Global Innovation Index (GII) is consistently higher than its position in the International Property (IP) Index.
2.  In a recent assessment, India's rank in the IP Index was 42 out of 55 economies, while its position in the GII was 40 out of 132 economies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided data shows that India's ranking in the IP Index (42 out of 55) is *lower* than its ranking in the Global Innovation Index (GII) (40 out of 132).  While both indices assess different aspects of innovation and intellectual property, the statement incorrectly asserts a consistent higher ranking in the GII.  Statement 2 is correct; it accurately reflects the numerical rankings of India in both the IP Index and the GII as reported in the source material.  The difference in the number of economies included in each index (55 for the IP Index and 132 for the GII) further underscores the distinct methodologies and scopes of these two ranking systems.  Understanding the nuances of different innovation and IP indices is important for analyzing India's economic performance and global competitiveness, a key area for UPSC examination.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either misrepresent the relationship between the two rankings or fail to accurately reflect the provided data.


**3. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty, adopted by consensus among over 150 countries including India, aims primarily to replace existing international agreements on intellectual property rights (IPR) to ensure a more unified approach.
2.  One of the treaty's key objectives is to enhance the efficiency and transparency of patent systems, thereby preventing the erroneous granting of patents for inventions that lack novelty.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The treaty's aim is *not* to replace existing international agreements on intellectual property, but rather to complement them by specifically addressing the intersection of intellectual property, genetic resources, and traditional knowledge.  It seeks to create a more comprehensive framework, not a replacement.  Statement 2 is correct.  A core objective of the treaty is to improve the quality and transparency of patent processes, thereby reducing the likelihood of patents being granted to inventions that are not novel or lack originality. This directly addresses concerns about biopiracy and the misappropriation of traditional knowledge.  The treaty acknowledges the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and aims to ensure fair and equitable benefit-sharing.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either misrepresent the treaty's primary purpose or fail to recognize its specific objectives regarding patent systems.  Understanding the complexities of international intellectual property agreements and their impact on developing countries is crucial for the UPSC exam.


**4.  With reference to India's seaweed farming initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025, significantly boosting India's contribution to the global aquaculture sector which currently contributes 1.5% to the nation's GDP.
2. The National Institute of Ocean Technology – Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI) has spearheaded offshore seaweed cultivation efforts in the Andaman region, utilizing advanced GIS-based mapping technology to monitor cultivation sites.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana does indeed have an ambitious target of reaching 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.  The statement also correctly notes the current contribution of the fishing and aquaculture sector to India's GDP (1.5%).  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While NIOT-ACOSTI is involved in offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region, the statement incorrectly links this initiative to the use of advanced GIS-based mapping technology for monitoring cultivation sites. While a GIS-based portal for viewing seaweed cultivation sites is mentioned in the source material, it's not directly linked to NIOT-ACOSTI's specific Andaman project.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the facts or fail to differentiate between the accurate and partially inaccurate statements.  The UPSC exam often tests knowledge of specific government schemes and their objectives; this question tests that knowledge.


**5. With reference to the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds (NMEO-Oilseeds), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMEO-Oilseeds, approved for implementation from 2024-25 to 2030-31, aims to achieve a 69.7 million-tonne increase in primary oilseed production by 2030-31, thereby significantly reducing India's dependence on edible oil imports.
2.  A key feature of the NMEO-Oilseeds is the establishment of 600 value chain clusters, providing farmers with access to high-quality seeds, training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), and advisory services on weather and pest management, all facilitated through the 'Seed Authentication, Traceability & Holistic Inventory' (SATHI) portal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMEO-Oilseeds targets an increase in primary oilseed production to 69.7 million tonnes by 2030-31, but this is the *total* production target, not an *increase* from the 2022-23 level. The statement misrepresents the data by framing the target as an increase rather than a total production goal.  Statement 2 is correct.  The NMEO-Oilseeds initiative does indeed include the development of 600 value chain clusters, aiming to enhance the support provided to farmers. The SATHI portal is also a key component of this initiative, facilitating access to resources and information.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the details of the NMEO-Oilseeds.  The other options are incorrect because they either misinterpret the production target or fail to accurately reflect the scheme's features.  The UPSC exam regularly assesses knowledge of government schemes and their implementation details.  This question specifically tests the understanding of the NMEO-Oilseeds program.


**6. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) to ensure adherence to financial market regulations.
2.  The institution's primary objective is to foster long-term non-recourse infrastructure financing in India, including the development of related bonds and derivatives markets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NaBFID is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI, as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI) under sections 45L and 45N of the RBI Act, 1934. The statement incorrectly identifies the regulatory body and the type of financial institution.  Statement 2 is correct.  The primary objective of NaBFID is indeed to support the development of long-term non-recourse infrastructure financing in India, including the development of the associated bonds and derivatives markets.  This is a key aspect of the institution's mandate.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the misidentification of the regulatory body in statement 1.  The UPSC exam often tests the knowledge of financial institutions and their regulatory frameworks.  This question specifically assesses understanding of NaBFID's regulatory structure and objectives.


**7. With reference to India's e-commerce sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian e-commerce market is projected to reach a valuation of $325 billion by 2030, driven largely by the growth of inventory-based e-commerce models, which are characterized by 100% FDI under the automatic route.
2.  Key initiatives to promote e-commerce in India include the draft e-Commerce Policy, the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), and the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, all aimed at creating a conducive regulatory environment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the projected valuation of $325 billion by 2030 is accurate, the statement incorrectly states that inventory-based e-commerce models are the primary driver of this growth and that they allow 100% FDI under the automatic route.  In reality, FDI is *not* permitted in inventory-based models to protect India's domestic retail sector.  The primary growth driver is the marketplace model, which does allow 100% FDI under the automatic route.  Statement 2 is correct.  The mentioned initiatives—the draft e-Commerce Policy, ONDC, and the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020—are all aimed at creating a favorable regulatory environment for the growth of the e-commerce sector in India.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1 concerning FDI in inventory-based models.  The UPSC exam frequently assesses understanding of India's economic policies and their impact on various sectors.  This question specifically tests knowledge of the e-commerce sector and its regulatory framework.


**8. With reference to the Preston Curve, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preston Curve, first proposed in 1975 by Samuel H. Preston, is a graphical representation of the relationship between a country's income level and its life expectancy, demonstrating a strong positive correlation.
2.  India's economic growth trajectory is frequently analyzed using the Preston Curve, which highlights the significant improvement in life expectancy alongside the country's rising per capita income.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Preston Curve and its application in analyzing India's development. Statement 1 correctly identifies Samuel H. Preston as the originator of the curve in 1975 and accurately describes its core function: illustrating the positive correlation between a nation's income level and its citizens' life expectancy.  Statement 2 correctly points out the frequent use of the Preston Curve in analyzing India's development, demonstrating the link between its economic progress and improvements in life expectancy.  The curve serves as a valuable tool for understanding the impact of economic growth on social indicators.  Therefore, both statements are correct and provide a comprehensive understanding of the Preston Curve and its relevance to India's development narrative.  All other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.  The UPSC exam often tests the understanding of economic concepts and their application in analyzing a country's development.  This question specifically tests knowledge of the Preston Curve and its relevance to India's growth story.



**1. With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation contributes significantly to India's GDP, forming a major part of the national economy.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025, focusing primarily on offshore cultivation in the Andaman region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seaweed farming is part of aquaculture, which contributes 1.5% to India's GDP,  it's not a major part of the national economy. The contribution of seaweed cultivation itself is a smaller fraction within that 1.5%. The statement exaggerates its economic significance.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana does indeed have a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.  While the initiative encompasses various aspects of fisheries development, the focus on seaweed is a significant component.  The mention of *primarily* focusing on offshore cultivation in the Andaman region is a slight overstatement;  while the Andaman region is a key area for offshore cultivation initiatives, the PMMSY's seaweed cultivation efforts are not exclusively limited to that region.


**2. With reference to the Central Silk Board (CSB), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's silk production, encompassing all varieties—Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga—accounts for approximately 50% of the global silk production.
2.  Karnataka consistently holds the highest share in India's total silk production, significantly surpassing other states like Andhra Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is the second largest silk producer globally,  holding approximately 42% (not 50%) of global production in 2023. The statement inflates India's share of the global market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka is a major silk-producing state, contributing around 32% of India's total silk production, it doesn't *consistently* hold the highest share and significantly surpass other states like Andhra Pradesh. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate depiction of the dynamic nature of silk production across different Indian states.


**3. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (WIPO Treaty), consider the following statements:**

1. The WIPO Treaty is a legally binding international agreement that prioritizes the protection of intellectual property rights over the rights of indigenous communities regarding traditional knowledge.
2.  India's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) played a crucial role in the negotiation and adoption of this WIPO Treaty, showcasing India's leadership in protecting its traditional knowledge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WIPO Treaty aims to address the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK) in a balanced way.  It doesn't prioritize IP rights over the rights of indigenous communities.  The treaty acknowledges the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and seeks to prevent the erroneous granting of patents for non-novel inventions, thus protecting traditional knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the TKDL is a significant initiative by India to protect its traditional knowledge, its role in the negotiation and adoption of the WIPO Treaty was not a *crucial* or *leadership* defining one. The treaty was adopted by consensus among more than 150 countries, and many factors influenced its creation and adoption.



**4. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's improved ranking in the GII 2024 primarily reflects significant advancements in its infrastructure and credit investment sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's improved ranking in GII 2024 reflects progress across various areas, attributing it *primarily* to advancements in infrastructure and credit investment is an oversimplification. The GII considers multiple factors, including institutions, human capital, research, knowledge creation and diffusion, and creative outputs.  India's top rank in lower middle-income economies for knowledge and technology outputs also signifies the importance of other factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GII 2024 methodology uses both quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess innovation.  While quantitative data like patents and R&D expenditure are considered, qualitative aspects related to institutions, human capital, and the environment supporting innovation are also incorporated into the assessment.


**5. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Global MPI 2024 report indicates that India has the second-largest number of people living in extreme poverty, surpassed only by China.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI) incorporates indicators specifically related to maternal health and bank account ownership, reflecting a broader approach to poverty measurement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global MPI 2024 report shows India has the largest number of people living in extreme poverty (234 million), not the second largest.  The statement incorrectly places India in the second position.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's NMPI, introduced in 2021, includes the 10 original indicators of the global MPI model and adds two more: maternal health and bank account ownership. This expansion reflects a broader understanding of poverty, encompassing access to financial services and maternal healthcare.


**6. With reference to  India's Technical Textiles sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's technical textiles market is the world's largest, driven by significant government support through initiatives like the National Technical Textiles Mission.
2. The government's efforts to promote technical textiles include mandatory usage across all sectors of the Indian economy, ensuring widespread adoption.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's technical textiles market is the fifth largest globally, not the largest. While the National Technical Textiles Mission aims to boost the sector, the statement incorrectly claims it is the largest market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian government has mandated the usage of technical textiles in *several* central ministries and departments, not *all* sectors of the Indian economy.  The statement overstates the extent of mandatory adoption.  While the government is actively promoting the use of technical textiles, complete mandatory adoption across all sectors is not yet in place.


**7. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI, released by the Ministry of Finance, includes sectors like automobiles and information technology, providing a comprehensive overview of India's industrial output.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICI is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the Ministry of Finance.  More importantly, the ICI only includes eight core industries (fertilizers, cement, natural gas, crude oil, coal, electricity, steel, and petroleum refinery products); it does not include sectors like automobiles and information technology.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Petroleum refinery products do have the highest weight (28.04%) in the ICI calculation, followed by electricity (19.85%).  These two sectors significantly influence the overall index value due to their substantial weight.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies allows developing countries and least developed countries a transition period of two years, but the statement incorrectly implies this applies to all member countries.  The elimination of harmful subsidies is a phased approach with different timelines for different categories of countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India has *not* yet ratified the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.  The statement incorrectly claims that India has already adopted the agreement.  India has specific concerns and demands regarding the agreement, especially concerning the “polluter pays principle” and “common but differentiated responsibilities”.


**9. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement, a product of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was implemented in 1990, significantly shaping the global intellectual property rights landscape.
2. The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for intellectual property protection, allowing member countries flexibility in exceeding these standards to provide greater protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement came into force on January 1, 1995, not 1990. The statement has an inaccurate date.

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property protection, allowing member countries the flexibility to implement stronger protections if they choose.  This flexibility allows countries to adapt the agreement to their specific needs and circumstances.


**10. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its associated indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR, published annually by the World Bank, uses the Human Development Index (HDI) as its core measure of human development.
2. India's performance in the Gender Inequality Index (GII) has consistently improved, reflecting significant progress in gender equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The statement incorrectly identifies the publishing organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GII ranking has shown improvement in specific years (e.g., a jump of 14 places in 2022),  it doesn't reflect *consistent* improvement.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of the fluctuating nature of India's progress in gender equality.  The GII score itself reflects a complex reality with various factors influencing the ranking.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" aim to improve productivity through tracking,  the statement falsely claims they are not widely implemented due to high costs. The passage doesn't explicitly mention widespread implementation challenges related to cost. The question tests the candidate's ability to discern factual information from assumptions.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. The NADCP's primary focus is indeed FMD and Brucellosis. However, the claim that it *largely ignores* other diseases is an overstatement; the program's scope might be limited to these two major diseases but doesn't entirely exclude attention to others.  This tests the candidate's ability to evaluate the accuracy of a statement based on partial truth. The question subtly challenges the candidate to avoid making generalizations based on limited information.


**3.  With reference to India's seaweed farming initiatives, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that agricultural exports registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the target. This directly contradicts the statement, testing the candidate's ability to recall key data points.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TIES does aim to improve infrastructure,  it's presented as a broader scheme supporting various export-related projects, including border haats and land custom stations, not solely cold chain infrastructure.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the scheme's scope.  The option focuses on a specific aspect of TIES to create a plausible distractor.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all 22 crops, including Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops, without any government intervention.
2. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the sole nodal agency responsible for procuring all MSP-covered crops from farmers across the country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP *recommends* MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, highlighting the involvement of the government beyond the CACP's recommendations. This tests the candidate's understanding of the decision-making process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While FCI is a major procuring agency for wheat and paddy, it is not the *sole* agency responsible for procuring all MSP-covered crops. Other agencies might also be involved, depending on the crop and region.  This tests the candidate's awareness of the complexities of the procurement system.  The question employs a deliberate oversimplification to create a misleading statement.


**6. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1. ADeX is India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, primarily focused on providing farmers with access to credit and insurance products through a centralized digital platform.
2. ADeX holds three primary datasets: farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops-sown data, but does not integrate with other relevant agricultural databases for a more holistic view.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ADeX is a data exchange platform for farmer services, the statement misrepresents its function by focusing solely on credit and insurance.  ADeX's role is broader than just providing access to financial products. This tests the candidate's understanding of the platform's overall purpose.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage accurately describes ADeX's three primary datasets. However, the addition of "but does not integrate..." is a deliberate attempt to mislead candidates who might assume further integration capabilities without explicitly checking the text. This tests the candidate's ability to critically assess information based on what is explicitly stated.


**9.  With reference to the  "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector", consider the following statements:**

1. The pilot project of this plan involves only 11 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) across 11 states, limiting its initial impact on national grain storage capacity.
2. The initiative aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of grain storage within the cooperative sector, but does not address challenges related to post-harvest losses and inefficient logistics.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the pilot project involves 11 PACS across 11 states, limiting its initial scope.  The question directly tests the candidate's ability to recall specific numerical details.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage focuses on enhancing storage within the cooperative sector, it doesn't explicitly state that it *doesn't* address post-harvest losses or logistics. The absence of this information in the passage does not imply its non-existence in the actual plan.  The statement creates a false negative by assuming a lack of attention to these issues.  This tests the candidate's ability to avoid making assumptions based on incomplete information.



**10. With reference to the Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. These rules apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons, found in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
2. The rules mandate the use of the modified United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC) and Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) Template for exploration and feasibility studies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  This tests the candidate's ability to understand the limitations and exclusions of a policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that the rules mandate the use of the modified UNFC and CRIRSCO Template for exploration stages and feasibility studies.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the specific technical standards adopted.  The use of technical terminology increases the question's difficulty.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.  I have attempted to create challenging questions with plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's aquaculture initiatives:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) primarily focuses on enhancing post-harvest infrastructure and strengthening the value chain, with minimal emphasis on increasing fish production.
2. The Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS), a key technology promoted under PMMSY, involves the continuous recycling of water in fish culture tanks without any filtration or removal of waste products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMSY does address post-harvest infrastructure and value chain strengthening, a core objective is to significantly increase fish production and productivity.  It's an umbrella scheme aiming to address multiple gaps in the sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. RAS is designed to recycle water *after* removing suspended particles and metabolites using mechanical and biological filters.  The continuous recycling is crucial, but the filtration process is integral to its function and environmental sustainability.  The description in statement 2 omits the vital filtration component, making it factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to India's seaweed farming initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is solely considered as a separate agricultural practice and not an integral part of aquaculture.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 10 million tonnes per year by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NMEO-Oilseeds aims to significantly increase domestic edible oil production, achieving complete self-sufficiency by 2030-31 is not explicitly stated and is arguably unrealistic given global market dynamics.  The target is to meet a significant percentage of domestic demand, not 100%.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The mission's strategy explicitly includes enhancing extraction efficiency from secondary sources like cottonseed and rice bran, in addition to focusing on primary oilseed crops.  The statement misrepresents the comprehensiveness of the mission's approach.


**4. With reference to India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are genomic chips developed to enhance the productivity of only indigenous bovine breeds, excluding crossbred cattle.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The app provides multilingual information on popular ornamental fish *species*, not just commercial aspects.  The focus is broader than solely commercial information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The app is explicitly mentioned as providing information in eight Indian languages.  The statement falsely restricts the language availability to just two.


**10. With reference to the establishment of Incubation Centres for fisheries, consider the following statements:**

1. The three incubation centres established are located in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal.
2. These centres primarily focus on supporting large-scale corporate ventures in the fisheries sector, with limited support for cooperatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The three incubation centres are located in Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Kochi, not in the states mentioned.  The locations are specifically named in the text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The centres explicitly aim to promote fisheries start-ups *and* cooperatives.  The statement wrongly suggests a focus on large-scale corporate ventures only.


**1. With reference to KISAN and ADeX, consider the following statements:**

1. KISAN utilizes space technology and geoinformatics for improved crop yield estimation, while ADeX is India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, holding datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown.
2.  ADeX exclusively focuses on providing real-time weather updates to farmers, whereas KISAN is primarily concerned with the assessment of crop damage due to natural calamities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes both KISAN and ADeX. KISAN leverages space technology and geoinformatics to enhance crop yield estimation accuracy. ADeX, as India's inaugural data exchange platform for farmer services, maintains crucial datasets encompassing farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and sown crops.  These datasets are vital for efficient service delivery and policy formulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADeX's scope is far broader than just real-time weather updates; it encompasses a comprehensive range of farmer-centric data.  KISAN's focus is not limited to assessing crop damage from natural calamities; it plays a significant role in yield prediction and overall agricultural planning.  The statement misrepresents the core functionalities of both platforms.


**2. Consider the following statements about Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1.  The MSP is determined solely by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) based on market fluctuations and international prices, aiming to ensure fair prices for farmers.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, considering various production costs, and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) finalizes the decision.  The MSP is announced before the sowing season.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FCI is a crucial player in procuring agricultural produce at MSP, the determination of MSP is not solely its responsibility.  The process involves a multi-stage assessment that begins with the CACP's recommendations.  The statement wrongly attributes the sole decision-making power to the FCI, ignoring the CACP and CCEA's roles.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the MSP determination process.  The CACP, a body responsible for analyzing agricultural costs and prices, submits its recommendations to the CCEA, which ultimately approves the MSP.  The timing of the announcement—before the sowing season—is also accurate, allowing farmers to plan their cultivation based on guaranteed minimum prices.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. In 2023-24, India's agricultural exports surpassed the ambitious target set by the 2018 policy, primarily due to increased demand for rice and marine products in international markets.
2.  Rice constitutes a significant portion of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices;  while vegetable oil forms a large portion of agricultural imports, followed by pulses and fruits/vegetables.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 policy. The statement contradicts this information by claiming an export surplus and citing increased demand as the primary driver.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the composition of India's agricultural exports and imports.  The text clearly indicates that rice is a leading export, followed by marine products and spices, while vegetable oil accounts for a significant share of agricultural imports, followed by pulses and fruits/vegetables.  The statement reflects the data accurately.

2. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs;  initiatives include the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee and the Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMP does aim to generate investment by monetising government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore, it is not managed entirely by the private sector.  The government plays a significant role in overseeing and regulating the process.  The statement incorrectly asserts complete private sector control, ignoring government involvement.

Statement 2 accurately describes the role of the Private Investment Unit and highlights key initiatives related to PPPs in India.  The Private Investment Unit's responsibility for policy-level matters is correctly stated, along with the mention of the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee and the VGF scheme.


**6. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Asset Monetization (AM) was first proposed by the Rangarajan Committee in 2008, and involves only the outright sale of government-owned assets to private entities for immediate revenue generation.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) identifies 13 sectors for monetizing brownfield infrastructure assets, with roads, railways, power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom being the top 5 sectors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Vijay Kelkar committee, not the Rangarajan Committee, first recommended AM in 2012. Furthermore, AM doesn't solely involve outright sales; it also includes licensing and leasing arrangements, allowing for balanced risk-sharing and long-term revenue streams.  The statement misrepresents both the origin and the methods of AM.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the NMP's scope and target sectors.  The identification of 13 sectors for monetizing brownfield infrastructure assets, with the top 5 sectors (roads, railways, power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom) capturing a significant portion of the pipeline, is correctly stated.


**7. With reference to the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India Stack, India's foundational DPI, comprises layers for identity (e.g., Aadhaar), payments (e.g., UPI), and data governance (e.g., DigiLocker), and it is entirely self-sufficient and does not collaborate with any international initiatives.
2. Initiatives for global DPI advancement include the One Future Alliance, the Global DPI Repository (GDPIR), and collaborations with the EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC), aimed at supporting DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India Stack forms the core of India's DPI, it is not entirely isolated from international collaborations.  The text mentions active participation in global initiatives to promote DPI adoption worldwide.  The statement falsely claims complete self-sufficiency and a lack of international partnerships.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the ongoing initiatives to advance DPI globally.  The One Future Alliance, the Global DPI Repository (GDPIR), and collaborations with the EU TTC are all correctly cited as examples of efforts to support DPI implementation in developing nations.


**8. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPI, launched in 2016, is a real-time payment system developed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and is currently limited to domestic transactions within India.
2. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), incorporated in 2008 by the RBI and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), is the umbrella organization operating retail payments and settlement systems in India, and it is responsible for developing and managing the UPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UPI was indeed launched in 2016 and is a real-time payment system, it is developed by the NPCI, not solely by the RBI.  Moreover, the text mentions that the UPI's reach is expanding internationally, contradicting the statement's claim of limitation to domestic transactions.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the NPCI's role in developing and managing the UPI.  The details regarding the NPCI's incorporation, its constituent members (RBI and IBA), and its function as an umbrella organization for retail payments and settlement systems are all accurate.


**9.  With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is not part of aquaculture; it's a distinct agricultural practice, and the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes negligibly to India's GDP.
2.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons per year by 2025, and initiatives include the development of a GIS-based portal to map seaweed cultivation sites.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While India's rank in the GII is different from its rank in the International IP Index, the theme of GII 2024 is "Unlocking the Promise of Social Entrepreneurship," not "Sustainable Development Goals."

Statement 2 correctly reflects India's improved GII ranking and the inclusion of Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai, and Mumbai among the top 100 S&T clusters.  This information is accurately presented in the text.


**12. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. This treaty, adopted by the World Trade Organization (WTO), aims to enhance the protection of intellectual property rights related to genetic resources and traditional knowledge by establishing stricter patent grant criteria.
2.  The treaty acknowledges the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and is legally binding upon all member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty was adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), not the World Trade Organization (WTO).  While it aims to enhance the protection of intellectual property related to genetic resources and traditional knowledge, the claim about stricter patent grant criteria is a broad generalization; the treaty's approach is more nuanced.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The treaty does acknowledge UNDRIP, but it's crucial to note that it will come into force only after ratification by 15 parties.  It is not automatically or immediately legally binding on all WIPO member states.  The statement misrepresents the treaty's legal status.


**1. With reference to India's agricultural policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform primarily focuses on collecting data related to farmer demographics, land ownership, and crop yields.
2.  The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism covers all major agricultural commodities produced in India, ensuring a guaranteed price for farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. ADeX indeed focuses on collecting data related to farmer identity, geotagged farm location, and crops sown. While it indirectly helps in yield estimation through crop sown data, its primary focus isn't directly on crop yields in the same way as KISAN, which uses space technology for yield estimation.  The statement accurately captures the core functionalities of ADeX.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MSP mechanism, while aiming to prevent distress selling, does not cover *all* major agricultural commodities.  It covers a specific list of 22 crops (14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops, plus Toria and de-husked coconut), leaving out numerous other agricultural products.  The statement overstates the comprehensiveness of the MSP scheme.  The implication that it guarantees a price for all farmers is also misleading, as MSP is a price floor, and not all farmers sell to the government at that price.  Market forces still play a significant role.  This makes the statement factually inaccurate and a strong distractor.


**2. With reference to agricultural technology adoption in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) uses solely artificial intelligence for informed decision-making in agriculture.
2. The Digital Agriculture Mission's Agri Stack primarily aims to provide farmers with access to credit and financial services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICCC utilizes a combination of technologies, including artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), for informed decision-making.  The statement falsely restricts the ICCC's technological base to only AI, thus misrepresenting the reality of its multi-faceted approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Digital Agriculture Mission aims to improve farmers' lives, the Agri Stack's core focus is on creating a farmer-centric digital public infrastructure (DPI) to streamline services and scheme delivery. This includes creating farmer IDs, geo-referenced village maps, and a crop sown registry.  The statement misrepresents the core purpose of the Agri Stack, focusing instead on a secondary or tangential benefit.  The question tests the understanding of the core functions of the Agri Stack, highlighting the nuances of digital agricultural initiatives.


**3. With reference to India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" technologies are designed to enhance livestock productivity by providing real-time health monitoring and disease prediction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the exact functionalities of "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" might not be publicly detailed to the level of "real-time health monitoring and disease prediction," their core purpose is to improve the genetic selection and disease management in cattle and buffaloes, respectively, thus contributing to productivity enhancement.  The statement presents a plausible, albeit slightly exaggerated, interpretation of the technology's aim.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The sustainable livestock health and production scheme, with its focus on improving animal health and productivity, primarily aims to address domestic challenges like high economic losses due to diseases and low productivity.  Export promotion might be a secondary or indirect outcome, but it is not the primary goal of the scheme.  The statement misdirects the candidate towards an inaccurate interpretation of the scheme's objectives, highlighting the importance of understanding the specific aims of government initiatives.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports in 2023-24 exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion set by the 2018 policy.
2.  Rice and marine products constitute the largest share of India's agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target. This directly contradicts the statement, making it a clear distractor.  The question highlights the importance of carefully reading and interpreting numerical data presented in policy analysis.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While the passage indicates that rice constitutes 21% of total exports and marine products 15%, it doesn't definitively state that these are the *largest* shares.  Other unnamed products could potentially hold a larger share. However, it's close enough to the truth to be considered correct within the context of the multiple-choice format where the other option is demonstrably false.  The question tests the ability to extract and interpret key data from a passage, while acknowledging potential ambiguities in the information provided.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Inheritance tax is levied on the value of assets inherited after a person's death, not on assets transferred during their lifetime. Estate tax, on the other hand, is levied on the total value of a deceased person's estate.  The distinction lies in the timing of the tax – inheritance tax applies upon inheritance, while estate tax applies upon death.  While both aim to address wealth inequality, their mechanisms differ significantly.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The estate duty in India, introduced in 1953, faced criticism due to its high tax rates, which reached up to 85%, significantly impacting investment and savings. This unpopularity led to its eventual abolition in 1985. The claim of  "exceeding 75%" is a close approximation to the actual rate, making it a plausible distractor, but the core reason for abolition remains accurate.  The high tax burden discouraged wealth accumulation and investment, contributing to its unpopularity.


**2. With reference to tax policies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The reintroduction of gift tax in 2004 aimed to curb tax evasion and reduce wealth inequality by taxing gifts exceeding a specified threshold, currently set at ₹200,000.
2.  The World Inequality Lab's study indicates that India's wealth inequality has consistently decreased since independence, with the top 1% holding less than 30% of the total wealth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While gift tax was indeed reintroduced in 2004, the threshold for taxable gifts was ₹50,000, not ₹200,000. The statement attempts to mislead by altering a key numerical detail. The primary goal of gift tax is to prevent tax evasion through the transfer of assets as gifts to avoid inheritance or other taxes, but its effectiveness in significantly reducing wealth inequality remains debatable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Inequality Lab's study shows a contrasting trend.  It highlights that wealth inequality in India has increased since the 1980s and accelerated in the 2000s, with the top 1% controlling over 40% of total wealth. The statement reverses the actual trend, presenting a deceptive picture of decreasing inequality. This showcases a significant distortion of factual data to create a misleading statement.


**3. With reference to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) recorded its highest number of APA signings in FY 2022-23, exceeding 100 agreements, including both unilateral and bilateral APAs.
2. APAs primarily aim to mitigate transfer pricing disputes between multinational companies and tax authorities by pre-determining the appropriate transfer pricing methodology.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MSP aims to provide a safety net for farmers, the government doesn't guarantee the purchase of *all* produce offered at the MSP.  Procurement is usually done by government agencies like the Food Corporation of India (FCI), but the quantity procured depends on factors like storage capacity, market demand, and budgetary allocations.  It’s a price floor, not a guaranteed purchase agreement for unlimited quantities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CACP recommends MSPs based on production costs, but the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  This indicates a multi-layered decision-making process involving various stakeholders and economic considerations beyond the CACP's recommendations.  The CCEA's role ensures that the MSP policy aligns with broader economic goals and government fiscal capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PACS can play a role in facilitating access to credit, they are not merely intermediaries. They are independent cooperative societies that directly provide credit services to their members.  They are not simply channeling funds from commercial banks; they manage their own funds and lending operations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly describes PACS as cooperative societies that operate on the principle of mutual benefit among their members, with a specified minimum membership requirement.  This cooperative structure is a key characteristic of PACS and distinguishes them from other financial institutions.  The emphasis on membership highlights their role in strengthening rural communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Human Development Report (HDR) 2023-2024 is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank.  The statement misattributes the releasing agency.  The report does indeed highlight the "Democracy Paradox."

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's HDI value did increase, but its rank *improved* in 2022 compared to 2021 (moving from 135 to 134). The statement incorrectly claims that the rank remained unchanged.


**5. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NICDP envisages the development of 11 industrial corridors with 32 projects to be developed in *four*, not five phases. The statement misstates the number of phases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor was the first approved,  it is not the only completed project, and it's not fully completed.  Other projects under the NICDP are also under various stages of development and completion. The statement incorrectly implies that only one project is completed.


**7. With reference to the  "crowding out" effect in economics, consider the following statements:**

1. The "crowding out" effect refers to a situation where increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, thereby reducing private sector investment.
2.  "Crowding out" is primarily caused by decreased government spending, leading to lower aggregate demand and reduced private sector investment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "crowding out" effect accurately describes the scenario where increased government spending (often financed through borrowing) leads to higher interest rates. This makes borrowing more expensive for private businesses, thus reducing their investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  "Crowding out" is caused by *increased*, not decreased, government spending (particularly when financed through borrowing).  Decreased government spending would likely have the opposite effect, potentially stimulating private investment. The statement incorrectly describes the cause of the effect.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The JCI's establishment in 1971 was indeed aimed at providing price support to jute farmers, mitigating the risks associated with fluctuating market prices and distress sales.  This is a crucial aspect of government intervention in agricultural markets.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Jute I-CARE project is a significant initiative of JCI focusing on mechanization in jute farming to enhance productivity and efficiency.  The project also emphasizes the use of microbial consortium for accelerated retting, a critical step in jute processing, thereby improving the quality of the final product and reducing environmental impact.  This aligns with the government's focus on sustainable agricultural practices.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the roles and functions of JCI.


**2. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, primarily focuses on assessing the level of access to formal financial services among the rural poor, excluding other aspects of their livelihoods.
2. The NAFINDEX, a key metric derived from NAFIS data, exclusively measures the penetration of digital financial services in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NAFIS does assess access to financial services (loans, insurance, pensions), it also offers a comprehensive overview of rural livelihoods.  It’s a broader survey than just financial inclusion, encompassing various aspects of the rural population's economic status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NAFINDEX, based on NAFIS data, measures overall financial inclusion, encompassing a wider range of financial services than just digital ones.  It provides a holistic picture of financial access in rural areas, including traditional financial instruments.  Therefore, both statements present an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of NAFIS and NAFINDEX.


**3. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS operate independently of the cooperative credit structure and are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing financial support to PACS, acting as a critical link in the rural credit system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are indeed the grassroots level of the short-term cooperative credit structure.  However, they are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies, not directly under the RBI.  The RBI's regulatory purview extends to other cooperative banks but not directly to PACS.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs are a crucial component of the rural credit system. One of their main functions is to channel funds to PACS, facilitating the flow of credit to farmers at the village level. This highlights the interconnectedness of the cooperative credit structure in rural India.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) solely focuses on disparities in educational attainment between men and women.
2. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) measures the loss in overall HDI due to inequality across various dimensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII considers gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity (labor market participation). It is not limited to just educational disparities.

Statement 2 is correct.  The IHDI directly addresses the impact of inequality on the overall HDI. It quantifies the reduction in the HDI value resulting from disparities in health, education, and income. It shows what the HDI would be if there were no inequalities in these dimensions.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the functions of the relevant index.


**5. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The MPI, published annually by the World Bank, exclusively uses income as a criterion for measuring poverty.
2.  The MPI considers deprivations across various dimensions, including health, education, and living standards, to determine multidimensional poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MPI, jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI, is a multidimensional poverty measure that goes beyond income. It considers various dimensions of poverty, not just income levels.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MPI's core strength lies in its multidimensional approach, incorporating indicators related to health, education, and living standards to provide a more comprehensive understanding of poverty than solely income-based measures.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

This ensures coordinated planning and efficient resource allocation. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of individual PPP projects.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects to assess their viability and potential risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs focuses on policy-level matters concerning PPPs, not the direct implementation and monitoring of individual projects.  Implementation and monitoring are handled at the project level by various agencies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a critical role in evaluating central sector PPP projects, ensuring that they meet certain standards of financial viability and risk mitigation.  This committee's assessment is crucial before projects proceed. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first proposed the concept of asset monetization in the Union Budget of 2021-22.
2. Asset monetization primarily involves the outright sale of government-owned assets to private entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Union Budget 2021-22 announced the National Monetization Pipeline, the concept of asset monetization was first recommended by the Vijay Kelkar Committee much earlier, in 2012.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Asset monetization doesn't necessarily involve outright sales.  It encompasses various models, including licensing, leasing, and concessions, where the government retains some ownership or control while generating revenue from the asset's utilization.  Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies.


**9. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF exclusively provides grants to farmers for the creation of individual-level agricultural infrastructure.
2. The AIF aims to enhance agricultural infrastructure by providing loans with interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF doesn't only provide grants for individual-level infrastructure; it also supports the creation of community-level infrastructure through viable projects. It offers broader support than just individual farmers.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the AIF is its provision of loans with interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage under schemes like CGTMSE and NAB Sanrakshan, thereby making it more accessible to farmers and farmer groups. This is a crucial aspect of its design.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**10. With reference to India's initiatives for Agritech adoption, consider the following statements:**

1. The FASAL project primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of post-harvest loss estimation using remote sensing data.
2.  The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform is designed to facilitate the sharing of farmer-related data among various stakeholders in the agriculture sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FASAL project is about providing early forecasts of crop output using space, agro-meteorology and land-based observations. It is not primarily focused on post-harvest loss estimation.

Statement 2 is correct. ADeX is designed as a data exchange platform to facilitate the sharing of crucial farmer-related data, promoting better coordination and informed decision-making within the agricultural ecosystem. This facilitates better service delivery and improved outcomes for farmers. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) determines the MSPs based solely on the market prices of the respective crops.
2.  MSPs are announced at the beginning of the sowing season to provide farmers with price certainty before they begin cultivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CACP considers various factors beyond market prices when recommending MSPs, including production costs (A2, A2+FL, C2), ensuring a reasonable return to farmers, and maintaining price stability in the market. Market prices are only one factor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The timely announcement of MSPs at the beginning of the sowing season is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions about their cropping patterns, providing them with price certainty and reducing the risk of distress sales.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. With reference to India’s Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agricultural Export Policy of 2018 aimed to increase agricultural exports to $60 billion by 2022 and has successfully achieved this target.
2.  Agricultural exports and imports in India have consistently increased every year since the implementation of the 2018 policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 2018 policy aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, this target was not achieved.  The policy faced challenges in meeting its ambitious goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Agricultural exports and imports haven't consistently increased every year since the policy’s implementation.  There have been fluctuations and even declines in certain years, influenced by various factors such as global market conditions and domestic production levels. Therefore, both statements are inaccurate.


**13. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) and its Indian counterpart (NMPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMPI, introduced in 2021, uses data exclusively from the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) for its calculations.
2. The global MPI and the NMPI both incorporate indicators related to health, education, and living standards to assess multidimensional poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMPI utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the SECC.  The data source is a crucial distinction between the two.

Statement 2 is correct.  Both the global MPI and the NMPI share a common framework, incorporating indicators related to health, education, and living standards to comprehensively assess multidimensional poverty. This is a key similarity in their methodologies.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**14. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to rate bank loans and facilities.
2. SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating methodologies, but not their default recognition policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While several CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI, not all are.  There is a difference between SEBI registration and RBI accreditation for rating bank loans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI regulations require CRAs to disclose both their rating methodologies and their default recognition policies, among other crucial information, to ensure transparency and accountability in their operations.  Both are mandatory disclosures. Therefore, both statements are inaccurate.


**15. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are exclusively designed for investing in government-owned infrastructure projects, excluding private sector projects.
2.  The SEBI regulations for InvITs allow for the issuance of subordinate units by privately placed InvITs to sponsors for acquiring infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs are not limited to government-owned projects; they can invest in both public and private sector infrastructure projects.  This is a key feature of their flexibility.

Statement 2 is correct.  Recent amendments to SEBI regulations do allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors, facilitating the acquisition of infrastructure projects. This addresses potential valuation discrepancies between sponsors and InvITs.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**16. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI initiates PCA for UCBs solely based on their capital adequacy ratios, ignoring other financial parameters.
2.  A UCB exits the PCA framework only after it maintains compliance with risk thresholds for at least two consecutive quarterly financial statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's PCA framework for UCBs considers multiple financial parameters, including capital adequacy, asset quality, profitability, and other risk indicators. It's not solely based on capital adequacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A UCB exits PCA only after it shows consistent compliance with risk thresholds for four consecutive quarterly financial statements, not just two.  This ensures sustained financial health before restrictions are lifted.  Therefore, both statements are inaccurate.


**17. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All loans provided by Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) are classified as microfinance loans by the RBI, irrespective of the loan amount or the borrower's income.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides loans to microfinance institutions to further lend to individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's definition of microfinance loans considers both the loan amount (up to ₹3,00,000) and the borrower's annual income (up to ₹3,00,000).  Loans exceeding these limits are not classified as microfinance loans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans directly to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises through various financial institutions, not exclusively to MFIs.  MFIs can certainly benefit from PMMY, but it's not their sole source of funding.  Therefore, both statements are inaccurate.



**1. With reference to deep-sea mining in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable offshore mineral resources, including polymetallic nodules rich in manganese and iron, but lacks economically viable deposits of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.
2.  The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, utilize a modified version of the United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC) and Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) Template for Exploration Stages, mandating rigorous exploration standards for all minerals, including hydrocarbons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  India's EEZ does indeed possess substantial offshore mineral resources, with polymetallic nodules being a key focus.  These nodules are known to contain high concentrations of manganese and iron. However, the statement incorrectly implies a complete lack of economically viable cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts. While the text doesn't explicitly state their abundance, it mentions their presence in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, suggesting potential economic viability is under investigation or remains uncertain.  The emphasis on the presence of manganese and iron-rich nodules in Statement 1, while technically true, subtly misdirects from the nuanced reality about cobalt-rich crusts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils and hydrocarbons from their applicability.  The rules do adopt a modified UNFC and CRIRSCO framework, and mandate rigorous exploration standards, but this is limited to minerals *other* than those specified in the exclusion. This crucial detail is omitted in Statement 2, making it a misleading distractor. The inclusion of "including hydrocarbons" creates a false positive, leading the candidate to incorrectly believe the statement is accurate.


**2. With reference to India's steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's per capita finished steel consumption significantly lags behind global averages, primarily due to low energy costs and high domestic production of coking coal.
2.  The Indian steel industry faces challenges related to carbon taxes imposed by the European Union (EU) which are not significant enough to threaten major iron and steel exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India's per capita steel consumption is indeed lower than global averages, the reasons cited are inaccurate. The text highlights high import costs for coking coal as a major challenge, contradicting the statement's claim of high domestic production.  Furthermore, energy costs are not mentioned as a factor contributing to low consumption; rather, the text points towards the steel industry being extremely energy-intensive, which is a challenge in itself. The statement attempts to create confusion by inverting a real challenge (high import costs for coking coal) and presenting it as a strength.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India's major iron and steel exports to the EU *will* face a threat due to the imposition of carbon taxes ranging from 19.8% to 52.7%. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion that the carbon taxes are insignificant.  The statement tries to downplay the severity of the problem, presenting a false sense of security.  The wide range of potential tax implications (19.8% to 52.7%) is also deliberately omitted, making the statement even more misleading.


**3.  With reference to seaweed farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation is considered a part of aquaculture, a sector contributing significantly to India's GDP, exceeding 5% of the national economic output.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025 through the promotion of integrated aquaparks and the deployment of advanced technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seaweed cultivation is indeed part of aquaculture, the text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes only 1.5% to India's GDP, significantly less than the 5% claimed in the statement. The statement inflates the economic contribution of the sector to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) explicitly aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons per year by 2025.  The program also promotes the use of integrated aquaparks and advanced technologies like RAS and Biofloc.  The statement accurately reflects the stated objectives of PMMSY.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism covers 20 Kharif crops, including paddy, cotton, and sugarcane, but excludes commercial crops like jute and copra.
2.  India's agricultural export policy, aiming for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, has successfully achieved its target and continues to show robust growth in export earnings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the MSP covers 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (jute and copra), totaling 22 crops. The statement incorrectly reduces the number of Kharif crops and excludes the explicitly mentioned commercial crops.  The numbers are intentionally altered to create confusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set for 2022.  The statement presents a completely opposite picture of the situation, offering a false claim of success.  This is a clear attempt to mislead the candidate by presenting a fabricated positive outcome.


**5. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) project, implemented by DFCCIL, aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 45% in 2019 to 27% by 2030.
2.  The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) with Russia will allow the Indian military to access logistics and support facilities at Russian bases and ports, but excludes access during wartime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the DFC project aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% (in 2019) to 45% (by 2030).  The statement reverses the initial and target percentages, creating a false narrative.  This is a clear example of manipulating numerical data to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the RELOS agreement will facilitate access to logistics and support facilities during *both* wartime and peacetime missions.  The statement falsely restricts access to peacetime only, introducing a significant inaccuracy.  The deliberate omission of the "wartime" clause is designed to deceive the candidate.


**6. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and related indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures inequalities in reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation, and India's ranking has consistently improved in recent years, showing a significant reduction in gender disparities.
2. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the HDI for planetary pressures, reflecting concerns about intergenerational equity, and India's IHDI value is significantly higher than its HDI value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the GII does measure inequalities across the mentioned dimensions, the statement incorrectly claims consistent improvement and significant reduction in gender disparities.  The text only shows a jump of 14 places in 2022, not necessarily reflecting a consistent trend or significant reduction.  The statement oversimplifies the complex reality of India's gender inequality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IHDI *does not* adjust for planetary pressures.  That adjustment is done by the Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index. The statement confuses the two indices.  Furthermore, the text indicates that India's IHDI rank is *lower* than its HDI rank (140th vs. an unstated but higher HDI rank), implying a lower IHDI value, not higher as claimed.  The statement incorrectly conflates the IHDI with another index and misrepresents the relative values.


**1. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) project aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic from its 2019 level to 45% by 2030, as per the National Rail Plan 2030.
2.  The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) is a flagship initiative under the Bharatmala Pariyojana, focusing solely on road infrastructure improvements to enhance logistics efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), a crucial component of the National Rail Plan 2030, indeed aim to significantly boost the share of rail freight in India's overall freight transport.  The plan targets an increase from 27% in 2019 to 45% by 2030.  DFCCIL, a special purpose vehicle under Indian Railways, plays a pivotal role in the planning, development, and operation of these corridors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both LEEP and Bharatmala Pariyojana contribute to improving logistics efficiency, LEEP is a separate program focused on improving freight transport efficiency across various modes, not solely limited to road infrastructure under Bharatmala. Bharatmala Pariyojana's primary focus is on the construction of national highways, although improved road infrastructure indirectly benefits overall logistics efficiency.  LEEP's scope is broader and encompasses measures beyond just road improvements.  The linkage presented in the statement is inaccurate.


**2. With reference to India's port sector and related initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vadhavan Port, once operational, will be India's largest container port and will surpass all existing major ports in terms of cargo handling capacity.
2. The Harit Shrey scheme, implemented by Mormugao Port Authority, incentivizes ships based on their Environmental Ship Index (ESI) scores, aiming to promote green shipping and reduce carbon emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Vadhvan Port is projected to be one of India's largest deep-water ports and a significant container port, claiming it will surpass *all* existing major ports in cargo handling capacity is an overstatement.  The existing major ports have established infrastructure and operational capabilities.  The statement presents an overly definitive and potentially inaccurate projection.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mormugao Port Authority's Harit Shrey scheme is a genuine initiative designed to incentivize ships with favorable ESI scores, thereby promoting greener shipping practices. This aligns with global efforts to decarbonize the maritime sector and reduces the environmental impact of shipping activities. The scheme's objective and implementation are accurately described.


**3. With reference to India's efforts in seaweed farming, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation, as part of aquaculture, currently contributes more than 5% to India's GDP.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The fishing and aquaculture sector's contribution to India's GDP is stated as 1.5%, not more than 5%. While seaweed farming is a growing segment within aquaculture, its current contribution to the overall GDP is significantly smaller than what the statement suggests.  This is a clear numerical error creating a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has explicitly set a target of achieving 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025. This reflects a significant ambition to expand seaweed cultivation in India and harness its economic and environmental benefits. The statement accurately reflects the Yojana's objectives.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding India's silk production:**

1. India is the world's largest producer of silk, accounting for over 50% of global production.
2. Karnataka is the leading silk-producing state in India, contributing more than 40% of the nation's total silk output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India is the *second* largest producer of silk globally, not the largest.  The provided data indicates that India accounts for approximately 42% of global silk production in 2023.  This is a significant share but not the majority.  The statement misrepresents India's position in the global silk market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka is a major silk producer, it contributes around 32% of India's total silk production, not more than 40%. Andhra Pradesh holds the second position.  The statement overestimates Karnataka's share of India's silk production.


**5. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources and regulations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons, found in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
2.  The rules mandate the use of the modified United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC) and Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) Template for exploration stage classifications and feasibility studies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's share of agricultural exports and imports in 2022 were indeed 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, according to the WTO's Trade Statistical Review, 2023,  its ranking among global agricultural exporters was 9th, not 7th.  The precise ranking is important for understanding its position in the global market.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) aims to improve infrastructure related to exports, but it also indirectly supports domestic consumption because better infrastructure benefits both domestic and export markets. However, the primary goal of TIES is to enhance the infrastructure needed for efficient export operations.  The statement's phrasing is slightly misleading by emphasizing domestic consumption over the export focus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the AIF does offer a 3% per annum interest subvention, it's not limited to *only* post-harvest management infrastructure.  The scheme has expanded to include integrated primary and secondary processing projects and allows convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for various eligible beneficiaries. The restriction to rural areas is also incorrect; the scheme's scope is broader.

Statement 2 is correct.  The credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE (and now also NAB Sanrakshan for FPOs) is specifically for loans up to ₹2 Crores.  Loans exceeding this amount do not receive this credit guarantee.  This crucial detail makes statement 2 accurate.  The question attempts to mislead by suggesting that *no* credit guarantee exists for larger loans, whereas the reality is that the guarantee scheme has a specific upper limit.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP):**

1. The PMGS NMP utilizes a proprietary, closed-source technology platform developed specifically for this initiative, ensuring data security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in India registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, directly contradicting the assertion of consistent substantial growth. The ambitious target set by the 2018 policy was also not met.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice is a significant export commodity,  the text indicates it constitutes 21% of total exports, far less than the 50% claimed.  This demonstrates a factual inaccuracy in the statement. The question uses a plausible but incorrect figure to create a distractor.


**5. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The revised PSL norms introduce a uniform weighting system across all districts, irrespective of their credit flow.
2.  All bank loans to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) automatically qualify for classification under PSL.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised PSL norms *do not* introduce a uniform weighting system.  Instead, they create a differentiated incentive and disincentive framework based on the credit flow in different districts.  Districts with lower credit flow receive higher weighting, while those with high loan availability receive lower weighting. This directly contradicts the statement's claim of uniformity.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that "All bank loans to MSMEs shall qualify for classification under PSL," making this statement factually accurate. The question aims to mislead by focusing on the complexities of the district-based weighting system in statement 1.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1.  The global MPI identifies individuals as "MPI poor" if they are deprived in at least half of the weighted indicators.
2. The Indian National MPI (NMPI) incorporates the same indicators as the global MPI, without any additions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that a person is identified as "MPI poor" if deprived of 1/3rd or more (not half) of the weighted indicators.  This numerical difference is a critical detail that makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian NMPI includes two additional indicators—Maternal Health and Bank Account—beyond those in the global MPI model.  The omission of this key difference makes the statement factually wrong. The question plays on the similarity between the global and national MPI to create a distractor.


**7. With reference to the  "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector," consider the following statements:**

1. The plan is solely implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW).
2.  The initiative only provides storage facilities at the PACS level, without support for other related agricultural infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The plan is implemented by the Ministry of Cooperation (MoC), not the MoA&FW. This difference in the implementing ministry is a key fact that makes the statement wrong.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The initiative provides support not just for storage facilities but also for other agricultural infrastructure at the PACS level, such as warehouses, custom hiring centers, and processing units. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the plan.  The inclusion of "alongside other agricultural infrastructure" in the description is crucial but easily missed.


**8. With reference to the  FASAL Project, consider the following statements:**

1. The FASAL project primarily utilizes data from weather stations and traditional agricultural surveys to forecast crop output.
2. The project was initiated in 2020 to address the growing need for accurate and timely crop yield predictions in the face of climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FASAL project utilizes a much broader range of data than just weather stations and traditional surveys. It leverages space, agro-meteorology, and land-based observations for more comprehensive forecasting. This broader data integration is a core element of the project's methodology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that the FASAL project was started in 2005, not 2020.  The starting year is a significant detail that makes the statement inaccurate.  The question attempts to mislead by focusing on the contemporary relevance of accurate crop yield prediction.


**9. With reference to the  KISAN project, consider the following statements:**

1. The KISAN project's primary goal is to improve the accuracy of crop insurance assessments by leveraging advanced space technology and geospatial data.
2. The project is implemented independently of other government initiatives related to agricultural data management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description clearly indicates that KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics to enhance yield estimation for crop insurance purposes. This is the project's core objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The KISAN project is clearly part of a broader ecosystem of agricultural data management initiatives. It interacts with other systems and data sets, as evident from its relationship with the Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX). The question tries to create a false impression of the project's isolation.


**10. With reference to the  "Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies" report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report was published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
2. The report focuses solely on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in precision agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report was published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the FAO. This difference in the publishing entity is a critical detail that makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the report acknowledges the role of AI, it covers a broader range of agritech applications across four categories: intelligent crop planning, smart farming, farmgate-to-fork, and data as an enabler.  The statement incorrectly limits the report's scope to only AI in precision agriculture.  The question uses a narrow interpretation of the report's focus to create a distractor.


**1. With reference to the Digital Agriculture Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission's Agri Stack component aims to create digital identities for all farmers in India within two years, primarily using data from the National Sample Survey.
2. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS to provide real-time information on crop conditions and weather patterns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Digital Agriculture Mission's Agri Stack does aim to create digital identities for farmers, the target is 11 crore farmers over three years, not all farmers within two years.  The statement also incorrectly attributes the data source solely to the National Sample Survey;  the Farmer's Registry component of Agri Stack utilizes various sources beyond the NSS.

Statement 2 is correct. The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) explicitly leverages data from RISAT-1A (a radar imaging satellite) and VEDAS (Visualization of Earth observation Data and Archival System) to provide the real-time agricultural information mentioned. This integration of remote sensing technology is a core feature of the DSS.  The use of satellite imagery for agricultural monitoring is a crucial element of the Digital Agriculture Mission, enhancing precision farming capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that the average annual productivity of cattle in India (1777 kg/animal/year) is *lower* than the world average (2699 kg/animal/year). The Rashtriya Gokul Mission aims to improve productivity, but it hasn't yet achieved surpassing the global average.  The statement misrepresents the current state of cattle productivity in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are unified genomic chips for cattle and buffalo, respectively.  Their primary aim is to improve animal breeding and genetic selection, not directly to address antimicrobial resistance. While improved breeding practices might indirectly contribute to reducing antibiotic use in the long run by improving animal health, this is not the direct objective of the chip initiatives. The focus is on enhancing genetic traits and productivity.


**3. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The AIF provides short-term loans to individual farmers for purchasing agricultural machinery, with a 5% interest subvention.
2.  The recent expansion of the AIF includes allowing convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for farmer groups and cooperatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF offers *medium- to long-term* debt financing, not short-term loans.  The focus is on investment in post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets. The interest subvention is 3%, not 5%. The statement incorrectly characterizes the loan duration and the interest rate offered under the scheme.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions the recent expansion of the AIF to include convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for farmer/group of farmers/Farmer Producer Organizations/Cooperatives/Panchayats. This expansion aims to broaden the scheme's reach and impact. The convergence with other schemes reflects a strategy to create synergies and enhance the effectiveness of agricultural development initiatives.



**4. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report ranked India's PPP regulatory landscape among the top 10 globally.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions a World Bank report analyzing PPP regulatory landscapes across 140 economies, but it does not provide India's ranking.  The absence of specific ranking information makes the statement incorrect.  It is crucial to note that the mere mention of a report doesn't automatically imply a positive assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects, not solely state-level ones. The committee's purview is specifically limited to projects at the national level, as indicated by the term "central sector."  The statement misrepresents the committee's area of responsibility.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the White Revolution 2.0:**

1. The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) released by the Ministry of Cooperatives aim to reduce milk production and increase the import of dairy products.
2. Dr. Verghese Kurien, the architect of India's original White Revolution, is commemorated annually on November 26th as National Milk Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The purpose of White Revolution 2.0, as implied by its name and the mention of SOPs, is to *strengthen* the dairy sector and improve its efficiency, not to reduce milk production or increase imports. The statement presents a contradictory objective.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that November 26th is observed as National Milk Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Dr. Verghese Kurien, the driving force behind the original White Revolution.  This factual detail is directly supported by the provided information.  The date and the person's contribution to the dairy sector are correctly linked.


**6. With reference to the  National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NADCP aims to control and eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis within five years of its launch, irrespective of geographical location.
2. The program utilizes indigenous sex-sorted technology to reduce costs associated with producing female calves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NADCP aims to control and eradicate FMD and Brucellosis, the timeframe for achieving this goal is not explicitly stated as five years.  The statement adds a specific, unsupported timeframe.  Eradication programs are complex and their success is contingent on various factors including effective implementation, resource availability and disease dynamics which vary geographically.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the NADCP incorporates indigenous sex-sorted technology to increase the availability of sex-sorted semen for farmers at a reduced cost, thereby facilitating the production of only female calves. This is a key component of the program, directly improving livestock management and economics.


**7. With reference to  Co-lending in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates that banks must bear at least 80% of the credit risk in co-lending arrangements with Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs).
2. Banks are prohibited from entering into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs that belong to their promoter group.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI guidelines stipulate that in co-lending arrangements, NBFCs bear a minimum of 20% of the credit risk, implying that banks bear at least 80%.  This risk-sharing mechanism is a core element of the co-lending framework. This ensures that both partners share the financial burden and risk associated with the loan.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text specifically states that banks are not allowed to engage in co-lending with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction aims to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of the lending process.  This rule helps maintain transparency and prevent potential abuse of the co-lending model.


**8. With reference to the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), consider the following statements:**

1. KVKs are primarily funded by individual state governments, with supplementary funding from the central government.
2. The first KVK was established in 1974 in Puducherry under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly indicates that KVKs are 100% financed by the central government, not a shared funding model between states and the center. The statement presents an inaccurate funding model for KVKs.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the first KVK was established in 1974 in Puducherry, under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. This detail accurately reflects the historical development of the KVK network.  The location and the affiliating university are correctly identified.


**9. With reference to the  Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999, consider the following statements:**

1. The GI Act grants individual rights to farmers over their traditional knowledge related to specific agricultural products.
2. UNESCO recognition of Yoga as Intangible Cultural Heritage is directly governed by the GI Act, 1999.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GI Act grants *collective* rights to groups or communities over traditional knowledge associated with specific products, not individual rights to farmers. The statement misrepresents the nature of the rights granted under the Act.  Collective ownership is key to protecting traditional knowledge associated with a geographical region.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While both the GI Act and UNESCO recognition relate to the protection of intangible cultural heritage, they are distinct legal and institutional frameworks.  UNESCO recognition operates under international conventions, separate from the Indian domestic GI Act.  The statement incorrectly links two unrelated legal frameworks.


**10. With reference to the  PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMGS NMP adopts a multi-modal approach, encompassing seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  The statement erroneously presents a limited scope for the plan, ignoring its multi-modal nature.  A holistic approach to infrastructure development is central to PMGS NMP.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the Digital Master Planning tool used in PMGS NMP is built on open-source technology and hosted on Meghraj, the Government of India's cloud platform. This technological foundation is a key feature of the plan, enabling efficient data management and integration.  Open-source technology promotes transparency and collaboration.


**11. With reference to the  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).
2. The NMP exclusively focuses on monetising assets in the infrastructure sector, excluding other government assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the NMP's objective and target amount for investment generation through asset monetization over the specified period.  The statement correctly reflects the financial goals and timeframe of the NMP.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the NMP likely includes a significant portion of infrastructure assets, it does not *exclusively* focus on this sector.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of assets included in the NMP.  The monetization strategy can encompass a broader range of government-owned assets to maximize revenue generation.


**12. With reference to the  Revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks, consider the following statements:**

1. The revised norms mandate that co-operative banks must allocate net profits to the Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) before complying with other regulations.
2. The revised norms apply only to Urban Co-operative Banks, excluding State and Central Co-operative Banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised norms require co-operative banks to charge provisions for BDDR as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account *before* allocating net profits. The statement incorrectly reverses the order of these financial actions.  Charging provisions as an expense is a crucial aspect of sound financial management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the revised norms apply to Urban, State, and Central co-operative banks. The statement incorrectly excludes State and Central Co-operative Banks from the scope of the revised norms.  A comprehensive approach to regulating co-operative banks is evident in the application of the revised norms.


**13. With reference to the  Pandemic Fund Project, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pandemic Fund Project is a $15 million initiative funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund, established under India's G20 Presidency.

2. The portal facilitates access to various social security schemes implemented by different ministries, including the PM Suraksha Bima Yojana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The E-shram portal specifically targets *unorganized* workers, not those in the organized sector.  The statement misrepresents the target beneficiaries of the portal.  The focus on unorganized workers reflects the need to extend social security coverage to a largely underserved population.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the E-shram portal aims to facilitate access to various social security schemes, including the PM Suraksha Bima Yojana.  This is a core function of the portal, connecting unorganized workers with available benefits.  The integration of multiple schemes is essential for comprehensive social security coverage.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the  Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark:**

1. The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India, irrespective of their category or usage.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) develops and implements the ISI mark scheme under the BIS Act, 2016.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is mandatory only for *certain* products specified by the government through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), not for all products sold in India. The statement presents an overly broad application of the ISI mark requirement.  The selective application reflects a risk-based approach to product regulation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately identifies the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) as the developer and implementer of the ISI mark scheme, operating under the BIS Act, 2016.  This factual detail correctly describes the institutional context of the ISI mark.  The BIS Act provides the legal framework for standardization and quality control.


**16. With reference to the  National CoE for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE will be established as a private limited company under the Companies Act, 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE will be set up as a Section 8 company, not a private limited company, under the Companies Act, 2013.  The statement misidentifies the type of company being established.  Section 8 companies are non-profit organizations, reflecting the NCoE's developmental objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the provisional name for the NCoE is the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).  This detail accurately reflects the current naming convention for the organization.  The provisional nature of the name suggests the possibility of future changes.

1. DBN was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas.
2. DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded through a Universal Access Levy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. DBN was established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, not the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  The statement misidentifies the legal basis for the establishment of DBN.  The newer act reflects the updated regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that DBN replaced the USOF, which was indeed funded through a Universal Access Levy charged on licensees.  The statement correctly describes the relationship between DBN and USOF, including the funding mechanism for the latter.  The replacement reflects a shift in the policy approach to funding telecom schemes.


**18. With reference to the  Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership dedicated to assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in using trade for economic growth.
2. The EIF Trust Fund Manager is the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the EIF as a *multilateral* partnership (not bilateral) dedicated to assisting LDCs in using trade for growth and poverty reduction. The statement correctly identifies the EIF's purpose and beneficiary group.  Multilateral cooperation is central to the EIF's approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the WTO. The statement misidentifies the trust fund manager.  UNOPS' role reflects the involvement of international organizations in supporting the EIF's objectives.

1.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by ISRO, leveraging satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.
2.  The plan integrates projects from various ministries, including Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN, but excludes inland waterways projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan does utilize a Digital Master Planning tool and integrates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps, the tool was developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics), not directly by ISRO.  ISRO provides the data, but BISAG-N develops and maintains the tool. This subtle difference is crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan explicitly integrates projects related to inland waterways, alongside Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN.  The omission of inland waterways in the statement is a deliberate distractor.  The comprehensive nature of the plan aims to encompass all major logistical infrastructure components.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates all PPP projects, both at the central and state levels.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over a period of five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects.  It does not have jurisdiction over state-level PPP projects, which are appraised through different state-specific mechanisms.  The statement's broad generalization is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) targets ₹6.0 lakh crore over *four* years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  This seemingly minor numerical difference is a common type of distractor used in UPSC-style questions.  Precision in factual recall is essential.


**3. With reference to India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSP covers 24 crops, including all major Kharif and Rabi crops, and two commercial crops (jute and copra), along with Toria and de-husked coconut.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any government oversight or final decision-making process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the MSP does cover a wide range of crops, including the ones mentioned, the total number is 22, not 24. The inclusion of Toria and de-husked coconut is based on the MSPs of related crops (rapeseed & mustard, and copra respectively) and are not separate MSP-determined crops. The inflated number is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends the MSP based on production costs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  The statement wrongly suggests complete autonomy for the CACP, ignoring the crucial role of the government in the final MSP determination.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2023.
2. Agricultural exports in India witnessed a significant increase in 2023-24, surpassing the target set by the 2018 policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was for $60 billion by 2022, not 2023. The one-year difference is a common tactic to test accurate recall.

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While UPI is a real-time mobile payment system launched in 2016 and facilitates peer-to-peer and merchant payments, it was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  The RBI plays a regulatory role.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NPCI is not solely owned and operated by a consortium of private banks. It was incorporated in 2008 by the RBI and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) under the Payment and Settlements Systems Act, 2007.  It's an umbrella organization for retail payment systems in India, not a private entity.

2.  The WTO's dispute settlement mechanism allows member states to challenge trade policies deemed inconsistent with WTO rules, but the decisions of the dispute settlement body are not legally binding on member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Marrakesh Agreement did establish the WTO, replacing GATT, but it significantly expanded the scope of trade regulation to include trade in services, intellectual property rights, and other areas beyond just tariffs on goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While member states can challenge trade policies, the decisions of the WTO's dispute settlement body are legally binding on the member states involved in the dispute.  Non-compliance can lead to further action and trade sanctions.

1.  From India's independence until economic liberalization, GFCF consistently remained above 20% of GDP, indicating a high level of investment.
2.  The period from 2011-12 onwards witnessed a steady increase in private investment, as measured by GFCF, reflecting strong economic growth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

1. A windfall tax is a temporary levy imposed on businesses that experience unexpectedly high profits due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden surge in global commodity prices.
2. The primary objective of a windfall tax is to generate revenue for general government expenditure, rather than targeted social programs or infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A windfall tax is a temporary tax, often imposed when companies experience extraordinary profits due to unexpected events beyond their direct control (e.g., a sharp rise in oil prices).  It's designed to capture some of these excess profits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While revenue generation is a consequence of windfall taxes, their purpose often extends beyond general government spending. Governments may use the revenue to fund specific social programs, infrastructure projects, or to mitigate the negative impacts of the events leading to the windfall profits.  The allocation of funds is often policy-driven and targeted.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NAFIS provides a comprehensive overview, the passage states it was launched in 2016-17, and the provided text doesn't specify a five-year interval for the survey. The question alters the launch year and introduces an unfounded periodicity to challenge the candidate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the NAFINDEX's function as a measure of financial inclusion based on NAFIS data, including access to credit, insurance, and pensions.


**7. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that PACS are *not* regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. They are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by state-level authorities. This tests the candidate's understanding of the regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly indicates that DCCBs are a key source of funds for PACS, highlighting their interconnectedness within the cooperative credit structure.


**8. With reference to household savings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A decline in financial savings poses a significant threat to the banking sector's ability to manage credit risk and maintain liquidity.
2.  The household savings rate is calculated as the ratio of household physical savings (including gold and silver) to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage directly points out that a decrease in financial savings presents challenges for the banking sector's liquidity and credit risk management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage defines the household savings rate as the ratio of *total* household savings (financial and physical) to GDP, not just physical savings.  The question manipulates the definition to create a misleading distractor.


**9. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council and its functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Compensation Cess, levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods, will continue indefinitely to ensure consistent revenue for states.
2. The GST Council has recently established a Group of Ministers (GoM) to address the taxation of luxury, sin, and demerit goods after the compensation cess ends.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the compensation cess is set to end in March 2026, implying its temporary nature. The question introduces a false assumption about the cess's permanency.

2. Taxpayers have a choice between the old scheme (with indexation) and the new scheme (without indexation) for properties purchased before July 23, 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage distinguishes between inheritance tax (levied on inherited property) and estate tax (levied on the total estate value), implying that inheritance tax is not levied on the entire estate. The question confuses the two types of taxes.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately reports the suggestion of introducing inheritance tax in the mentioned paper to address income inequality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While polymetallic nodules are a significant resource in India's EEZ,  the text also mentions other valuable mineral deposits like seafloor massive sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.  The statement oversimplifies the diversity of deep-sea mineral resources found within India's maritime jurisdiction.  India's EEZ is rich in various types of deep-sea minerals, not just polymetallic nodules.  A comprehensive understanding of India's deep-sea mining potential requires acknowledgment of this diversity.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that seafloor massive sulphides are deposits of metal sulphides formed around hydrothermal vents and contain valuable minerals such as copper, gold, silver, and zinc. This accurately reflects the geological formation and composition of these deposits, which are indeed found in the ocean's depths.  The location near hydrothermal vents is a key characteristic of these deposits.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that India's per capita finished steel consumption (97.7 kg in 2023-24) is significantly *lower* than the world average (219.3 kg) and far behind China (628.3 kg). This highlights a key challenge for the Indian steel sector:  relatively low domestic demand compared to global benchmarks. The statement misrepresents the actual data on steel consumption.

Statement 2 is correct. The text identifies "High Logistics Costs" and the "cyclical nature" of steel demand as major challenges for the Indian steel industry. These are critical factors impacting the sector's efficiency, investment, and overall stability.  The statement accurately reflects these challenges, which are widely acknowledged within the industry and policy discussions.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements correctly represent aspects of microfinance regulation and initiatives in India. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the factual details.



**3. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies, Merchant Bankers, and Chit Fund Companies, exercising its powers under Section 45 L (1)(b) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
2.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) insurance facility, established under the DICGC Act, 1961, covers all bank deposits up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh, but does not extend to NBFC depositors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating NBFCs,  it does not regulate all types of NBFCs directly.  The regulation of NBFCs is a shared responsibility amongst various regulatory bodies in India.  For example, Housing Finance Companies are primarily regulated by the National Housing Bank, Merchant Bankers and Venture Capital Funds by SEBI, and Chit Fund Companies by State Governments.  The RBI's regulatory purview over NBFCs is significant, but not all-encompassing.

Statement 2 is correct. The DICGC insurance facility indeed covers bank deposits up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.  However, this coverage is specifically for banks (including commercial banks, regional rural banks, and local area banks) and does not extend to depositors of NBFCs. This highlights a key difference in the risk profile and regulatory treatment of banks and NBFCs.

Options (a) and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is factually correct.


**4. With reference to the RBI's role in regulating the financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), published annually in July, measures the extent of financial inclusion using a single-value index (0 to 100), incorporating details from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors, and is based on three parameters: Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%).
2. The Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), formed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; RBI Act, 1934; and Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, covers all commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above, and Non-Banking Financial Companies (except Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above that accept deposits or have customer interfaces, to provide cost-free redressal of customer complaints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the RBI's FI-Index.  The index indeed uses a 0-100 scale to capture the level of financial inclusion, encompassing various financial sectors. The weighting of parameters (Access, Usage, Quality) and the annual July publication are also correct.  The index provides a comprehensive assessment of financial inclusion across the country.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RB-IOS is a crucial part of RBI's alternate grievance redressal framework. The legislation mentioned (Banking Regulation Act, 1949; RBI Act, 1934; Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007) forms the legal basis for the scheme. The inclusion of various financial institutions (commercial banks, RRBs, UCBs, and specific NBFCs) and the provision of cost-free redressal are all accurate components of the scheme.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the RBI's initiatives in financial inclusion and grievance redressal. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are true.


**5.  With reference to the regulation of  Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and their transition to Universal Banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  To transition into a Universal Bank, an SFB must maintain a minimum net worth of ₹1,000 crore, be a scheduled bank with a satisfactory performance track record for at least five years, and have net profits in the last two financial years, with Gross NPAs and Net NPAs not exceeding 3% and 1%, respectively, over the same period.
2.  SFBs seeking to become Universal Banks must have their shares listed on a recognized stock exchange, maintain existing promoter shareholding and dilution plans approved by the RBI, and prioritize a diversified loan portfolio.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately outlines several key eligibility criteria for SFBs seeking to transition to Universal Banks. The stipulated minimum net worth, the five-year performance track record requirement, the profitability condition, and the asset quality thresholds (G-NPA and N-NPA) are all integral parts of the RBI's guidelines. These stipulations aim to ensure the financial soundness and stability of institutions making this transition.

Statement 2 also correctly describes additional criteria. The requirement for stock exchange listing ensures greater transparency and accountability. The preservation of existing promoter shareholding and dilution plans reflects the RBI's focus on maintaining stability in ownership structures during the transition.  The preference for diversified loan portfolios is consistent with promoting a balanced and resilient banking model.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements correctly reflect the RBI's stipulations for SFBs aiming to become Universal Banks. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate and relevant to the transition process.


**6. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and their management, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's biannual Financial Stability Report (FSR) regularly assesses the NPA situation in the banking sector, highlighting achievements in NPA reduction and potential risks such as liquidity and credit risks.
2.  The RBI has revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks, mandating that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) under Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms be charged as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account, with net profits allocated to BDDR after complying with IRACP norms and other regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the RBI's role in monitoring and assessing NPAs. The FSR serves as a crucial tool for analyzing the health of the banking system, highlighting progress made in reducing NPAs and identifying potential risks such as liquidity and credit risks.  This proactive approach is critical for maintaining financial stability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI has indeed revised NPA provisioning norms for cooperative banks.  The requirement to charge BDDR provisions as an expense to the Profit and Loss Account reflects a strengthened approach to risk management.  The stipulation that net profits can be allocated to BDDR only after adhering to IRACP norms and other regulations ensures adherence to accounting standards and regulatory compliance.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately depict the RBI's actions in managing NPAs. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually correct and reflect important aspects of NPA management.


**7. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements correctly describe the characteristics and roles of IREDA and SECI. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate.


**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the UCB sector, primarily focusing on regulatory compliance and technological advancements.
2.  The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, primarily monitors capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NUCFDC, registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, acts as an umbrella organization for UCBs.  A key function is to act as an SRO, assisting UCBs in complying with the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and facilitating communication with regulators.  It also aims to develop a shared technological platform to enhance service delivery efficiency.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI's new PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, replaces the SAF.  Its core focus is on monitoring three key parameters: capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability to ensure the financial health of UCBs.  The framework aims to address these aspects with greater precision and flexibility.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Microfinance in India:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹20 lakh under the 'Tarun Plus' category to those who have successfully repaid loans previously taken under the 'Tarun' category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's definition of microfinance loans specifies an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  Loans to individuals with higher annual incomes would not typically be classified as microfinance loans.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget increased the loan limit under PMMY's 'Tarun' category to ₹20 lakh, specifically for those who have previously availed and repaid loans under the 'Tarun' category. This new category is referred to as 'Tarun Plus'.


**3. With reference to the livestock sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are unified genomic chips developed to improve the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds, primarily focusing on disease resistance and milk yield.
2.  The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) aims to control and eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, while simultaneously promoting the use of antibiotics in livestock to enhance overall health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Gau Chip" (for cattle) and "Mahish Chip" (for buffaloes) are unified genomic chips developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying.  These chips are instrumental in improving breed identification, genetic selection, and disease management, ultimately contributing to enhanced productivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NADCP aims to control and eradicate FMD and Brucellosis, it does *not* promote the use of antibiotics.  In fact, the overuse of antibiotics is a significant concern in the livestock sector due to the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance.  The NADCP focuses on preventative measures and disease control strategies that minimize the need for antibiotics.


**4. With reference to the  National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) and the Pandemic Fund Project, consider the following statements:**

1. The NADCP primarily focuses on controlling and eradicating Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, while the Pandemic Fund Project aims to enhance India's capacity to respond to animal health threats and pandemics.
2.  The Pandemic Fund Project, a $25 million initiative, is solely funded by the Indian government and implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NADCP's primary objective is the control and eradication of FMD and Brucellosis.  The Pandemic Fund Project, however, has a broader scope, aiming to strengthen India's capacity to prepare for and respond to various animal health threats and potential pandemics.  This includes upgrading laboratories, enhancing surveillance mechanisms, and improving data management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pandemic Fund Project is a $25 million initiative funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund, established under Indonesia's G20 Presidency.  It's not solely funded by the Indian government.  Furthermore, the project's implementation involves multiple entities, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not just the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying.


**5. Consider the following statements about the  White Revolution 2.0:**

1. The Ministry of Cooperatives has released Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on White Revolution 2.0, focusing primarily on increasing milk production through technological advancements and improved breeding practices.
2. White Revolution 2.0 aims to enhance the efficiency of the dairy sector by focusing solely on increasing the production of milk, while neglecting other aspects of the dairy value chain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ministry of Cooperatives has indeed released SOPs on White Revolution 2.0.  While the initiative aims to improve milk production, it encompasses a broader approach than just technological advancements and breeding.  It addresses various aspects of the dairy value chain, including processing, marketing, and farmer welfare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. White Revolution 2.0 does not focus solely on increasing milk production.  It aims for a holistic improvement of the dairy sector, encompassing the entire value chain from production to marketing and distribution.  Neglecting other aspects would not be a sustainable or effective approach to enhancing the dairy industry.


**6. With reference to the Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India's banking sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Financial Stability Report (FSR), published biannually by the RBI, indicates that Scheduled Commercial Banks' Gross NPAs (GNPAs) and Net NPA ratios reached multi-year lows at the end of March 2024, primarily due to the implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
2.  A Non-Performing Asset (NPA) is classified as such when a loan or advance is overdue for more than 180 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FSR does indeed report on NPA levels in the banking sector, and as of March 2024, GNPAs and Net NPAs did reach multi-year lows. While the IBC has played a role in NPA resolution, it's not the sole factor contributing to this improvement. Other factors, such as improved credit appraisal and monitoring, also contributed to this positive trend.


Statement 2 is incorrect. An NPA is classified as such when a loan or advance is overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days.  This is a crucial distinction in understanding the definition and classification of NPAs within the banking system.


**7. With reference to  the  Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, while the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹10 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a crucial role in evaluating central sector PPP projects. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for the overall policy framework and strategic direction related to PPPs in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The target for the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹10 lakh crore, over the four years from FY22 to FY25.  This is a significant difference and demonstrates the importance of precise factual recall in understanding the NMP's goals and scope.



**8. With reference to the  NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, provides a comprehensive overview of the rural population's access to financial services, including loans, insurance, and pensions, and is used to calculate the NAFINDEX, a measure of financial inclusion.
2.  The second NAFIS, conducted in 2021-22, primarily focused on assessing the impact of demonetization on rural financial inclusion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAFIS is a comprehensive survey providing insights into rural financial inclusion across various financial services.  The NAFINDEX, derived from NAFIS data, serves as a key indicator of financial inclusion levels in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the second NAFIS (2021-22) did provide insights into the state of rural financial inclusion, it did not primarily focus on the impact of demonetization. Its scope was broader, encompassing various aspects of financial inclusion since the first NAFIS in 2016-17.  The impact of demonetization would be one of several factors considered in the analysis.


**9. Consider the following statements about the  International Monetary Fund (IMF):**

1. The IMF provides financial support to countries facing crises, primarily through concessional loans tailored to the specific needs of low-income countries, and it lends for specific projects.
2. The "Gold Tranche" (Reserve Tranche) is a credit system granted by the IMF to its members, providing access to funds at market-based interest rates.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. While the IMF does provide financial support to countries in crisis, it does *not* primarily lend through concessional loans tailored to low-income countries.  It offers a range of lending instruments, some concessional and some non-concessional.  Moreover, unlike development banks, the IMF does *not* lend for specific projects; its lending is aimed at addressing macroeconomic imbalances and overall economic stability.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The "Gold Tranche" (Reserve Tranche) is a credit system granted by the IMF, but it is not provided at market-based interest rates.  It's a part of a member country's quota subscription and is essentially a readily available, short-term borrowing facility.  The interest rates on other IMF lending instruments vary depending on the specific facility and the borrowing country's circumstances.


**10. With reference to the  World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP, launched in 2024, consolidates all guarantee products and experts from across the World Bank Group (WBG) institutions at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), aiming to boost WBG annual guarantee issuance to $10 billion by 2030.
2. The World Bank provides guarantees to private lenders primarily for infrastructure projects that face significant political and sovereign risks, requiring large loans and long-term financing.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and expertise at MIGA.  However, the target for annual guarantee issuance by 2030 is $20 billion, not $10 billion.

Statement 2 is correct.  The World Bank (through its guarantee mechanisms) does provide guarantees to private lenders, particularly for infrastructure projects facing substantial political and sovereign risks.  Such projects often necessitate large loans and long-term financing to ensure successful completion.  The guarantees mitigate risks for private lenders, thereby encouraging investment in these crucial projects.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural export policy:**

1.  The ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was not achieved.
2.  Agricultural exports and imports both witnessed a decline during 2023-24.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 policy.  This validates statement 1.  Furthermore, the text mentions a decline in both agricultural exports and imports during the same period (2023-24), making statement 2 also correct. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the information presented.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only consider one statement as true, while (d) is incorrect as both statements are supported by the given information. The question tests factual recall related to recent trends in India's agricultural exports and imports, highlighting the challenges faced in achieving ambitious export targets.

1.  The MSP covers a total of 24 crops, including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 4 commercial crops.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any further review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the MSP covers 22 crops (14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops), along with additional MSPs fixed for Toria and de-husked coconut based on other crops.  The number 24 is not mentioned.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the CACP recommends the MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister. Therefore, the CACP's role is advisory, not solely decisive.  The question tests the understanding of the MSP mechanism and the roles of different bodies involved in its determination.  It highlights potential misconceptions about the number of crops covered and the final authority for MSP fixation.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF):**

1.  The AIF provides short-term debt financing for post-harvest management infrastructure.
2.  Loans under the AIF are offered with an interest subvention of 5% per annum and credit guarantee coverage up to ₹5 Crores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF is described as a *medium-long term* debt financing facility, not short-term.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text specifies an interest subvention of 3% per annum, not 5%, and credit guarantee coverage up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹5 Crores.  The question tests the understanding of the AIF's key features, including the loan tenure and the extent of financial support provided.  The incorrect figures in the statements serve as plausible distractors, requiring precise recall of the details.


**4. With reference to the Digital Agriculture Mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mission's foundational pillars are the Agri Stack and the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS), which utilizes data from RISAT-2A.
2.  The key targets of the mission include creating digital identities for 15 crore farmers over five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Agri Stack and Krishi DSS are indeed foundational pillars, the DSS utilizes data from RISAT-1A, not RISAT-2A.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text mentions a target of creating digital identities for 11 crore farmers over *three* years, not 15 crore over five years.  The question assesses the understanding of the Digital Agriculture Mission's core components and its implementation targets.  The subtle inaccuracies in the statements serve as effective distractors, requiring careful attention to detail.



**5. Consider the following statements concerning India's livestock sector:**

1.  India's average annual cattle productivity surpasses the global average.
2.  The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are genomic chips developed for poultry and pigs, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that India's average annual cattle productivity is lower than the world average (1777 kg/animal/year vs. 2699 kg/animal/year).  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" are for cattle and buffaloes, not poultry and pigs. The question tests knowledge about the challenges and initiatives in India's livestock sector. The incorrect information in the statements acts as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the subject matter.


**6. With reference to the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. It aims to improve the quality of milk and milk products by strengthening infrastructure.
2. It is implemented to enhance the productivity of crossbred cattle breeds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While infrastructure improvement is important for the dairy sector, the Rashtriya Gokul Mission's primary focus is on the development and conservation of *indigenous* bovine breeds, not general infrastructure improvement for milk quality enhancement. That's the aim of the National Programme for Dairy Development. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the mission prioritizes indigenous breeds, not crossbred ones. The question tests the specific objectives of the Rashtriya Gokul Mission, differentiating it from other dairy sector initiatives. The incorrect options highlight the importance of understanding the nuances of different government schemes.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1.  The 2024 MPI report indicates that India has the second-largest number of people living in extreme poverty.
2. The MPI considers deprivations in education, health, and living standards, with a person classified as MPI poor if deprived in at least 50% of indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

The passage describes a revised PSL framework that introduces an incentive framework for districts with lower credit flow and a disincentive framework for districts with high loan availability.  This involves differential weighting (125% for low-credit districts and 90% for high-credit districts), contradicting the statement's claim of uniform weighting.  This highlights the nuanced approach to addressing regional disparities in credit access.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that PSLCs are *tradable* certificates, enabling banks to meet their targets by purchasing these instruments if they have a shortfall. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion that PSLCs are non-tradable.  The tradability feature is a key mechanism for facilitating credit flow within the PSL framework.


**5.  With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will come into effect from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  All UCBs, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID), are subject to the new PCA framework.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the new PCA framework for UCBs will be effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024. This indicates a misunderstanding of the timeline for implementing the revised framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID) from the application of the new PCA framework.  This shows a lack of understanding of the exceptions and limitations within the framework's scope.


**6. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All loans with a value exceeding ₹3,00,000 to individual(s) belonging to low-income households are considered microfinance loans.
2.  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India are typically characterized by lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that *all collateral-free loans* to individuals/groups from low-income households (annual income up to ₹3,00,000) are considered microfinance loans.  The statement incorrectly focuses on the loan value rather than the collateral and income criteria. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific criteria defining microfinance loans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage specifically notes that MFIs usually charge *higher* interest rates than commercial banks. This misrepresents the typical interest rate structure in the microfinance sector, contrasting it with the lower rates offered by established banks.  This is a crucial distinction to understand the cost implications for borrowers in the microfinance sector.


**7. With reference to the Indian Jute sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the exclusive use of jute for packaging all commodities.
2.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI) was established in 1972 primarily to facilitate the export of jute products.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials Act of 1987 mandates the *compulsory use* of jute packaging material for certain commodities, not the *exclusive* use for all commodities. The statement overstates the scope of the Act's mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the JCI was established in 1971 as a price support agency, not primarily for export promotion. The statement misrepresents JCI's primary function, confusing its role with that of an export-focused organization.  The JCI's price support role is critical for ensuring fair prices for jute farmers.


**8. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NAFIS was first launched in 2017-18, providing a comprehensive overview of financial inclusion indicators.
2.  The NAFINDEX, based on NAFIS data, exclusively measures access to formal banking services in rural areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that NAFIS was launched in 2016-17, not 2017-18. This shows a slight inaccuracy in the timeline of the survey's initiation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NAFINDEX uses NAFIS data, it measures financial inclusion comprehensively, encompassing loans, insurance, pensions, and not solely formal banking services. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of NAFINDEX's measurement to just banking services.  The comprehensive nature of NAFINDEX is important for understanding various facets of financial inclusion.


**9. With reference to the RBI's Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is published bi-annually, providing updated assessments of financial inclusion.
2. The FI-Index incorporates data from the banking, investment, insurance, and postal sectors, but excludes the pension sector.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the FI-Index is published *annually* in July, not bi-annually. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the publication frequency of the index.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the FI-Index includes data from the banking, investments, insurance, postal, *and* pension sectors. The statement incorrectly omits the pension sector from the index's components. The inclusion of the pension sector is vital for a holistic assessment of financial inclusion.


**10. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Surplus and its transfer to the government, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of the RBI's entire net interest income to the central government.
2.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, dictates that surplus transfers are solely based on realized equity levels.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Section 47 of the RBI Act mandates the transfer of profits to the Centre, it does not specify the transfer of the *entire* net interest income. The statement oversimplifies the process of profit allocation and transfer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ECF, as per the Bimal Jalan Committee, bases surplus transfers on both realized equity and economic capital (CGRA) levels. The statement incorrectly limits the criteria to only realized equity.  Understanding both these factors is essential for comprehending the ECF's mechanism for surplus transfers.



**1. With reference to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  One of the primary functions of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) is to provide refinancing to PACS through NABARD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS). They are *not* regulated by the RBI or under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  This is a crucial distinction often missed. While they operate within the cooperative credit structure, their regulatory framework is different from commercial banks.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs play a vital role in the three-tier cooperative credit structure.  A key function is providing funds to PACS, which in turn lend to farmers. NABARD further refinances these DCCBs and SCBs, ensuring a continuous flow of credit to the grassroots level. This refinancing mechanism is crucial for the financial stability and operational efficiency of PACS. The statement accurately reflects this important function within the cooperative credit system.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the regulatory oversight and refinancing mechanisms related to PACS.


**2. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), primarily focused on providing internal support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  One of NUCFDC's key functions is to develop a shared technological platform to enable UCBs to expand their services more cost-effectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type *II* NBFC-ND.  The distinction between Type I and Type II is significant.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds and have direct interaction with customers, unlike Type I. NUCFDC's role as an umbrella organization for UCBs necessitates this direct customer interface to facilitate its various support functions.

Statement 2 is correct.  A major objective of NUCFDC is to create a shared technological platform for UCBs. This is designed to reduce the individual costs of technological upgrades and service expansion for each UCB, promoting efficiency and wider reach within the urban cooperative banking sector.  This initiative aims to modernize the UCB sector and enhance its competitiveness.

2.  The primary objective of VCS is to establish two-way communication with fishermen, facilitating emergency rescue and safety operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The VCS is an *indigenous* technology developed by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).  This highlights India's technological capabilities in addressing specific challenges within its maritime sector. The development and implementation of this system showcase self-reliance and innovation.

Statement 2 is correct. The core purpose of the VCS is to enable two-way communication with fishing vessels. This is crucial for providing timely assistance during emergencies, improving safety protocols, and enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the fishing industry.


**4. With reference to the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), consider the following statements:**

1. JCI was established in 1971 as a price support agency for cotton, with the primary aim to regulate cotton prices.
2.  The Jute I-CARE project focuses on promoting the use of traditional jute farming techniques to ensure sustainable practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. JCI was established in 1971 as a price support agency for *jute*, not cotton.  The primary goal was to stabilize jute prices and support the jute farmers.  The focus on jute is essential to understanding JCI's role in the Indian economy and its impact on the jute industry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jute I-CARE project focuses on *mechanization* in jute farming and *accelerated retting* using microbial consortium.  It aims at improving efficiency and yield through modern techniques, rather than relying solely on traditional methods.


**5. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFIS was launched in 2017-18 to assess the financial inclusion levels of urban populations.
2.  NAFINDEX, based on data from NAFIS, measures financial inclusion levels in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS was launched in 2016-17, focusing on the *rural* population, not urban. The survey's specific focus on rural areas is essential for understanding its scope and objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. NAFINDEX is indeed a key metric derived from NAFIS data, providing a quantitative assessment of financial inclusion in rural India.  The index helps policymakers track progress and identify areas needing improvement in financial access and services in rural areas.


**6. With reference to the revised Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revised norms introduce a disincentive framework for districts with low credit flow, reducing the weight given to fresh priority sector loans in such districts.
2. All bank loans to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) automatically qualify for classification under PSL.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised norms introduce a *disincentive* framework for districts with *high* credit flow, not low.  Districts with high loan availability will have a lower weight given to their fresh priority sector loans.  This mechanism aims to direct more credit towards underserved areas.

Statement 2 is correct.  The revised PSL norms explicitly state that all bank loans to MSMEs qualify for classification under PSL.  This is a significant policy decision aimed at supporting the growth and development of the MSME sector.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF):**

1. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 5% per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹5 Crores.
2.  The recent expansion of AIF includes allowing convergence of Component-A of PM-KUSUM with AIF for farmer/group of farmers/Farmer Producer Organizations/Cooperatives/Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 3%, not 5%, per annum, and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹5 Crores.  These figures are specific and crucial for understanding the financial aspects of the AIF scheme.

Statement 2 is correct.  The recent expansion of AIF explicitly includes the convergence of Component-A of PM-KUSUM. This convergence aims to enhance the reach and impact of both schemes in promoting sustainable agricultural practices and infrastructure development.


**8. With reference to the RBI's revised Non-Performing Asset (NPA) provision norms for cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The revised norms mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) under Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms must be charged as an expense to the balance sheet.
2. Cooperative banks are allowed to allocate net profits to BDDR only after complying with IRACP norms and other relevant regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised norms mandate that provisions for BDDR under IRACP norms must be charged as an expense to the *Profit and Loss Account*, not the balance sheet.  This is a critical detail in understanding the accounting implications of the revised norms.

Statement 2 is correct.  The revised norms clearly state that the allocation of net profits to BDDR is permitted only after fulfilling the requirements of IRACP norms and other applicable regulations.  This ensures adherence to sound financial practices and strengthens the regulatory framework for cooperative banks.


**9. With reference to the Ministry of Cooperation's "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector," consider the following statements:**

1. The plan aims to establish centralized storage facilities at the district level, managed by District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs).
2.  PACS can avail subsidies and interest subvention benefits for the construction of godowns/storage facilities and setting up other agri-infrastructure under this plan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The plan aims to establish *decentralized* storage facilities at the PACS level, not centralized facilities at the district level.  This decentralized approach is crucial for ensuring efficient grain storage closer to the farmers.

Statement 2 is correct.  The plan explicitly provides subsidies and interest subvention benefits to PACS for constructing storage facilities and other agricultural infrastructure.  This financial support is essential for enabling PACS to participate effectively in the initiative.


**10. With reference to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and its Open Market Sale Scheme (Domestic) (OMSS-Domestic), consider the following statements:**

1.  States can purchase rice from FCI under the OMSS-Domestic only through participation in e-auctions.
2.  The primary objective of OMSS-Domestic is to ensure sufficient grain availability for Public Distribution System (PDS) operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. States *can* purchase rice from FCI under the OMSS-Domestic *without* participating in e-auctions from August 1, 2024. This modification to the OMSS-Domestic scheme provides flexibility to states in procuring rice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary objective of OMSS-Domestic is to *control market prices* and curb inflation, not solely to ensure sufficient grain for PDS operations, although it indirectly contributes to PDS stability.  The focus on price control is a key aspect of the OMSS-Domestic scheme.


**1. With reference to India's technical textiles sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to establish India as the world's largest producer of technical textiles.
2.  The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles specifically excludes technical textiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Technical Textiles Mission aims to significantly boost India's position in the global technical textiles market,  the goal is to become a global leader, not necessarily the *largest* producer.  The statement overstates the mission's objective.  There is a difference between market leadership and sheer production volume; market leadership incorporates factors like innovation, technology, and value addition, not just quantity.

Statement 2 is correct. The PLI scheme for textiles, while a significant initiative to boost the overall textile sector, is a broader scheme.  It supports various segments within the textile industry, but its specific focus is not solely on technical textiles.  Technical textiles often receive support through dedicated schemes and missions, rather than being implicitly included in broader textile initiatives.  Therefore, stating it *specifically excludes* technical textiles is accurate in the context that it doesn't have a primary, dedicated focus on this niche segment.


**2. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI comprises industries contributing over 50% of the weight of items in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2.  Petroleum Refinery Products hold the lowest weight in the ICI calculation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The eight core industries included in the ICI contribute 40.27% of the weight of items in the IIP, not over 50%. This is a significant portion, but it is crucial to note the precise figure for accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Petroleum Refinery Products have the highest weight (28.04%) in the ICI calculation, not the lowest. Electricity holds the second-highest weight (19.85%). The statement completely reverses the actual weight distribution within the ICI.


**3. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is a private organization responsible for issuing the ISI mark.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is mandatory only for *certain* products specified by the Central Government through Quality Control Orders (QCOs).  It's not a universal requirement for all goods sold within India. Many products are sold without an ISI mark.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is the *national* standard body of India, established under the BIS Act, 2016. It is a statutory body, a government organization, not a private entity.  The statement misrepresents the nature and governance of the BIS.



**4. With reference to India's FMCG sector and the concept of 'Green Shoots,' consider the following statements:**

1.  The term 'Green Shoots' refers to the initial signs of economic recovery in a sector after a period of stagnation or decline.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified the urban economy as the primary driver of Green Shoots in the FMCG sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. 'Green Shoots' accurately describes the early indicators of economic growth following a downturn.  It signifies nascent positive trends that suggest a potential for broader economic recovery.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI highlighted the *rural* economy as the source of Green Shoots in the FMCG sector, not the urban economy.  The statement incorrectly attributes the source of this positive economic indicator.  Rural consumption often plays a crucial role in FMCG sector performance, and the RBI's observation points to the significance of rural economic activity.


**5. With reference to the Amended Technology Upgradation Funds Scheme (ATUFS) in the textile sector, consider the following statements:**

1. ATUFS is a grant-based scheme providing direct financial assistance to textile units.
2. The primary aim of ATUFS is to promote the use of traditional handloom techniques.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ATUFS is a *credit-linked* subsidy scheme, not a grant-based scheme. This means that financial assistance is provided through subsidies on loans taken by textile units for modernization and technology upgradation, not as direct grants.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary aim of ATUFS is to encourage *modernization* and *technology upgradation* in the textile industry to enhance competitiveness and efficiency. While traditional handloom techniques are important, ATUFS's focus is on technological advancement, not preservation of traditional methods.

1. The NLP aims to improve India's ranking in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) to be among the top 10 globally by 2030.
2. The NLP focuses solely on hard infrastructure development, such as port expansion and road construction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NLP aims to place India among the top 25 countries in the LPI ranking by 2030, not the top 10.  The statement overestimates the policy's ambition regarding global ranking.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NLP addresses both *soft* and *hard* infrastructure aspects.  While hard infrastructure (physical infrastructure) is a component,  the policy also emphasizes soft infrastructure improvements such as process reforms, digitization, and human resource development within the logistics sector.  The statement ignores the crucial soft infrastructure elements of the NLP.


**7. With reference to the  'World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector,' consider the following statements:**

1. The plan involves the construction of new grain storage facilities exclusively in the private sector.
2. The plan's pilot project covers primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) across all Indian states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The plan focuses on the *cooperative* sector, not the private sector.  The initiative aims to strengthen the existing cooperative infrastructure for grain storage, not create new facilities solely in the private sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The pilot project covers PACS across 11 states, not all states in India.  The statement incorrectly generalizes the geographical scope of the pilot phase.


**8. With reference to the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), consider the following statements:**

1. MIDH is a state-sponsored scheme focusing solely on the production of fruits and vegetables.
2.  MIDH includes sub-schemes such as the National Horticulture Mission and the Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MIDH is a *centrally sponsored* scheme, not state-sponsored, and its scope extends beyond just fruits and vegetables. It also covers root & tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cashew, cocoa, and bamboo.  The statement significantly understates the scope of MIDH.

Statement 2 is correct. MIDH indeed comprises several sub-schemes, including the National Horticulture Mission and the Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States.  These sub-schemes are integral parts of the broader MIDH initiative.


**9. With reference to Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX), consider the following statements:**

1. ADeX is a platform primarily designed for the dissemination of agricultural market prices to international traders.
2. ADeX includes datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ADeX is primarily designed for *farmer services* and improved decision-making within the agricultural sector. While market information might be a component, it is not the primary function.  The statement misrepresents the core purpose of ADeX.

Statement 2 is correct. ADeX indeed incorporates datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown. This information is crucial for efficient agricultural planning, resource allocation, and service delivery to farmers.


**10. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) sets the MSP for all agricultural commodities, including livestock and poultry.
2. The MSP is announced at the beginning of the harvesting season.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CACP recommends MSPs for 24 crops (including Kharif, Rabi and commercial crops), but it doesn't cover all agricultural commodities. Livestock and poultry are not typically included in the MSP system.  The statement overextends the CACP's purview regarding MSP determination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MSP is announced at the beginning of the *sowing* season, not the harvesting season.  The announcement is timed to guide farmers' planting decisions, not to influence post-harvest market dynamics.  The statement misrepresents the timing of MSP announcements.



**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) oversight of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs, irrespective of their asset size, are subject to RBI's regulatory framework regarding deposit acceptance and customer interface.
2.  Housing Finance Companies are explicitly excluded from the RBI's purview regarding deposit acceptance and customer interface regulations for NBFCs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's regulatory framework for NBFCs concerning deposit acceptance and customer interface applies specifically to those with assets of ₹100 crore and above, excluding Housing Finance Companies.  Smaller NBFCs may have less stringent regulatory oversight. The statement incorrectly generalizes the regulatory scope to all NBFCs.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the RBI regulations exclude Housing Finance Companies from this specific set of oversight rules concerning deposit acceptance and customer interfaces. This exemption is a key distinction in the regulatory landscape for NBFCs.  The exclusion highlights a difference in risk profiles and regulatory approaches adopted by the RBI.


**2. With reference to the Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be eligible for recognition by the RBI.
2.  The RBI's Omnibus Framework mandates that at least one-third of the members in an SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The eligibility criteria for an SRO under the RBI's framework specifically require it to be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  The statement incorrectly states that it must be a for-profit entity, misrepresenting a crucial aspect of the SRO's structure and purpose.  The non-profit nature is fundamental to the SRO's role in promoting the interests of its members rather than pursuing profit maximization.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's framework explicitly mandates that at least one-third of the members in the SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent. This requirement aims to enhance the objectivity and impartiality of the SRO's governance and decision-making processes. It is a standard corporate governance practice to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure robust oversight.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) sector was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which accurately reflects NUCFDC's functions. The error in the statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of the categorization of NBFCs.  The distinction between Type I and Type II NBFCs is significant in terms of regulatory requirements and operational scope.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee does evaluate central sector PPP projects, its jurisdiction is limited to the central government level.  State-level PPP projects have their own evaluation mechanisms, leading to variations in standards and processes across different states. The statement oversimplifies the complex regulatory landscape of PPPs in India, which involves multiple layers of governance and oversight.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative aimed at attracting private investment into India's infrastructure. It achieves this by monetizing existing government assets, thereby generating revenue and promoting further infrastructure development.  Although it involves private sector participation, its primary focus is on asset monetization rather than the establishment of new PPP projects from the ground up.  This is a key distinction from traditional PPP models.


**3. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership exclusively focused on assisting developed countries in leveraging trade for economic growth.
2. The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) acts as the EIF's Trust Fund Manager.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF's mandate is specifically directed towards assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs), not developed countries. Its aim is to empower LDCs to utilize trade as a catalyst for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction. The focus is on capacity building and facilitating access to global markets for these nations. The statement misrepresents the EIF's primary target beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNOPS (United Nations Office for Project Services) plays a crucial role in the EIF as its Trust Fund Manager.  This involves overseeing the financial management of the EIF's resources and ensuring the effective implementation of its programs and projects.

1. The ambitious target set by India’s Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, was to achieve agricultural exports of $50 billion by 2022.
2.  Agricultural exports in India experienced a significant increase in 2023-24, surpassing the ambitious target set by the 2018 policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The India’s Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, indeed aimed for agricultural exports to reach $60 billion (not $50 billion) by 2022.  While the target was ambitious, it underscores the government's commitment to promoting agricultural exports. The statement accurately reflects the policy's target.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that agricultural exports in India registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the ambitious target. The statement contradicts the factual data on the performance of agricultural exports.


**10. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All seven CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2. SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seven CRAs are registered with SEBI, only six (excluding Brickwork Ratings) are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.  This distinction highlights the nuances of regulatory oversight in the financial sector. The statement makes an inaccurate generalization about the RBI accreditation of all SEBI-registered CRAs.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulations for CRAs explicitly require transparency in their operations. This includes mandatory disclosure of rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policies, and guidelines for handling conflicts of interest.  This regulatory requirement is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of the credit rating process.


**11. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds that allow investments in infrastructure projects, and are regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
2.  The new SEBI norms allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only upon the acquisition of an infrastructure project.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  InvITs are indeed similar to mutual funds and allow investment in infrastructure projects, but they are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), not the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India).  The statement incorrectly identifies the regulatory body overseeing InvITs.

Statement 2 is correct. The recent amendments to SEBI's InvIT regulations specifically permit privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only when acquiring an infrastructure project. This measure aims to address valuation discrepancies between the sponsor (seller) and the InvIT (buyer). The statement accurately reflects a key change in InvIT regulations.


**12. With reference to Asset Monetization in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended asset monetization in 2010, which was subsequently implemented through the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) in the Union Budget 2021-22.
2. Asset monetization primarily involves the outright sale of government-owned assets to private entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation for asset monetization did occur in 2012 (not 2010), and the NMP (National Monetisation Pipeline) was indeed announced in the Union Budget 2021-22 as a major initiative for implementing asset monetization. The statement accurately reflects the timeline and key policy developments related to asset monetization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Asset monetization doesn't necessarily involve outright sales.  It encompasses a broader range of transactions, including licensing, leasing, and concessions, where government assets are utilized by private entities in exchange for payments or revenue sharing.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of the asset monetization process.


**13. With reference to the Digital Agriculture Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Digital Agriculture Mission's foundational pillars include the Agri Stack (Kisan ki Pehchaan) and the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS), which utilizes data from RISAT-1A and VEDAS.

These diseases cause significant mortality and reduced productivity, leading to substantial economic losses.  The statement oversimplifies the complex causes of economic losses in the livestock sector.


**15. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, brought the management, governance, and winding up of UCBs under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for the UCB sector, exclusively managing liquidity and capital support for UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, amendments did indeed bring various aspects of UCB management, governance, and winding-up procedures under the RBI's direct oversight.  This strengthens regulatory control over UCBs and enhances their stability. The statement accurately reflects a key regulatory change affecting UCBs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NUCFDC does operate as an SRO (Self-Regulatory Organization) and provides liquidity and capital support, its functions extend beyond these aspects.  It also works on regulatory compliance, facilitating communication with regulators, and developing technological platforms for UCBs.  The statement presents an incomplete and therefore inaccurate description of the NUCFDC's role.


**16. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The new PCA framework will be implemented from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The framework applies to all UCBs irrespective of their tier categorization, including those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).

This exception reflects a differentiated approach to managing the financial health of UCBs based on their specific circumstances. The statement misrepresents the scope of the PCA framework's application.


**17. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An NPA is a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 60 days.
2. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) is responsible for the direct implementation of measures to reduce NPAs, such as the SARFAESI Act, 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  An NPA (Non-Performing Asset) is defined as a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 90 days, not 60 days. This difference in the number of days highlights the importance of precise definitions in financial terminology. The statement contains an inaccurate definition of an NPA.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FSDC (Financial Stability and Development Council) is an apex-level forum that provides overall guidance and coordination on financial stability.  It does not directly implement measures like the SARFAESI Act, 2002.  The implementation of such Acts rests with the relevant regulatory authorities and institutions. The statement misrepresents the FSDC's role in NPA management.


**18. With reference to the initiatives taken to reduce NPAs, consider the following statements:**

1. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, primarily focuses on the resolution of stressed assets in the public sector.
2. The PRAVAAH portal is a centralized platform for seeking regulatory approvals related to financial institutions and their operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), 2016, is designed to address stressed assets across various sectors, including private and public entities. Its scope is not limited to the public sector alone. The statement incorrectly restricts the IBC's application.

Statement 2 is correct. The PRAVAAH portal (Platform for Regulatory Application, Validation, and Authorisation) serves as a centralized and secure online platform for obtaining necessary authorizations, licenses, and regulatory approvals from various financial sector regulators.  The statement accurately describes the functionality and purpose of the PRAVAAH portal.


**19. With reference to the government's initiatives for gig and platform workers, consider the following statements:**

1. The Code on Social Security, 2020, proposed the establishment of a Social Security Fund and a National Social Security Board to oversee the well-being of gig and platform workers.
2. The PM Suraksha Bima Yojana provides gig workers with an accidental insurance cover of ₹1 Lakh per year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Code on Social Security, 2020, did indeed propose the creation of a Social Security Fund and a National Social Security Board.  This was a significant step towards providing social security benefits to gig and platform workers.  The statement accurately reflects a key provision of the Code.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM Suraksha Bima Yojana offers gig workers an accidental insurance cover of ₹2 Lakh (not ₹1 Lakh) per year.  This numerical discrepancy highlights the need for precision in recalling factual details about government schemes. The statement contains a numerical error.


**20. With reference to the concept of living wage, consider the following statements:**

1. India currently follows a minimum wage system, which has been consistently updated since 2017 to ensure alignment with the cost of living.
2. The Code on Wages, passed in 2019, proposed a universal wage floor that would apply uniformly across all states once fully implemented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's minimum wage system has not been consistently updated since 2017.  In fact, the lack of regular updates and inconsistencies in implementation have been identified as a major issue. The statement presents an inaccurate portrayal of the current minimum wage system in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Code on Wages, enacted in 2019, did propose a universal wage floor, aiming for a nationwide minimum wage standard.  The implementation of this provision is ongoing, and once complete, it will provide a more uniform wage floor across different states.  The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the Code on Wages.


**1. With reference to the Agri Stack initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) utilizes data solely from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s RISAT-1A satellite for real-time agricultural information.
2.  The Farmer ID, a key component of Agri Stack, is linked to farmer-related data such as land records and crop sown information via geo-referenced village maps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) does leverage data from ISRO's RISAT-1A satellite and the Visualization of Earth observation Data and Archival System (VEDAS), it's not solely reliant on RISAT-1A.  The DSS integrates data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of crop conditions, weather patterns, and water resources.  Restricting the data source to only one satellite would significantly limit the accuracy and scope of the DSS.  This makes option (a) and (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The Farmer ID is indeed a crucial element of the Agri Stack, serving as a digital identity for farmers.  This ID is meticulously linked to other crucial farmer-specific data, including land records and information on sown crops, using precisely geo-referenced village maps. This linkage allows for efficient service delivery and streamlined scheme implementation. This makes option (d) incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a key aspect of the Agri Stack's functionality.

However, it is important to note that while the Department is central to the initiative, other research institutions and collaborations may be involved.  The statement is mostly true, and the nuances are unlikely to be fully appreciated by a candidate, making it a difficult question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the newly approved scheme aims to significantly reduce the economic losses caused by diseases like FMD and Brucellosis, claiming complete eradication within five years is an overstatement. Eradicating these widespread diseases requires a long-term, multi-pronged strategy involving vaccination, improved hygiene practices, and better disease surveillance.  This makes option (b), (c), and (d) incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ISI mark is mandatory for all products sold in India, regardless of their nature or category, to ensure quality and safety.
2.  BIS's Eco Mark certification is awarded to products that meet specific environmental standards, covering their entire life cycle from production to disposal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark, while signifying quality and safety, is not mandatory for *all* products sold in India.  The government mandates the ISI mark for specific product categories deemed crucial for public safety and quality, such as electrical appliances, cement, and certain medical equipment.  Many other products are not subject to this mandatory certification. This makes option (a) and (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that the Eco Mark is awarded to environmentally friendly products.  However, the statement oversimplifies the scope of the certification. While it considers environmental aspects throughout the product's life cycle,  the exact criteria and parameters are more complex and may not encompass every aspect from production to ultimate disposal in all cases.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view.  This makes option (b) incorrect.


**4. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all 22 crops, with no further review or modification by the government.
2.  The MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to provide farmers with a price floor after their crops have been sold.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends the MSP for various crops, the final decision on the MSP rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. The CACP's recommendations are crucial, but they are subject to review and final approval by the CCEA. This makes option (a) and (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MSP is announced *before* the sowing season begins, not at the end of the harvesting season. This allows farmers to make informed decisions about which crops to cultivate, ensuring that they receive at least the MSP for their produce. This makes option (b) incorrect.  The timing is critical for farmers' planning and decision-making.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 policy. This clearly contradicts the statement. This makes option (a) and (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TIES does contribute to enhancing infrastructure related to agricultural exports, it is not solely focused on port infrastructure.  The scheme supports the development and upgrading of various infrastructure projects with export linkages, including border haats, land custom stations, cold chains, and trade promotion centers.  This makes option (b) incorrect.  The scope of TIES is broader than what the statement suggests.


**6. With reference to the  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

2.  The AIF's recent expansion includes allowing convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for the creation of solar-powered irrigation systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides loans not only to individual farmers but also to Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and other eligible entities involved in agricultural infrastructure development.  The statement incorrectly limits the beneficiaries. This makes option (a) and (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  The recent expansion of the AIF explicitly mentions allowing convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A, enabling the funding of solar-powered irrigation projects through the AIF. This demonstrates a strategic move towards promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This makes option (d) incorrect.


**7. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee exclusively evaluates PPP projects undertaken by state governments.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) primarily focuses on selling government assets to private entities for immediate revenue generation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not exclusively those of state governments. State governments have their own mechanisms for evaluating PPP projects. This makes option (a) and (c) incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets, but this doesn't necessarily involve outright sales.  Monetization can involve various models, including long-term leases, concessions, and other forms of private sector participation, not just direct sales for immediate revenue.  The statement simplifies the complex nature of the NMP. This makes option (b) incorrect.


**8. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index ranks states based solely on the quality of their road infrastructure.
2. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 primarily focuses on enhancing the hard infrastructure aspects of the logistics sector, such as building new roads and ports.

The government has indeed implemented quality control regulations for various segments within the technical textiles sector, including geo-tech textiles, agro-textiles, and medi-tech textiles.  These regulations are a key component of the overall strategy to ensure quality and competitiveness in the domestic market and for exports.  The omission of this crucial aspect of the government’s initiatives makes the statement incorrect.


**8. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI includes all manufacturing industries in India, representing the complete industrial production in the country.
2. Petroleum refinery products and electricity have the highest weight among the eight core industries included in the ICI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) does *not* encompass all manufacturing industries in India. It focuses specifically on eight core industrial sectors: fertilizers, cement, natural gas, crude oil, coal, electricity, steel, and petroleum refinery products. These eight sectors represent a significant portion of India's industrial production, but they do not constitute the entire industrial landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While petroleum refinery products and electricity are indeed significant components of the ICI, the statement is imprecise.  Petroleum refinery products hold the highest weight (28.04%), but electricity (19.85%) is the second highest, not the first.  There is a difference between the two weights, which makes the statement inaccurate.  The precise weighting of the various core industries is a critical aspect of understanding the ICI's composition and interpretation.


**1. With reference to the National Land Monetization Corporation (NLMC), consider the following statements:**

1. NLMC is a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) under the Ministry of Finance, tasked with the monetization of government-owned land assets.
2.  The primary objective of NLMC is to generate revenue for the government by leasing out surplus land held by Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NLMC is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), not a PSU directly under the Ministry of Finance. While it works in close coordination with the government, its structure is different from a traditional PSU.  It's designed to be more agile and focused on specific monetization goals.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not entirely accurate in its scope.  The NLMC's objective is broader than merely leasing out land.  While leasing is a method, it also engages in other monetization strategies like sale and joint ventures to maximize the value of surplus land assets held not only by CPSEs but also by other government agencies.  The focus is on revenue generation for the government, but the methods are varied and not limited to leasing.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP):**

1. The NICDP aims to establish industrial corridors that will compete with global manufacturing hubs by focusing solely on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).
2. The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) was the second industrial corridor project approved under the NICDP.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While attracting FDI is a significant component, the NICDP's aim is more comprehensive than just FDI attraction. It seeks to develop futuristic industrial cities that are globally competitive by focusing on various aspects like infrastructure development, skill development, technological advancement, and creating a conducive environment for both domestic and foreign investments. It's not solely reliant on FDI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DMIC was the *first*, not the second, industrial corridor project approved under the NICDP. Its approval in 2007 marked the beginning of the program.


**3. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GII 2024 ranked India lower than its 2023 ranking, highlighting a decline in India's innovation capabilities.
2.  The GII 2024's criteria for measuring innovation include factors like infrastructure, human capital, and creative outputs, but excludes the impact of government policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GII 2024 showed an *improvement* in India's ranking, moving up one position from 40th in 2023 to 39th in 2024. This indicates a positive trend, not a decline, in India's innovation performance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GII's assessment of innovation capabilities is multi-faceted and includes the influence of institutional frameworks and government policies on the innovation ecosystem.  It's not limited to just infrastructure, human capital, and creative outputs.  The institutional environment, including government policies, is a crucial factor considered in the GII's methodology.


**4. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional financing (low interest rates or grants) tailored to the specific needs of low-income countries.
2. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) offers long-term financing primarily to high-income countries facing balance-of-payments issues.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GRA provides financing on non-concessional terms, meaning market-based interest rates, not concessional financing. Concessional financing is offered through other IMF lending instruments like the PRGT and RST.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RST primarily targets low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, not high-income countries.  Its focus is on building resilience to external shocks and long-term sustainable development, making it more relevant to countries with lower income levels and greater vulnerability to economic shocks.


**5. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to mitigate risks associated with large-scale infrastructure projects.
2.  The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and expertise from various World Bank Group institutions under the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP aims to *increase*, not reduce, the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance. The goal is to significantly boost the amount of guarantees provided to attract private investment in infrastructure projects, recognizing that guarantees can reduce risk and attract more private sector participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and expertise under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), not the International Finance Corporation (IFC).  MIGA is specifically focused on political risk insurance and guarantees, aligning with the platform's objectives.


**6.  With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1. The framework's two-pillar approach aims to prevent tax avoidance by multinational enterprises (MNEs) by establishing a global minimum corporate tax rate of 25%.
2.  Pillar One of the framework focuses on reallocating a portion of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs to countries where their headquarters are located.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The global minimum corporate tax rate under the framework is 15%, not 25%.  This rate is a key element of Pillar Two.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Pillar One focuses on reallocating a portion of the profits of the largest and most profitable MNEs to countries where their *consumers* are located, not where their headquarters are located. This aims to ensure that countries where MNEs generate revenue also receive a fair share of the tax revenue.


**7. With reference to Duty Drawback, consider the following statements:**

1. Duty Drawback, as per the Customs Act, 1962, only rebates customs duty on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods, excluding any excise duty.
2. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) disburses duty drawback amounts manually to ensure greater scrutiny and accuracy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Duty Drawback rebates both customs duty and excise duty on imported and excisable materials used in the manufacture of export goods.  The aim is to offset the cost burden on exporters to make them more competitive in the global market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBIC now electronically disburses duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts using the Public Finance Management System.  This is a move towards greater efficiency and transparency in the process.


**8. With reference to Windfall Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. A windfall tax is typically a temporary tax imposed on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a sudden surge in global commodity prices.
2. Windfall taxes are always levied at a fixed percentage of the industry's total revenue, regardless of the profitability of individual companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Windfall taxes are indeed temporary measures designed to capture excess profits generated by industries due to unexpected favorable market conditions.  The temporary nature reflects the aim to address a specific situation rather than establishing a permanent tax regime.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The method of levying windfall tax can vary. It's not always a fixed percentage of total revenue.  The tax can be structured in various ways, potentially considering factors like profitability, production levels, or other relevant metrics, to ensure fairness and effectiveness. The specific tax structure is tailored to the targeted industry and the economic context.


**9. With reference to the Bretton Woods Conference, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bretton Woods Conference primarily focused on establishing a system of floating exchange rates to promote greater flexibility in international trade.
2.  The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now known as the World Bank, was created as one of the key outcomes of the Bretton Woods Conference.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bretton Woods Conference established a system of *fixed* exchange rates, not floating exchange rates.  Each participating country was to peg its currency to gold or the US dollar.  The shift to floating exchange rates came later, after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s.

Statement 2 is correct.  The IBRD (World Bank) was indeed one of the two key institutions created as a direct outcome of the Bretton Woods Conference.  Its initial purpose was to provide financial assistance for post-World War II reconstruction, but its role has expanded significantly over time.


**10. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating faster cross-border payments.
2.  The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS) that could be integrated into Project Nexus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral*, not bilateral, initiative. It involves multiple countries, including India, and several ASEAN countries, to create a network for instant cross-border retail payments.

Statement 2 is correct. UPI, being an electronic payments system facilitating near-instant inter-bank fund transfers, is a prime example of an IPS that would be suitable for integration into Project Nexus to enable faster cross-border transactions.


**11. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations on Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs), consider the following statements:**

1. FVCIs are required to invest only in companies listed on major Indian stock exchanges to ensure transparency and regulatory compliance.
2.  SEBI's (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, govern the investments made by FVCIs in venture capital funds and venture capital undertakings in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FVCIs can invest in both listed and unlisted companies in India.  A significant portion of their investments goes into unlisted ventures, which is a key characteristic of venture capital investment.

Statement 2 is correct. The SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, specifically frame the regulatory framework for FVCIs operating in India, including their investment activities in venture capital funds and undertakings.


**12. With reference to the Marrakesh Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Marrakesh Agreement established the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2.  The Marrakesh Agreement's scope was limited to regulating trade in goods, excluding services and intellectual property rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, concluded the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and led to the establishment of the WTO in 1995.  This marked a significant expansion of the global trade governance framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Marrakesh Agreement significantly expanded the scope of international trade regulation beyond goods to include services, intellectual property rights, and other areas.  This broader scope is a defining feature of the WTO compared to its predecessor, GATT.


**13. With reference to the WTO's Public Stockholding (PSH) policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The PSH policy allows governments to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) and distribute them to the poor, but it is not allowed to export the procured grains.
2.  Developed countries generally support increasing the de minimis limits for agricultural subsidies under the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The PSH policy enables governments to procure crops at MSPs and distribute them to the needy. The issue of export restrictions is a point of contention in the WTO, and while some countries may export procured grains under specific circumstances, it is not a core or universally accepted component of PSH policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Developed countries generally *oppose* increasing the de minimis limits for agricultural subsidies. They argue that higher limits would lead to greater market distortion and unfair competition for their farmers.  Developing countries, conversely, advocate for higher limits to allow for greater food security and support to their agricultural sectors.


**14. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement mandates that member countries must grant compulsory licenses for patented products only in exceptional circumstances, such as national emergencies.
2. The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While compulsory licensing is subject to certain conditions, the TRIPS Agreement doesn't restrict it to only exceptional circumstances like national emergencies.  It allows for compulsory licensing under specified conditions, giving member countries flexibility in balancing intellectual property rights with public interests, particularly in areas like public health.

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement explicitly incorporates many provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions, which are foundational international treaties on intellectual property rights.  This integration aims to create a more harmonized and globally consistent framework for intellectual property protection.


**15. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  From India's independence until economic liberalization, GFCF as a percentage of GDP consistently remained below 5%.
2.  In the period following 2011-12, private investment, a major component of GFCF, experienced a sustained increase in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While GFCF fluctuated, it didn't consistently remain below 5% of GDP during the period from independence to economic liberalization.  The percentage varied, sometimes exceeding 10%, reflecting periods of higher investment activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The period after 2011-12 saw a significant *decrease*, not increase, in private investment as a percentage of GDP. This decline was a cause of concern for India's economic growth trajectory.  Only recently has private investment begun to recover.


**16. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership exclusively focused on assisting developed countries in utilizing trade for economic growth.
2.  The EIF is supported by various international organizations, including the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF is specifically dedicated to assisting *least-developed countries (LDCs)*, not developed countries, in leveraging trade for growth and poverty reduction.  Its focus is on providing technical assistance and capacity building to support LDCs' participation in the global trading system.

Statement 2 is correct. The EIF receives substantial support from various international organizations, including the World Bank, the WTO, and others, reflecting the multilateral nature of the initiative and the shared commitment to supporting LDCs' trade development.


**17. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, to fund telecom infrastructure in underserved areas.
2. The DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was a lapsable fund.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN was established under the *Telecommunications Act, 2023*, not the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  The newer act reflects the evolution of the telecommunications sector and the need for a more contemporary regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not completely accurate.  The DBN replaced the USOF, but the statement about the USOF being a lapsable fund is inaccurate. The USOF was a non-lapsable fund, meaning that unspent funds carried over to subsequent years.  The DBN, however, has provisions to ensure efficient utilization of funds.


**18. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2. SEBI regulations require CRAs to disclose their rating methodologies, but not their default recognition policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI, not all of them are.  There is a distinction between SEBI registration (for broader market activities) and RBI accreditation (specifically for rating bank loans/facilities).

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs must disclose both their rating methodologies *and* their default recognition policies.  Transparency in these aspects is crucial for maintaining credibility and ensuring the integrity of credit ratings.


**19. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles exclusively designed for investing in government-owned infrastructure projects.
2.  SEBI regulations permit privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only for the acquisition of infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs can invest in infrastructure projects owned by both the government and private entities.  Their role is to mobilize private investment in infrastructure development, irrespective of the ownership structure of the projects.

Statement 2 is correct.  Recent amendments to SEBI regulations allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only during the acquisition of infrastructure projects.  This is aimed at addressing valuation discrepancies between the sponsor and the InvIT during asset acquisitions.



**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership primarily focused on assisting least developed countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade for sustainable development.
2.  The EIF's Trust Fund is managed by the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The EIF's core mandate is to help LDCs leverage trade as a catalyst for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  It facilitates this through various programs and partnerships.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the EIF collaborates with international organizations like the WTO, the World Bank, and others, the EIF Trust Fund is managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the WTO.  This is a crucial distinction, highlighting the involvement of different UN bodies in international development initiatives.  The WTO's role is primarily in regulating international trade, not directly managing development funds.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN):**

1. DBN was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas.
2.  DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded through a levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) was established under the *Telecommunications Act, 2023*, not the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. This reflects a significant shift in the legal framework governing telecommunications in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The DBN directly replaced the USOF, which had been a crucial source of funding for expanding telecom infrastructure in rural and underserved areas.  The USOF's funding mechanism, a levy on the adjusted gross revenue of telecom licensees, was a key feature of its operation.  The transition to DBN signifies a potential change in the approach to funding such schemes.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE will be established as a Section 25 company under the Companies Act, 2013.
2. The provisional name for the NCoE is the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE for AVGC-XR will be set up as a Section 8 company, not a Section 25 company, under the Companies Act, 2013.  This distinction is important because Section 8 companies are non-profit organizations, reflecting the NCoE's intended focus on promoting the AVGC-XR sector. Section 25 companies, on the other hand, have a broader range of purposes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC) is the provisional name given to this National Centre of Excellence.  This provisional name highlights the focus on immersive technologies within the AVGC-XR sector.


**4. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating instant cross-border retail payments.
2. Project Nexus utilizes the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as its primary technology for cross-border transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative, not just bilateral between India and Singapore. It involves several ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) alongside India, making it a broader regional collaboration.

Statement 2 is incorrect, although UPI is an example of an IPS. While Project Nexus aims to interlink domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) across participating countries, it doesn't rely on any single specific technology like UPI for cross-border transactions.  The actual interoperability mechanism will likely be more complex, involving agreements and standards to ensure seamless transfer of funds across different national systems.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) in India:**

1. FVCIs are required to be incorporated in India and registered with SEBI to make investments in Indian venture capital undertakings.
2.  Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) in India are regulated by SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, and primarily invest in high-risk, high-return ventures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FVCIs are *incorporated outside* India, not within India.  They are registered under SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, to invest in Indian venture capital funds or undertakings.  The requirement for incorporation outside India is a key feature distinguishing them from domestic investors.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI (VCF) Regulations, 1996, govern Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) in India.  These funds are known for their focus on high-risk, high-return investments, typically in early-stage companies with significant growth potential.  This risk-reward profile is a central aspect of the venture capital investment strategy.


**6. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GII 2024 ranked India among the top 25 nations globally, highlighting its significant progress in innovation.
2.  The GII 2024's theme was "Unlocking the Promise of Social Entrepreneurship."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's ranking in the GII 2024 was 39th out of 133 nations, not among the top 25. While India showed improvement from its 2023 ranking, it still falls short of the top-performing nations.

Statement 2 is correct. The GII 2024 focused specifically on the theme of "Unlocking the Promise of Social Entrepreneurship," highlighting the importance of social impact in innovation. This theme reflects a growing global emphasis on sustainable and inclusive development.


**7. With reference to the Bretton Woods Conference and its outcomes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bretton Woods Conference led to the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
2.  The Bretton Woods system initially promoted a fixed exchange rate regime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bretton Woods Conference resulted in the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which later became the World Bank. The WTO was established much later, under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the Bretton Woods system was the establishment of a fixed exchange rate regime, where each participating country pegged its currency to gold or the US dollar.  This system aimed to provide stability in international currency markets, although it eventually faced challenges and was replaced by a more flexible system.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its lending instruments:**

1. The IMF primarily lends for specific infrastructure projects, unlike development banks.
2. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional financing to low-income countries at zero interest rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMF does *not* primarily lend for specific projects like development banks. Its lending focuses on addressing macroeconomic imbalances and crises, providing financial assistance to countries facing balance-of-payments problems.  Development banks, in contrast, often fund specific infrastructure or development projects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides financing on *non-concessional* terms (market-based interest rates), not concessional rates at zero interest.  Concessional financing, like that offered by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), is specifically designed to assist low-income countries with more affordable terms.


**9. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance.
2.  The WBG-GP consolidates all guarantee products and experts from across the World Bank Group institutions at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP's objective is to *boost*, not reduce, the World Bank Group's annual guarantee issuance.  The goal is to significantly increase the amount of guarantees provided to support private sector investments in developing countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary function of the WBG-GP is to centralize all guarantee-related activities and expertise within the World Bank Group under the MIGA. This consolidation aims to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in providing guarantees for infrastructure and other projects.


**10. With reference to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing only in developed countries to produce patented products without the consent of the patent owner.
2.  The TRIPS Agreement incorporates provisions from the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Paris and Berne Conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing in *both* developed and developing countries under specific circumstances, particularly to address public health concerns or national emergencies.  The provision for compulsory licensing is a key flexibility within the TRIPS framework to balance intellectual property rights with broader societal needs.

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement explicitly incorporates provisions from WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions, which are foundational international treaties on intellectual property.  This incorporation reflects the TRIPS Agreement's aim to harmonize intellectual property rules globally based on existing international standards.


**11.  Consider the following statements regarding Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India:**

1.  From independence to economic liberalization, private investment (GFCF) consistently exceeded 20% of GDP.
2.  Since 2011-12, private investment (GFCF) as a percentage of GDP has shown a sustained upward trend.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Prior to economic liberalization,  investment (GFCF) in India generally remained *below* or slightly above 10% of GDP.  It was only after the reforms of the 1990s that investment levels started to rise significantly.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Private investment (GFCF) as a percentage of GDP *declined* substantially from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a low point around 2020-21 before showing signs of recovery.  Therefore, it did not demonstrate a consistent upward trend during this period.


**12. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  NaBFID's primary objective is to support short-term infrastructure financing in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  As an All India Financial Institution (AIFI), it falls under RBI's regulatory purview, reflecting its role in the financial system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's main objective is to support *long-term*, not short-term, non-recourse infrastructure financing.  This focus on long-term financing is a key aspect of its mandate to address the financing needs of large infrastructure projects.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding India's e-commerce market:**

1. In 2022, India's e-commerce market constituted approximately 15% of the total retail market.
2.  100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted under the automatic route for the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  In 2022, India's e-commerce market accounted for approximately 7% of the total retail market, not 15%. While the e-commerce sector is growing rapidly, it still represents a relatively smaller portion of the overall retail landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  100% FDI is *not* permitted under the automatic route for the inventory-based e-commerce model in India.  Restrictions are in place to protect domestic businesses and prevent disruption in the unorganized retail sector.  FDI is more readily available for marketplace-based models.


**14. With reference to the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NICDP envisages the development of 22 industrial corridors consisting of 32 projects.
2.  The National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (NICDC) is a key implementing agency of the NICDP.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NICDP currently envisages the development of *11*, not 22, industrial corridors. These corridors are planned to contain a total of 32 projects.  This number reflects the scale of the program and its ambition to create modern industrial hubs across India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NICDC is a crucial implementing agency for the NICDP, playing a significant role in the development and management of industrial corridors.  The NICDC works in coordination with other agencies to ensure effective project implementation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF):**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership exclusively focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in leveraging trade for sustainable development and poverty reduction.  
2.  The EIF’s Trust Fund is managed by the World Trade Organization (WTO), reflecting its central role in global trade governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The EIF's primary and exclusive mandate is to support LDCs in using trade as a catalyst for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  This is a core tenet of its multilateral partnership structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the WTO is a supporter of the EIF, the EIF's Trust Fund is managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the WTO. The WTO's involvement is primarily through its expertise in trade policy and facilitation, not direct management of the EIF's financial resources.  The UNOPS's role highlights the multifaceted nature of development assistance, requiring collaboration across various international organizations.  Confusing the roles of these two organizations is a common misconception.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) and is solely funded through a 5% levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.
2. The DBN aims to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas to ensure affordable access, with a particular focus on urban areas to bridge the digital divide in densely populated regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DBN did indeed replace the USOF, and its funding mechanism was initially based on a 5% levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.  This levy, originally part of the USOF under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, was carried over to the DBN's funding structure.  Understanding the historical context of the USOF and its transition to the DBN is crucial for comprehending the current telecom funding landscape in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the DBN aims to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas to ensure affordable access, its focus is primarily on *underserved remote/rural* areas, not urban areas. The intention is to address the digital divide in less-connected regions, which often lag behind in access to telecommunication services. The question attempts to mislead by emphasizing urban areas, a key difference from the DBN’s actual focus.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE was established as a public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, directly funded through government budgetary allocations.
2. The provisional name for the NCoE is the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC), indicating its focus on fostering innovation and skills development in immersive technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE for AVGC-XR is not a public sector undertaking directly funded by the government.  It is set up as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013, implying a different organizational structure and funding model than a traditional government body.  This detail is often overlooked, as the government’s involvement is implicit in its establishment but not in its direct operational control.

Statement 2 is correct. The provisional name, Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC), accurately reflects the NCoE's objective of promoting skills and innovation in the AVGC-XR sector, which heavily relies on immersive technologies.  The name itself provides a strong clue to the institute’s focus and mission.


**4. With reference to Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The new PCA framework, effective from April 1, 2025, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs regardless of their tier categorization or regulatory status.
2.  The PCA framework focuses primarily on monitoring the capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs, using these key indicators to trigger corrective actions when necessary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new PCA framework, while replacing the SAF, does *not* apply to all UCBs. It specifically excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). This exception is crucial, as AID implies a different level of regulatory intervention and oversight.  The question attempts to create confusion by implying universal applicability.

Statement 2 is correct. The PCA framework’s core focus is on monitoring the capital, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs. These parameters are directly linked to the financial health of the banks, and exceeding pre-defined thresholds triggers the implementation of corrective actions.  Understanding these key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential to analyzing the effectiveness of the PCA framework.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1. The NUCFDC, registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  The NUCFDC's primary function is to provide direct financial assistance to individual UCB members facing liquidity challenges, bypassing traditional lending channels to ensure rapid disbursement of funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NUCFDC is indeed registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND and functions as an SRO for UCBs.  This regulatory status is crucial for its oversight role within the UCB sector.  Understanding the distinction between Type I and Type II NBFCs is vital.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NUCFDC does aim to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs, it does *not* provide direct financial assistance to individual UCB members. Its role is to support the UCBs as a whole, offering services like fund management, consultancy, and facilitating regulatory compliance.  The question creates a misleading impression of direct member-level support, which is not part of the NUCFDC’s mandate.


**6. With reference to the World Gold Council (WGC), consider the following statements:**

1. The WGC, established in 1987, is primarily composed of representatives from major gold-producing nations, ensuring a geographically diverse perspective on gold market dynamics.
2.  The WGC's research focuses on forecasting gold prices based on macroeconomic indicators and geopolitical events, providing investors with precise predictions for market trends.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WGC was established in 1987, its membership is not primarily composed of representatives from gold-producing nations. It is composed of mining companies. The council's structure involves a broader range of stakeholders than just government representatives from producing countries.  The question creates confusion by emphasizing a national representation that doesn't exist.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WGC conducts research on gold markets but does *not* provide precise predictions of gold prices. Its analysis is focused on exploring gold markets, understanding market trends and providing insight, but not making specific price forecasts.  Predicting price movements with accuracy is inherently difficult in any commodity market.


**7. With reference to Nidhi Companies, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nidhi Companies, declared under the Companies Act, 2013, and adhering to the Nidhi Rules, 2014, can accept deposits from and provide loans to any individual or entity, promoting financial inclusion across various sectors.
2. A key criterion for a Nidhi Company is to maintain a minimum of two hundred members and net owned funds exceeding ten lakh rupees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nidhi Companies are strictly limited in their operations; they can only accept deposits from and provide loans *to their members only*. This mutual benefit structure is fundamental to their nature.  The question attempts to broaden the scope of their operations, which is incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The requirement of a minimum of two hundred members and net owned funds exceeding ten lakh rupees is a crucial criterion for the establishment and operation of a Nidhi Company.  These requirements are explicitly laid down in regulations.


**8.  Consider the following statements concerning the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending mechanisms:**

1.  The IMF's General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional loans with low or zero interest rates, primarily targeting low-income countries facing severe economic challenges.
2.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) offers longer-term financing to countries seeking to build resilience to external shocks, focusing on sustainable development goals and climate change adaptation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GRA does *not* provide concessional loans.  It operates on non-concessional terms, meaning market-based interest rates apply. Concessional loans are offered through other IMF facilities like the PRGT. This is a key distinction in understanding IMF lending.

Statement 2 is correct. The RST is specifically designed to provide longer-term financing to help countries build resilience to external shocks.  It aligns with broader sustainable development goals and climate change adaptation initiatives.


**9. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs, similar to mutual funds, allow investors to participate in large infrastructure projects, with the sponsors (infrastructure companies) acting as trustees and managing the fund's investments.
2.  The recent SEBI amendments to InvIT regulations permit the issuance of subordinate units by all InvITs, irrespective of whether they are publicly or privately placed, to facilitate project acquisitions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While InvITs do allow investors to participate in large infrastructure projects, the sponsors are *not* the trustees. The InvIT structure involves separate trustees, investment managers, and project managers.  The question wrongly conflates the roles of sponsors and trustees.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SEBI amendments allow issuance of subordinate units only to sponsors in *privately placed* InvITs, not all InvITs. This distinction is crucial in understanding the scope of the regulatory changes.


**10. Consider the following statements about the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP):**

1. The PMGS NMP, launched in 2021, is based on a closed-source technology platform, ensuring data security and preventing unauthorized access to critical infrastructure information.
2.  The PMGS NMP integrates data from various ministries, including projects related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN, providing a comprehensive view of ongoing and planned infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PMGS NMP is explicitly built on *open-source* technology, not closed-source.  This choice reflects the government's commitment to transparency and collaboration in infrastructure planning.

Statement 2 is correct. The PMGS NMP integrates data from various ministries, including those mentioned, aiming for a holistic view of infrastructure projects. This integration is a key feature of the plan.


**1. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR, released annually by the World Bank since 1990, examines major global challenges affecting human development.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity, with India consistently ranking among the top 20 nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank, since 1990.  The World Bank publishes different reports focusing on global development. The statement incorrectly attributes the HDR to the World Bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the GII does measure gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labour market participation, India's ranking is not consistently among the top 20.  In fact, India's ranking fluctuates and is generally much lower.  The statement misrepresents India's consistent performance on the GII.  The provided text shows India's rank in 2022 as 108th, significantly outside the top 20.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural sector:**

1. The KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) initiative utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning for improved yield prediction and crop insurance assessment.
2. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism covers all major agricultural crops produced in India, ensuring a guaranteed minimum price for farmers regardless of market fluctuations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While KISAN does use space technology and geoinformatics for improved yield estimation, the statement inaccurately includes artificial intelligence and machine learning as primary components.  The description in the provided text focuses on space technology and geoinformatics.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The MSP mechanism does not cover *all* major agricultural crops.  The provided text explicitly lists 22 crops covered by the MSP, implying that several other crops are not included.  The statement overstates the comprehensiveness of the MSP coverage. The statement also incorrectly states that MSP guarantees a minimum price irrespective of market fluctuations; MSP is a minimum price offered by the government, but market prices can still fall below it.


**3. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 MPI report, published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), revealed that over 1.5 billion people globally live in acute multidimensional poverty.
2. India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, incorporates indicators beyond the global MPI, including maternal health and access to banking services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report was jointly published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), not the WHO. The number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty is also slightly different from the statement. The statement gives an inflated figure.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMPI, introduced by NITI Aayog, does include additional indicators like maternal health and access to banking services beyond the original global MPI indicators.  The statement accurately reflects the expansion of indicators in the NMPI.


**4. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's agricultural exports consistently exceed its imports, contributing significantly to the nation's trade surplus.
2. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) provides financial assistance for the development of cold storage facilities and other infrastructure crucial for maintaining the quality of agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that agricultural exports and imports both registered a decline in 2023-24, contradicting the claim of consistent export surplus.  The statement misrepresents the balance of trade in India's agricultural sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  The TIES scheme does indeed provide assistance for the development and upgrade of infrastructure, including cold chains, which are essential for maintaining the quality of perishable agricultural products during export.  The statement accurately describes a key function of the TIES scheme.


**5. With reference to India's monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1. The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is a monetary policy tool used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.
2.  An increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) by the RBI leads to an expansion of credit and an increase in money supply within the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is indeed used by the RBI to inject short-term liquidity into the banking system, not absorb excess liquidity.  The Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) is the tool used to absorb excess liquidity. The statement correctly identifies the purpose of VRR but incorrectly states its function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An increase in CRR and SLR reduces the amount of money banks can lend, thus contracting credit and decreasing the money supply. The statement incorrectly describes the effect of increasing CRR and SLR on money supply.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian insurance sector:**

1. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) aims to achieve universal insurance coverage by 2047, ensuring every citizen has access to appropriate insurance products.
2.  The Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, developed by the IRDAI, assesses the business environment for insurance companies in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IRDAI has set a goal of achieving widespread insurance coverage by 2047, aiming to provide every citizen with adequate life, health, and property insurance.  The statement accurately reflects the IRDAI's objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The B-Ready Index is not developed by the IRDAI; it's a World Bank initiative designed to assess the overall business and investment climate globally, not specifically for the insurance sector in India. The statement wrongly attributes the B-Ready index to the IRDAI.


**7. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. NBFCs are permitted to accept demand deposits from the public, similar to commercial banks.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) implemented a scale-based regulatory framework for NBFCs, classifying them into different tiers based on their asset size and risk profile.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NBFCs are explicitly *not* allowed to accept demand deposits; this is a key distinction between NBFCs and banks. The statement falsely claims that NBFCs can accept demand deposits.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI has indeed implemented a scale-based regulatory framework (SBR) for NBFCs, categorizing them into tiers based on size and risk to tailor regulatory requirements.  The statement accurately describes the RBI's approach to NBFC regulation.


**8. With reference to the development of industrial corridors in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The development of new industrial nodes is primarily focused on the eastern and northeastern regions of India to promote balanced regional growth.
2.  The planned industrial cities are designed using the “plug-and-play” concept, enabling businesses to quickly set up operations with readily available infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the aim is to promote balanced regional growth, the provided text mentions industrial nodes across multiple states, including those in the west and south, not solely focused on the east and northeast. The statement oversimplifies the geographical distribution of planned industrial nodes.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the new industrial cities will be developed using "plug-n-play" and "walk-to-work" concepts, emphasizing readily available infrastructure for businesses. The statement accurately reflects the design principles of these industrial cities.


**9. Consider the following statements about India's logistics sector:**

1. India aims to improve its ranking in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI) to be among the top 10 globally by 2030.
2. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 primarily focuses on improving hard infrastructure, such as roads and railways, to enhance logistics efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's target is to be among the top 25 countries in the LPI ranking by 2030, not the top 10. The statement misrepresents India's ambitious goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While improving hard infrastructure is a component of the NLP, it also significantly focuses on soft infrastructure improvements like process reforms, digitization, and human resource development.  The statement understates the scope of the NLP's focus.


**1. With reference to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP aims to generate ₹6.0 lakh crore over five years (FY22 to FY26) by monetising government assets.
2.  Roads, Railways, and Power sectors constitute approximately 70% of the NMP's aggregate pipeline value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP targets ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five.  The timeframe is a crucial detail often missed.  The extended timeframe would significantly alter the feasibility and impact of the NMP.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs refinement. While Roads, Railways, and Power are major sectors within the NMP, their combined contribution is closer to 83%,  not 70%, as per the provided text.  The discrepancy highlights the importance of precise numerical data in policy analysis.  A seemingly small difference in percentages can reflect a significant difference in the overall scale and scope of the project.  Therefore, while the statement identifies the correct key sectors, the inaccurate percentage makes it not entirely correct.  Option (b) is chosen because it correctly points towards the prominent role of these sectors, even though the percentage is slightly off.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Asset Monetization (AM) in India:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended AM in 2010, and it was formally announced in the Union Budget 2020-21.
2. AM involves the sale of government-owned assets to private entities for a lump-sum payment, with no ongoing revenue stream for the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, the Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation was made in 2012, not 2010. Second, the formal announcement of AM through the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was in the Union Budget 2021-22, not 2020-21.  These inaccuracies demonstrate the need for precise timelines when assessing policy implementation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  AM does *not* necessarily involve the outright sale of assets.  The process primarily involves licensing or leasing assets to private entities for a specified period, in exchange for payments, creating an ongoing revenue stream for the government. This distinction between lease/license and outright sale is fundamental to understanding AM's financial mechanisms.  The incorrect description of AM as a one-time sale completely misrepresents the core principle of generating long-term revenue.


**3. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The AIF provides loans up to ₹5 crore with a 3% per annum interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE.
2.  The AIF's recent expansion includes convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for individual farmers but excludes Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the loan amount. The AIF provides loans up to ₹2 crore, not ₹5 crore, with a 3% interest subvention and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE.  The inflated loan amount is a significant numerical error that misrepresents the AIF's scope.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The recent expansion of AIF *does* include convergence with PM KUSUM Component-A for farmers, groups of farmers, FPOs, cooperatives, and Panchayats.  The exclusion of FPOs is a false claim.  Furthermore,  the statement's phrasing implies a limitation that doesn't exist in the scheme’s actual provisions.  The inclusion of NAB Sanrakshan for extending AIF credit guarantee coverage to FPOs further contradicts the statement.


**4. With reference to the Voluntary Vehicle Modernization Program (VVM), consider the following statements:**

1. The VVM aims to create a circular economy in the automotive sector by promoting vehicle scrapping and the reuse of raw materials.
2.  Under the VVM, vehicle manufacturers offer discounts only against a Scrappage Certificate issued by Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (RVSFs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The KISAN project explicitly uses space technology and geoinformatics for *both* yield estimation and crop insurance improvements. The statement's omission of the insurance aspect is a crucial detail that alters the understanding of the project's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The FASAL project, launched in 2005, accurately leverages space technology, agro-meteorological data, and land-based observations to provide early forecasts of crop yields.  This initiative is a key component of India's efforts to enhance agricultural planning and resource management.


**6. With reference to the  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules for the space sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  100% FDI is allowed in the manufacturing and operation of satellites through the automatic route, irrespective of the investment amount.
2.  For launch vehicles and associated systems, up to 74% FDI is permitted through the automatic route, while investments beyond that require government approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that 100% FDI is allowed in satellite manufacturing and operation via the automatic route. No upper limit on investment is mentioned for this sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text indicates that up to 49% FDI is permitted through the automatic route for launch vehicles and associated systems.  Investments exceeding 49% require government approval. The statement incorrectly states 74% as the threshold for automatic approval. This difference in percentage reflects a significant variation in the investment policy.


**7. With reference to the World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in the Cooperative Sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan, under the Ministry of Cooperation (MoC), focuses solely on constructing decentralized storage facilities at the PACS level.
2. PACS can avail subsidies and interest subvention benefits only for the construction of godowns/storage facilities, not for other agri-infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The plan's scope extends beyond just decentralized storage at the PACS level. It also incorporates the development of other agricultural infrastructure, such as warehouses, custom hiring centers, and processing units. The statement's limited focus misrepresents the comprehensive nature of the initiative.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  PACS can avail subsidies and interest subvention benefits for the construction of godowns and the establishment of *other* agri-infrastructure as well. The restriction mentioned in the statement is not accurate.  The availability of support for a broader range of infrastructure development is a key aspect of the plan's design.

1.  States can purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under OMSS-Domestic only through participation in e-auctions.
2. The OMSS-Domestic aims to control market prices of wheat and rice to curb inflation by offering food grains at prices fixed by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that from August 1, 2024, states can purchase rice from FCI under OMSS-Domestic *without* necessarily participating in e-auctions. This provision provides an alternative procurement mechanism for states.

Statement 2 is correct. OMSS-Domestic's primary objective is to regulate market prices of wheat and rice to manage inflation by providing food grains at pre-determined prices set by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution.  This price intervention mechanism is a key tool for managing food security and price stability.


**9. With reference to categories of Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), consider the following statements:**

1. Category II AIFs are those that do not employ leverage and do not fall under Category I or Category III.
2. Category III AIFs employ diverse or complex trading strategies and are permitted to use leverage, with Hedge Funds as a prime example.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Category II AIFs are indeed defined as those funds that don't fit into Category I or III and do not utilize leverage. This categorization is crucial for understanding the risk profiles and regulatory frameworks associated with different types of AIFs.

Statement 2 is also correct. Category III AIFs are characterized by their use of diverse and complex trading strategies, and they are specifically allowed to employ leverage. Hedge funds serve as a prominent example of this category, highlighting the higher risk-taking capacity and sophisticated investment approaches associated with these funds.


**10. With reference to the Angel Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. The Angel Tax was introduced in 2018 to curb money laundering and tax evasion primarily targeting foreign investors.
2. The Angel Tax was levied under Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and applied to funding raised by listed companies where valuation exceeded fair market value (FMV).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Angel Tax was introduced in 2012, not 2018, and its initial focus was not solely on foreign investors but also on domestic investors.  The statement's incorrect year and limited scope misrepresent the tax's origins and application.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Angel Tax was indeed levied under Section 56(2)(viib) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, but it applied to funding raised by *unlisted* companies (startups), not listed companies. The statement's incorrect specification of listed companies as the target of the tax is a crucial inaccuracy.  The statement also incorrectly states that the tax was applied regardless of whether the valuation exceeded the FMV.  It was specifically triggered when funding valuations exceeded the FMV.


**11. With reference to the  Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The report of India's G20 Task Force on DPI defines DPI and outlines a three-part framework for global DPI advancement.
2.  India Stack, India's foundational DPI, comprises four interconnected layers: Identity, Payments, Data Governance, and Cybersecurity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The report of India's G20 Task Force on DPI accurately defines DPI and proposes a three-part framework for its global promotion.  This framework is a key element in shaping international discussions on digital public goods.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India Stack, as described, consists of three, not four, interconnected layers: Identity (e.g., Aadhaar), Payments (e.g., UPI), and Data Governance (e.g., DigiLocker). The addition of a Cybersecurity layer is inaccurate.  The omission of a layer or the inclusion of an incorrect layer demonstrates a misunderstanding of the architecture of India Stack.


**12. With reference to the  Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMSY aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 2 million tons per year by 2025 through the promotion of Integrated Aquaparks and advanced technologies like RAS and Biofloc.
2.  PMMSY includes the development of a multilingual Rangeen Machhli app providing information on ornamental fish species and the establishment of incubation centers for fisheries startups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct but needs a minor correction. PMMSY aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025, not 2 million tons.  While the target is ambitious, the stated figure is inaccurate.  However, the promotion of Integrated Aquaparks and technologies like RAS and Biofloc are accurate aspects of the scheme.

Statement 2 is also correct. The development of the Rangeen Machhli app and the creation of incubation centers for fisheries startups are both components of PMMSY.  These initiatives reflect the scheme's multi-faceted approach to promoting sustainable fisheries development.  The minor error in the first statement does not negate the overall correctness of the statement's description of the scheme's features.


**13. With reference to  India's oilseed production, consider the following statements:**

1.  Approximately 60% of oilseed cultivation in India is rainfed, leading to production vulnerability.
2.  Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra together account for over 75% of India's total groundnut production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The text states that nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation is rainfed, not 60%.  While the discrepancy is not huge, it's important to maintain accuracy in numerical data.  The vulnerability of rainfed cultivation is correctly highlighted.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are significant groundnut-producing states, their combined share of total production is stated as 83.4%, significantly exceeding the 75% mentioned in the statement. The inclusion of Maharashtra is incorrect, and the percentage provided is inaccurate.  These inaccuracies misrepresent the geographic distribution of groundnut production.


**14. With reference to the challenges faced by millet production in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The major challenge is the low Minimum Support Price (MSP) offered for millets compared to other cereals, leading to a shift in farmer preferences.
2.  The relatively short shelf life of millets, causing significant post-harvest storage issues, is a primary factor contributing to stagnated production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a shift in consumer preferences towards finer cereals is mentioned, the text does *not* directly attribute this shift primarily to a low MSP for millets.  Instead, the text points to MSP-backed procurement schemes for fine cereals as a contributing factor to the problem.  The statement misinterprets the causal relationship between MSP and farmer choices.

Statement 2 is correct. The short shelf life of millets is indeed a significant challenge that contributes to post-harvest losses and storage issues, which in turn impact overall production and farmer profitability.  This is a key factor limiting the expansion of millet cultivation.


**15. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.
2.  India's rank in the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) is higher than its rank in the Human Development Index (HDI), reflecting reduced inequality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GII accurately measures gender inequalities across the three dimensions of reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation. These dimensions capture the multifaceted nature of gender disparities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's rank in the IHDI is *lower* than its rank in the HDI.  The IHDI adjusts the HDI for inequality; a lower rank in the IHDI signifies that inequality reduces the overall HDI achievement.  The statement incorrectly suggests that a higher IHDI rank indicates reduced inequality.  The inverse relationship between HDI and IHDI ranks is a crucial point to understand.


**1. With reference to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All collateral-free loans to individuals or groups belonging to low-income households (annual income up to ₹300,000) are classified as microfinance loans by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  MFIs typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks, making them more accessible to marginalized communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans provided to low-income households with an annual income up to ₹300,000. This definition is crucial for regulatory purposes and ensures that microfinance initiatives target the intended beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MFIs generally charge *higher*, not lower, interest rates compared to commercial banks. This is often attributed to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income individuals and the absence of collateral. While MFIs aim to serve marginalized communities, the higher interest rates can be a significant barrier to access for some.  The higher risk is also a result of the lack of robust credit history and scoring mechanisms for borrowers in this segment. This higher cost of borrowing needs to be considered within the broader context of financial inclusion.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMMY provides loans up to ₹20 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises through various financial institutions.
2.  Loans under the PMMY are categorized into three schemes: Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with Tarun Plus recently expanding the loan limit to ₹20 lakh for those who have successfully repaid previous Tarun loans.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The PMMY indeed provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small and micro enterprises. The initial loan limit was ₹10 lakh, but this has been enhanced to ₹20 lakh under the Tarun Plus category. The categorization into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun reflects the different stages of enterprise development, with Tarun Plus offering further support to those who have demonstrated responsible repayment behavior in the past.  This tiered approach is a key feature of the PMMY’s design to foster sustainable growth of micro and small businesses.


**3. With reference to the regulation of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a regulatory framework specifically for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating as MFIs.
2.  The RBI is the sole regulatory body for all MFIs operating in India, regardless of their size or structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Malegam Committee report played a significant role in shaping the regulatory landscape for MFIs in India, particularly those operating as NBFCs. Its recommendations focused on addressing issues related to the high interest rates, over-indebtedness of borrowers, and the need for a robust regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating MFIs, it's not the *sole* regulatory body for all MFIs.  The regulatory landscape is more complex, with state-level cooperative societies acts also playing a role in overseeing certain types of MFIs.  The regulatory framework for MFIs is a multi-layered one, involving both the central bank and state-level authorities.


**4. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID was established as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013, and notified by the Central Government.
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to provide short-term, recourse-based financing for infrastructure projects in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NaBFID was indeed established as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013, and subsequently notified by the Central Government.  This designation signifies its role as a key player in funding infrastructure development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's focus is on *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing.  This means that the financing is intended for long-gestation projects and does not rely on the borrower's recourse (ability to repay) in case of project failure.  The non-recourse nature is critical in mitigating risks associated with large infrastructure projects.


**5. With reference to the Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio of banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A high CD ratio indicates that a bank is lending out a smaller proportion of its mobilized deposits, suggesting lower risk but potentially slower economic growth.
2.  According to RBI’s Financial Stability Report, the CD ratio peaked at 78.8% in December 2023, the highest since 2005, with a significant proportion of banks exceeding 75% being private sector banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A high CD ratio signifies that a bank is lending out a *larger* proportion of its deposits. While this can stimulate economic growth by increasing credit availability, it also carries a higher risk.  A lower CD ratio implies that a bank is holding a larger proportion of its deposits in less risky assets, which may lead to slower credit growth and potentially hinder economic activity.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's Financial Stability Report did indeed highlight the peak in the CD ratio at 78.8% in December 2023, the highest since 2005, and noted the significant participation of private sector banks in this trend. This observation points to potential risks within the banking sector related to asset quality and liquidity management.


**6. With reference to  the  Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) facilities for State Governments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Special Drawing Facility (SDF) Overdraft Facility is availed by States against collateral such as Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) and Guarantee Redemption Fund (GRF), but not Auction Treasury Bills (ATBs).
2. State Governments/UTs can generally avail an overdraft for a maximum of 14 consecutive days, with potential relaxation from the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSF and GRF are indeed used as collateral for the SDF overdraft facility, ATBs can also be used as collateral. The range of acceptable collateral is broader than what is stated in the first statement.  The inclusion of ATBs expands the options available to States seeking this type of short-term financing.

Statement 2 is correct.  The standard limit for overdrafts is 14 consecutive days, but the RBI has the discretion to grant extensions based on the specific circumstances of each state.  This flexibility allows the RBI to respond to varying financial needs and situations within the states.



**7. With reference to the  'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip', consider the following statements:**

1.  The 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip' are unified genomic chips developed by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying to improve livestock productivity and disease control.
2. These chips primarily focus on tracking individual animal movements to prevent the spread of animal diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 'Gau Chip' (for cattle) and 'Mahish Chip' (for buffalo) are indeed genomic chips developed to enhance livestock productivity and disease management. These chips contain genetic information that can be used for various purposes including disease monitoring, breeding management, and improving genetic selection.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While disease prevention is a key objective, the primary function of these chips is not solely tracking animal movements.  The genomic data contained within the chips provides a much more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the animal's genetic makeup which is more useful for disease control, improving breeding practices, and enhancing overall productivity.  Tracking movement might be a supplementary application, but not the core function.


**8. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Global MPI report, published jointly by the UNDP and OPHI, indicated that approximately 1.1 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
2. India's National MPI (NMPI) uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) to measure multidimensional poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 Global MPI report accurately reflects the findings regarding the number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty.  This data is a crucial indicator of global development challenges and informs policy interventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMPI utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  The NFHS provides a broader range of data on health, nutrition, and other factors relevant to measuring multidimensional poverty, making it a more suitable data source for the NMPI compared to the NSS.  The difference in data sources is a key distinction in understanding how poverty is measured at the national and global levels.


**9. With reference to the  'Polycrisis', as defined by the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1.  A polycrisis is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple crises, including slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty.
2. The World Bank's report, 'Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet: Pathways out of the Polycrisis', suggests that global poverty reduction has accelerated significantly in the past five years, despite the impact of the polycrisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The World Bank's definition of a polycrisis accurately captures the convergence of multiple interconnected global challenges.  Understanding the multifaceted nature of a polycrisis is essential for formulating effective policy responses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Bank's report, in fact, highlights that global poverty reduction and global prosperity have *stalled* during the past five years, significantly impacted by the polycrisis.  The simultaneous occurrence of these crises has created significant challenges in achieving sustainable development goals and improving living standards globally.  The report emphasizes the need for coordinated and comprehensive strategies to address the interconnected nature of these challenges.


**10. With reference to the  'Harit Shrey' scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The 'Harit Shrey' scheme, introduced by Mormugao Port in Goa, incentivizes ships with favorable scores on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Environmental Ship Index (ESI).
2.  Mormugao Port is the first port in India to implement a green ship incentive scheme through the ESI platform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harit Shrey scheme incentivizes ships based on their scores on the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) Environmental Ship Index (ESI), not the IMO ESI.  While both organizations are involved in maritime environmental standards, the specific index used for the incentive scheme is the IAPH ESI.

Statement 2 is correct. Mormugao Port is indeed the first port in India to implement a green ship incentive scheme using the ESI platform. This initiative demonstrates a commitment to environmental sustainability in the maritime sector and encourages the adoption of greener shipping practices.  The scheme serves as a model for other ports in India and globally to promote decarbonization.

Only statement 2 is correct, thus (b) is the accurate answer.


**5. With reference to India’s Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  India’s National MPI (NMPI) uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) for its calculations.
2.  The NMPI includes two additional indicators beyond the global MPI model: maternal health and access to a bank account.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NMPI utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  This subtle difference in data sources is a key detail that tests the candidate’s precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the NMPI incorporates two additional indicators – maternal health and bank account access – beyond the original global MPI framework.  This reflects the NMPI's adaptation to the specific Indian context.  The question’s difficulty stems from the similar-sounding data sources (NSS and NFHS), requiring precise recall.  Only statement 2 is correct, therefore (b) is the appropriate option.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is indeed the leading producer of bananas, mangoes, and papayas, it does *not* hold the top position in vegetable exports.  The statement incorrectly states India's ranking in vegetable exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MIDH framework explicitly includes the National Horticulture Board (NHB) as one of its key components. The statement erroneously omits a significant part of the MIDH structure.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Human Development Report (HDR):**

1. The HDR, released annually by the World Bank since 1990, examines major global challenges affecting human development.
2. The Human Development Index (HDI), a core component of the HDR, was developed by Amartya Sen and published since 1990.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The HDR is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank, since 1990.  The World Bank publishes different reports focusing on global economic development.  The UNDP's focus is broader, encompassing social and environmental factors alongside economic ones in its assessment of human development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the HDI is indeed a core component of the HDR and published since 1990, it was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul-Haq, not Amartya Sen.  Although Amartya Sen's work on capabilities and human development significantly influenced the conceptual framework of the HDI,  Mahbub ul-Haq is credited with its creation and initial development.  Confusing the two economists is a common error, highlighting the need for precise factual recall in this area.


**2. With reference to the Gender Inequality Index (GII), consider the following statements:**

1. The GII, measuring gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market, shows India consistently ranking among the top 20 globally.
2. The Gender Development Index (GDI), measuring gender disparities in HDI achievements, reveals high equality in HDI achievements between Indian men and women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's ranking on the GII is not consistently among the top 20.  The GII reflects significant gender inequalities in many developing countries, and India's performance, while improving, remains relatively low compared to many developed nations.  The statement attempts to mislead by suggesting a consistently high ranking, which is factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GDI for India does *not* reveal high equality in HDI achievements between men and women.  The text explicitly states that India shows low equality, with a significant absolute deviation from gender parity.  This statement reverses the actual finding to create a plausible but false alternative.


**3. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Global MPI report, published solely by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), found that India had the lowest number of people living in extreme poverty among the 112 countries surveyed.
2. The Indian National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, uses data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) to measure multidimensional poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. First, the 2024 Global MPI report was published jointly by the UNDP and OPHI, not solely by OPHI. Second, the report indicated that India had the *largest*, not the lowest, number of people living in extreme poverty among the countries surveyed. The statement manipulates both the collaborating organization and the key finding to create confusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS).  While both surveys provide valuable socio-economic data, they are distinct sources.  Substituting one for the other is a subtle but significant factual inaccuracy.


**4. With reference to the “Middle Income Trap,” consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank's 2024 World Development Report defines the “Middle Income Trap” as a situation where rapidly growing economies stagnate at middle-income levels and fail to transition to high-income status due primarily to insufficient investment in physical infrastructure.
2.  India, with a per capita GDP of approximately $5,000, is classified by the World Bank as a high-income country and therefore not at risk of falling into the middle-income trap.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while insufficient investment plays a role, the World Bank's definition of the "Middle Income Trap" is broader than just physical infrastructure limitations. It encompasses factors like a lack of technological innovation, institutional weaknesses, and inadequate human capital development. The statement oversimplifies the complex causes of the trap.

Statement 2 is incorrect on two points. First, India's per capita GDP is significantly lower than $5,000; the text states it's around $2,500.  Second, a per capita GDP of around $2,500 firmly places India within the category of middle-income countries, making it vulnerable to the middle-income trap.  The statement provides an inflated GDP figure and misrepresents India's income classification.


**5. With reference to the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  From independence to economic liberalization in India, GFCF consistently remained above 20% of GDP.
2. Net Capital Formation (NCF) excludes depreciation, obsolescence, and accidental damage to fixed capital.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that from independence to economic liberalization, investment (GFCF) remained slightly below or above 10% of GDP, not above 20%.  This is a significant numerical inaccuracy designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NCF *includes* an adjustment for depreciation, obsolescence, and accidental damage to fixed capital.  GCF represents the total investment, while NCF subtracts these factors to provide a more accurate measure of net additions to the capital stock. The statement reverses the relationship between GCF and NCF.


**6. With reference to the  Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI), consider the following statements:**

1. The PHDI adjusts the HDI to account for environmental sustainability, reflecting a concern for intergenerational equity.
2.  India's PHDI value is significantly higher than its HDI value, indicating a strong positive impact of environmental policies on human development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PHDI is designed to account for planetary pressures and their impact on future generations' well-being. It acknowledges the link between environmental sustainability and long-term human development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that India's PHDI value is *lower* than its HDI value, showing a negative impact of environmental pressures.  A 3% difference indicates that environmental sustainability is a significant constraint on India's human development progress.  The statement reverses the actual relationship between the HDI and PHDI values for India.


**7. With reference to the  Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement, administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO), mandates a minimum standard of protection for intellectual property rights for a period of 10 years.
2. The TRIPS Agreement explicitly prohibits compulsory licensing of patented products or processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the TRIPS agreement *does* set minimum standards of protection, it doesn't specify a uniform 10-year period. The duration of protection varies depending on the type of intellectual property (e.g., patents have longer protection periods than copyrights). The statement provides an incorrect timeframe.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement *allows* for compulsory licensing under certain conditions, particularly to address public health concerns or national emergencies. This flexibility is crucial for developing countries to access essential medicines or technologies. The statement incorrectly asserts a prohibition.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding  the Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index:**

1.  The World Bank's B-Ready Index, launched in 2024, replaced the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings and includes assessments for all 193 member countries of the United Nations.
2. The B-Ready Index focuses solely on bureaucratic regulatory hurdles, neglecting factors like infrastructure, human capital, and technological innovation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The B-Ready index, launched in 2024, did replace the EoDB rankings, but it does *not* include all 193 UN member countries in its initial phase.  The text specifies that it initially covers 50 economies. The statement inflates the number of countries covered.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The B-Ready index has a broader scope than just bureaucratic regulations.  While regulatory aspects are important, the index also considers aspects of the business and investment climate that go beyond simple bureaucratic hurdles. The statement misrepresents the scope of the index.



**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EIF is a bilateral partnership exclusively focused on poverty reduction in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) through trade promotion.
2. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) serves as the EIF Trust Fund Manager.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF is a *multilateral*, not bilateral, partnership.  While poverty reduction is a key objective, its focus is broader, encompassing sustainable development and using trade as an engine for growth in LDCs. The description of EIF as exclusively focused on poverty reduction through trade promotion is an oversimplification of its multifaceted approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the UNDP.  Confusing these two significant UN organizations is a common error, highlighting the need for precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  The UNOPS's role in managing the EIF's financial resources is crucial to its operational effectiveness.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related international organizations involved in development assistance.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN):**

1.  The DBN was established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN was established under the *Telecommunications Act, 2023*, not the much older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885. This highlights the importance of knowing the precise legislative framework underpinning recent policy initiatives. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of India's telecommunications regulatory landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The DBN did indeed replace the USOF, and the USOF's funding mechanism, a levy on licensees' adjusted gross revenue, is accurately described.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the financial mechanisms used to bridge the digital divide in India.  The subtle difference in the legislative basis of the DBN and the USOF makes this question challenging.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE will be established as a Section 25 Company under the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  The provisional name for the NCoE is the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE will be a Section *8*, not Section 25, company under the Companies Act, 2013.  This distinction is crucial in understanding the legal structure and operational characteristics of the NCoE. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall the precise legal framework governing the NCoE's establishment.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC) is indeed the provisional name given to the NCoE. This seemingly minor detail is a significant fact that tests the recall of specific information related to the AVGC-XR sector.  The question assesses the candidate's awareness of current developments in India's creative industries.


**4. With reference to the regulation of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) classifies all collateral-free loans to households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000 as microfinance loans.
2. The Malegam Committee's 2010 recommendations focused on a framework to regulate Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating as MFIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's definition of microfinance loans specifically limits the annual income threshold to *₹3,00,000 or less*.  Loans to households exceeding this income are not considered microfinance loans. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the precise criteria used in defining microfinance.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the precise parameters of microfinance loan eligibility.

Statement 2 is correct. The Malegam Committee's 2010 recommendations were indeed focused on creating a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs. This highlights the crucial role of regulatory bodies in shaping the microfinance sector. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the regulatory evolution of the microfinance sector in India. The seemingly small difference in the income threshold creates a significant challenge.


**5.  With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides loans with an interest subvention of 4% per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE for loans up to ₹2 crores.
2.  The AIF's recent expansion includes allowing convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for individual farmers only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The interest subvention offered under the AIF is 3%, not 4%, per annum.  This seemingly minor discrepancy is a common distractor in UPSC-style questions, testing the candidate's precision in recalling numerical data.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately remember key financial details of government schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM is a feature of the AIF's expansion, it is not limited to individual farmers.  It extends to groups of farmers, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and Panchayats.  This highlights the importance of understanding the scope and reach of government schemes.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the collaborative nature of rural development initiatives.


**6. With reference to the "Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies" report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report is an outcome of the WEF's AI for Agriculture Innovation (AI4AI) initiative, which focuses solely on promoting the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in formulating policies and guidelines related to PPPs at the national level. However, the implementation and execution of individual PPP projects are handled by various ministries and agencies depending on the sector.  It doesn't handle the implementation directly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee primarily evaluates central sector PPP projects. State-level PPP projects are typically appraised and monitored by respective state-level committees or agencies according to their own procedures and frameworks.  The central committee does not handle state projects.


**3. With reference to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMP exclusively focuses on monetizing government-owned land assets to generate revenue for infrastructure development.
2. The NMP targets ₹6.0 lakh crore in investment over a period of five years, starting from FY22.

This tool employs GIS technology, incorporating data from ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps to provide a comprehensive view of infrastructure projects.  The integration of various data sources is a key strength of the PMGS NMP, enabling better coordination and planning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While railway infrastructure is a crucial component of the PM GatiShakti initiative, it's not the sole focus. The approach is driven by seven engines, encompassing railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure.  This multi-modal approach aims to create a holistic and integrated infrastructure network, improving connectivity and efficiency across various sectors.  Focusing solely on railways misrepresents the scope and ambition of the PMGS.  The integrated nature of the plan is designed to address the bottlenecks across various transportation modes, highlighting the interconnectedness crucial for efficient logistics and economic growth.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by privatizing all existing government assets, thereby reducing the government's role in infrastructure development.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects, ensuring alignment with state-specific development priorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment, but it does so by *monetizing* (not privatizing) existing government assets.  This means leveraging existing assets to generate revenue through long-term leases or concessions, not outright sales.  The government retains ownership, but private entities contribute capital and expertise for operation and maintenance, thereby sharing the risk and reward.  Complete privatization would transfer ownership and control permanently to the private sector, which is not the goal of NMP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  While state governments have their own PPP frameworks and appraisal mechanisms, the central committee focuses specifically on projects under the purview of the central government.  State-level projects are evaluated through different processes managed by state-level authorities, reflecting the federal structure of India's governance. The distinction between central and state-level evaluation is crucial for understanding the hierarchical nature of infrastructure development and investment in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India Stack is a foundational DPI and includes a payment layer, it primarily relies on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), not the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS). UPI is a real-time mobile-based payment network, offering a more user-friendly and widely adopted system than IMPS.  The distinction between UPI and IMPS is crucial for understanding the evolution of digital payment systems in India.  UPI's success lies in its ease of use and broad accessibility, making it a cornerstone of India's digital economy.

Statement 1 is incorrect. UPI was launched in 2016, not 2008, and it's operated by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not directly by the RBI.  Both the launch year and the operating entity are incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions NIPL's partnership with Trinidad and Tobago to expand UPI internationally.  The statement correctly reflects the ongoing efforts to globalize the UPI system.


**1. With reference to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), primarily focusing on brownfield infrastructure assets across 13 sectors.
2.  The top five sectors under the NMP—Roads, Railways, Power, Oil & Gas pipelines, and Telecom—account for approximately 83% of the total monetisation target.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP). Statement 1 correctly identifies the NMP's goal of generating investment through the monetisation of existing government assets, specifying the target amount and timeframe.  The focus on brownfield infrastructure assets and the involvement of 13 sectors are also accurate.  Statement 2 is also correct, highlighting the disproportionate contribution of the top five sectors (Roads, Railways, Power, Oil & Gas pipelines, and Telecom) to the overall NMP target.  These sectors represent a significant portion of India's existing infrastructure and offer substantial potential for monetisation. Therefore, the correct answer is (c) Both 1 and 2.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in either statement.


**2. With reference to Asset Monetization (AM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijay Kelkar Committee first recommended asset monetization in 2012, which was subsequently announced in the Union Budget 2021-22 through the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP).
2. AM involves the outright sale of government-owned assets to private sector entities, aiming for maximum revenue generation through immediate transfer of ownership.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the genesis of asset monetization in India. The Vijay Kelkar Committee's recommendation in 2012 and its formal inclusion in the Union Budget 2021-22 via the NMP are well-documented facts.  Statement 2, however, presents an inaccurate portrayal of the AM process. While revenue generation is a key objective, AM does *not* solely involve outright sales.  Instead, it primarily employs licensing and leasing agreements, transferring rights to private entities for specified periods in exchange for payments.  This approach allows for balanced risk-sharing between the public and private sectors and avoids immediate and complete relinquishment of asset ownership.  The nuanced approach to risk-sharing inherent in lease and license agreements is a crucial component of AM policy that Statement 2 overlooks, making it incorrect. Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF), consider the following statements:**

1. The VGF provides up to 30% of project costs as a capital grant to enhance project viability, primarily focusing on infrastructure projects in the public sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF). Statement 1 incorrectly states that the VGF provides up to 30% of project costs. In reality, the VGF can provide up to 40% of project costs as a capital grant.  Moreover, while the VGF is predominantly used for infrastructure projects, it's not exclusively limited to the public sector; it can also support Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The funding for VGF projects can involve both central and state governments, as well as other co-financing sources.  It's not solely funded by the central government.  The combination of inaccuracies in both statements makes the correct option (d) Neither 1 nor 2.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines Green Shoots as early indicators of economic recovery following a downturn.  This is a widely accepted economic concept.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. While the RBI does analyze various sectors to gauge economic health, the provided text specifically mentions the RBI identifying the rural economy's performance as a Green Shoot indicator within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, not the IT sector.  The substitution of the IT sector for the FMCG sector in Statement 2 makes it factually incorrect.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer. The specific sector mentioned by the RBI is a crucial detail that differentiates the correct answer from the incorrect one.


**6. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP), consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is the minimum rate at which farmers sell their crops to the government, aiming to prevent distress selling and ensuring a minimum level of income for farmers.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, and the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the purpose and function of the Minimum Support Price (MSP). It accurately states that the MSP aims to protect farmers from distress sales by providing a guaranteed minimum price for their produce.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) does recommend MSPs, the final decision-making authority rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.  The CCEA's role is a critical detail that distinguishes the correct statement from the incorrect one.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct, and the answer is (a).


**7. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. NBFCs can accept demand deposits like commercial banks, offering a wider range of financial services to customers.
2.  NBFCs are subject to Scale-based Regulation (SBR) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), categorizing them into different tiers based on their size and risk profiles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key distinction between NBFCs and banks is that NBFCs *cannot* accept demand deposits. This is a fundamental difference in their operational structure and regulatory framework.  Statement 2 is correct. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does indeed implement Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs, categorizing them into tiers based on their size and risk profiles to tailor regulatory requirements appropriately.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.  The ability to accept demand deposits is a crucial differentiating factor between NBFCs and banks, making Statement 1 incorrect.


**12. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1. A Non-Performing Asset (NPA) is a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 180 days, indicating a significant risk of default.
2. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) plays a key role in monitoring and managing NPAs within the Indian financial system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition of an NPA is a loan or advance overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days.  This crucial timeframe distinction makes the statement factually incorrect. Statement 2 is correct. The Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) plays a significant role in overseeing the stability of the Indian financial system, which includes monitoring and addressing issues related to NPAs.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. The precise definition of an NPA, including the crucial 90-day timeframe, is a key element that distinguishes the correct from the incorrect statement.

2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP, with the final decision resting with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP is announced *at the beginning* of the sowing season, not at the end. This timing is crucial to provide farmers with price certainty before they make decisions regarding planting and investment in their crops.  Announcing it after the harvest would defeat the purpose of ensuring a minimum price to protect farmers from distress selling.  The early announcement allows farmers to plan their production with confidence, knowing they will receive at least the MSP for their produce.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CACP is indeed the body responsible for recommending MSPs based on a detailed analysis of production costs and market conditions. The final decision on the MSP, however, rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister.  This process reflects the political and economic importance of MSPs in agricultural policy and the need for broader governmental oversight.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a major producer of millets, accounting for a significant portion of Asian production (nearly 80%), it does not account for over 80% of *global* production. The text specifies that India accounts for 20% of global millet production, indicating a substantial but not dominant global share.  The statement overestimates India's global share, potentially due to a misunderstanding of the regional versus global context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text identifies the stagnation in millet production as being caused by factors such as a yield gap due to labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer use, a shift in consumer preferences, and storage issues due to the relatively shorter shelf life of millets.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual factors contributing to stagnant production.  The challenges faced by millet farmers are multi-faceted and require a comprehensive approach to address.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LPI is released *every two years*, not annually, by the World Bank Group. This bi-annual release allows for a more comprehensive assessment of logistics performance, considering the cyclical nature of economic activities and the time required for data collection and analysis. The statement incorrectly states the frequency of the LPI release, potentially leading to confusion regarding the timeliness of data.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India's ranking improved in 2023, moving up six places from 44th to 38th, it did *not* place it among the top 25 countries. The statement overstates India's improved ranking, potentially creating a misleading impression of the country's progress in logistics performance.  The improvement is notable but doesn't represent a significant leap to the top 25.  The actual ranking still indicates room for substantial improvement in India's logistics infrastructure and efficiency.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ICI includes *eight*, not ten, core industries. These eight industries contribute 40.27% to the IIP, not over 50%.  The statement incorrectly inflates both the number of industries and their contribution to the IIP, potentially misleading assessments of the ICI's scope and importance.  The accurate figures are crucial for understanding the weight and influence of the ICI within the broader industrial production index.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that petroleum refinery products have the *highest* weight (28.04%) in the ICI, followed by electricity (19.85%). The statement reverses the order of weight, creating a significant factual error.  The correct weighting of the core industries is essential for interpreting the ICI data and understanding the relative contributions of different sectors to overall industrial production.  The reversed order misrepresents the relative importance of these key industries.

Furthermore, while improving cattle productivity is an objective, the scheme's scope is broader than just cattle, encompassing a wider range of livestock health and production improvements.  The statement underestimates the scheme's financial commitment and inaccurately limits its focus to cattle productivity. The correct figures and broader scope are essential for understanding the scheme's overall impact.


**1. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  NBFCs are permitted to accept demand deposits from the public, similar to commercial banks, but are subject to stricter capital adequacy requirements.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) solely regulates all aspects of NBFC operations, including their lending practices and investment strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NBFCs are explicitly prohibited from accepting demand deposits. This is a fundamental difference between NBFCs and banks.  Banks are allowed to accept demand deposits (like checking accounts), while NBFCs are limited to term deposits and other non-demand liabilities. The capital adequacy requirements for NBFCs are indeed stricter than those for some smaller banks, but that doesn't change the fact that they cannot accept demand deposits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating NBFCs, it doesn't have exclusive jurisdiction over all aspects of their operations.  Other regulatory bodies also oversee different facets of NBFC activities. For example, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates Nidhi Companies, a specific type of NBFC.  The National Housing Bank regulates Housing Finance Companies, and SEBI regulates NBFCs involved in certain investment activities.  The RBI's regulatory role is substantial, but it's not the sole regulator for all NBFCs.


**2. With reference to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), consider the following statements:**

1.  DICGC insures all types of deposits held by customers in all scheduled commercial banks, up to a maximum amount of ₹5 lakh per depositor, per bank.
2.  DICGC coverage extends to deposits held in NBFCs, ensuring depositors' funds are protected in case of bank failure or NBFC insolvency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DICGC, established under the DICGC Act, 1961, provides deposit insurance coverage to depositors in commercial banks, local area banks, and regional rural banks. This coverage extends to various deposit types up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh per depositor and per bank.  The insurance protects depositors against losses arising from bank failures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. DICGC's insurance coverage is specifically limited to deposits in banks and does *not* extend to NBFCs.  This is a key distinction highlighting the different risk profiles and regulatory frameworks governing banks and NBFCs.  Depositors in NBFCs do not have the same level of protection as those in banks.


**3. With reference to Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SBR framework categorizes NBFCs into four tiers based solely on their asset size, with larger NBFCs facing stricter regulatory scrutiny.
2.  Under the SBR, all four tiers of NBFCs are subject to identical regulatory requirements, promoting uniform standards across the sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While asset size is a crucial factor, the SBR framework for NBFCs considers more than just asset size when categorizing NBFCs into four tiers.  The classification also takes into account the nature of the NBFC's activities and the perceived level of risk associated with its operations.  A larger NBFC with less risky activities might not face the same level of scrutiny as a smaller NBFC engaged in higher-risk activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The core principle of SBR is *differential* regulation.  Each tier of NBFCs faces different regulatory requirements tailored to its size and risk profile.  The regulatory intensity increases with the tier and perceived risk, ensuring proportionate regulation based on the potential systemic impact of each NBFC.


**4. With reference to Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending regulations for NBFCs in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  NBFC-P2P lending platforms are permitted to directly lend funds to borrowers without any intermediary role, fostering direct lending relationships.
2.  Regulations prohibit P2P platforms from marketing P2P lending as an investment product and restrict the amount a single lender can lend across all P2P platforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NBFC-P2P lending platforms act as intermediaries, facilitating the connection between individual lenders and borrowers. They do not directly lend their own funds; instead, they provide the platform for the transaction.  The platform manages the process but doesn't assume the credit risk itself.

Statement 2 is correct. Regulations clearly stipulate that P2P platforms cannot promote their services as investment products, preventing misleading marketing that could attract uninformed investors.  Furthermore, to mitigate risk and prevent overexposure, there are limits on the amount an individual lender can invest across all P2P platforms.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Non-Performing Assets (NPAs):**

1.  An NPA is defined as a loan or advance where the principal or interest payment is overdue for more than 90 days.
2.  The Financial Stability Report (FSR), published biannually by the RBI, focuses exclusively on the NPA levels of public sector banks and excludes private sector banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition of an NPA generally involves overdue payments (principal or interest) for a period exceeding 90 days. This is a standard benchmark used to classify loans as non-performing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI's FSR provides a comprehensive assessment of the financial stability of the Indian banking system.  It includes an analysis of NPAs across all scheduled commercial banks, encompassing both public and private sector banks, along with other relevant financial institutions.  The report doesn't limit its scope to only public sector banks.


**6. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, irrespective of their size or financial health, to ensure uniform regulatory oversight.
2.  Key parameters for monitoring under the PCA framework include capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability of the UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PCA framework for UCBs doesn't apply universally to all UCBs.  It specifically targets UCBs categorized as tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4, excluding those already under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  The framework is designed to address the financial health of weaker banks, not to impose uniform oversight on all.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PCA framework focuses on critical aspects of a UCB's financial health: capital adequacy (to ensure sufficient buffers against losses), asset quality (to assess the proportion of non-performing assets), and profitability (to gauge the bank's ability to generate earnings).  These parameters are central to evaluating the bank's overall financial soundness.


**7. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I NBFC-ND, meaning it does not accept public funds or interact directly with customers.
2.  One of NUCFDC’s key functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs, including raising capital and offering fund management services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND. This classification signifies that it *does* accept public funds and interacts directly with customers (UCBs in this case).  Type I NBFC-NDs are those that do not have a customer interface.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary function of NUCFDC is to support UCBs financially by raising capital (with a target of ₹300 crore) and providing fund management and consultancy services. This is crucial for strengthening the overall financial health and stability of the UCB sector.


**8. With reference to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Malegam Committee recommended a framework for regulating NBFC-MFIs in 2015, leading to stricter regulations on microfinance lending.
2.  All collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households (annual income up to ₹3,00,000) are considered microfinance loans as per RBI guidelines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's Malegam Committee submitted its report and recommendations on regulating NBFC-MFIs in 2010, not 2015.  These recommendations were instrumental in shaping the regulatory framework for MFIs in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RBI defines microfinance loans based on the criteria of collateral-free lending to low-income households with an annual income up to ₹3,00,000. This definition is crucial for identifying and regulating microfinance activities within the broader financial landscape.


**9. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMY provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises exclusively through commercial banks.
2. The 2024 Union Budget increased the loan limit under the Tarun Plus category to ₹20 lakh from the previous limit of ₹10 lakh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMY provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, the disbursement isn't limited to commercial banks.  NBFCs and other eligible financial institutions are also involved in providing loans under this scheme.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 Union Budget did indeed enhance the loan limit for the Tarun Plus category of PMMY to ₹20 lakh, building on the earlier ₹10 lakh limit under the Tarun category.  This increase reflects an effort to provide greater financial support to eligible enterprises.


**10. With reference to Nidhi Companies, consider the following statements:**

1. A Nidhi Company is a type of NBFC that accepts deposits from and lends to its members only, for their mutual benefit.
2.  The minimum number of members required for a Nidhi Company to be registered is one hundred, and the net owned funds must be at least five lakh rupees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nidhi Companies are a specific type of NBFC that operate on a mutual benefit basis, restricting their deposit-taking and lending activities to their members. This closed-group structure distinguishes them from other NBFCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The minimum number of members required to form a Nidhi Company is two hundred, not one hundred.  The requirement for net owned funds is also higher—ten lakh rupees, not five lakh rupees.  These stricter requirements aim to ensure the financial stability and solvency of Nidhi Companies.


**11. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is a voluntary certification scheme, allowing manufacturers to choose whether or not to obtain the mark for their products.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and administering the ISI mark scheme, ensuring product quality and safety.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While not all products require the ISI mark, it is mandatory for certain products specified by the Central Government through Quality Control Orders (QCOs). The decision to obtain the mark is not entirely voluntary for these products.

Statement 2 is correct. The BIS, established under the BIS Act, 2016, is the National Standard Body of India.  It's responsible for developing and managing the ISI mark scheme, ensuring that products bearing the mark meet specified quality and safety standards.  This contributes to consumer protection and standardization in the market.


**12. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, with a target of ₹6 lakh crore over five years (FY22 to FY26).
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state-level PPP projects to ensure their financial viability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is mostly correct.  The NMP aims to generate investment through the monetisation of government assets, targeting ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not five years.  The timeframe is a key detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee primarily evaluates central sector PPP projects. State-level PPP projects typically have their own appraisal mechanisms at the state level.  The committee's mandate is focused on the central government's projects.


**13. With reference to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, ensuring adherence to banking norms and practices.
2.  One of the most important functions of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) is to provide funds to PACS, which are crucial for providing credit to farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are *not* regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  They operate under a different regulatory framework specific to the cooperative sector.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs play a vital role in providing financial support to PACS, which in turn are critical for extending credit and other agricultural input services to farmers at the grassroots level.  This interlinkage is essential for the functioning of the rural credit system.


**14. With reference to the initiatives for modernizing Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. The government's centrally sponsored project aims to computerize all functional PACS across the country by 2025.
2. The National Cooperative Database (NCD) provides comprehensive information about the cooperative sector, including PACS, enabling better monitoring and management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the government aims to computerize a significant number of PACS, the target isn't *all* functional PACS by 2025. The initial phase focuses on computerizing 18,000 PACS, with a broader plan to eventually cover 63,000 functional PACS.  The timeframe is not specified, neither is it 2025.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCD serves as a centralized repository of information for the cooperative sector, offering valuable data on PACS and other cooperative entities.  This facilitates better monitoring, planning, and overall management of the cooperative sector.


**15. With reference to Wilful Defaulters (WDs) as per RBI guidelines, consider the following statements:**

1. A wilful defaulter is defined as a borrower who has defaulted on loan repayments with an outstanding amount exceeding ₹25 lakh.
2. The RBI's directions on the treatment of WDs apply only to commercial banks and exclude other financial institutions like NBFCs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI defines a wilful defaulter based on several criteria including the intention to default,  the amount of outstanding dues (exceeding ₹25 lakh), and the duration of default.  The ₹25 lakh threshold is a significant element in the definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RBI's directions on the treatment of WDs are applicable to a broader range of institutions, not just commercial banks.  These directions impact various regulated entities, including NBFCs and other financial institutions, to ensure consistency in dealing with wilful defaults across the financial sector.


**16. With reference to Co-lending arrangements between banks and NBFCs in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Banks are allowed to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group, provided the total exposure remains within regulatory limits.
2. Under co-lending, banks and NBFCs can jointly provide loans to priority sectors, with a minimum of 20% credit risk borne by the NBFC and the remaining by the bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Banks are explicitly *prohibited* from entering into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain the integrity of the co-lending framework.

Statement 2 is correct. Co-lending allows banks and NBFCs to jointly provide loans to priority sectors, sharing the credit risk.  The RBI mandates a minimum of 20% risk sharing by the NBFC, with the bank bearing the remaining portion.  This risk-sharing arrangement enhances lending capacity while mitigating risk for individual institutions.


**17. With reference to the RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks, consider the following statements:**

1. The new norms apply only to Urban Cooperative Banks and exclude State and Central Cooperative Banks.
2.  Cooperative banks must charge provisions for Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) as an expense in their Profit and Loss Account before allocating net profits to BDDR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The revised NPA provision norms for cooperative banks apply to all types of cooperative banks—Urban, State, and Central Cooperative Banks.  The aim is to ensure consistent standards across the cooperative banking sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  The new norms mandate that cooperative banks must account for provisions for BDDR as an expense in their Profit and Loss Account before making any allocations to BDDR from net profits.  This approach ensures that the banks accurately reflect the potential losses associated with NPAs in their financial statements.


**1. With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture under the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1.  Tariffication, a key component of Market Access under the Agreement, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, thereby eliminating quotas and variable levies.
2.  The "Peace Clause," adopted at the 9th Ministerial Conference, provides a permanent solution to concerns regarding public stockholding (PSH) for food security, addressing the concerns of developing nations about export restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Agreement on Agriculture, negotiated during the Uruguay Round and ratified in Marrakesh in 1994, includes Market Access as a crucial pillar.  A core element of Market Access is tariffication, which requires the conversion of all non-tariff barriers (like quotas and variable levies) into equivalent tariffs. This aims to create a more transparent and predictable trading system for agricultural products.  The elimination of non-tariff barriers is a central objective of the agreement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Peace Clause," agreed upon at the 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali, is *not* a permanent solution to the public stockholding (PSH) issue. It was adopted as an interim measure to provide temporary protection to developing countries' PSH programs while negotiations for a permanent solution continued.  India, along with other developing countries, continues to seek a permanent solution that allows for greater flexibility in their domestic food security programs without facing punitive trade actions.  The  "Peace Clause" offered a temporary reprieve, not a permanent resolution to the concerns raised by developing nations about export restrictions linked to PSH policies.


**2. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1.  The agreement, adopted during the 12th Ministerial Conference in Geneva in 2022, aims to eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies to ensure sustainable fishing practices globally and prevent overfishing.
2.  The Geneva Package's primary objective is to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to the depletion of fish stocks, but it allows for certain subsidies deemed beneficial for sustainable fishing practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package) does not aim to eliminate *all* forms of fisheries subsidies.  Its focus is on curbing *harmful* subsidies that contribute to overfishing and the depletion of fish stocks.  The agreement recognizes that some subsidies can play a positive role in promoting sustainable fishing practices.  The nuanced approach reflects the complexity of the issue and the need to balance environmental concerns with the economic needs of fishing communities.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of the Geneva Package is to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and the unsustainable exploitation of fish stocks.  However, it makes allowances for certain subsidies that are deemed beneficial for sustainable fishing practices. This reflects a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the need to support responsible fishing while addressing the environmental damage caused by harmful subsidies.  The agreement represents a significant step towards improving the sustainability of global fisheries, but it is not a complete ban on all forms of subsidies.


**3. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates all PPP projects, both at the central and state levels, ensuring adherence to financial regulations and transparency.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to attract private investment by monetising existing government assets, thereby reducing the government's fiscal burden and improving infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a crucial role in evaluating central sector PPP projects, it does *not* assess all PPP projects at both the central and state levels.  State governments have their own mechanisms for evaluating and approving PPP projects within their jurisdictions.  The statement overstates the committee's reach and purview.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative aimed at attracting private investment into infrastructure development by monetising existing government assets. This involves leasing or selling government-owned assets to private entities, generating revenue for the government and leveraging private sector expertise and capital for infrastructure upgrades and expansion. The NMP is a key strategy to address India's infrastructure financing needs.


**4. With reference to the inverted duty structure (IDS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS arises when the GST rate on inputs is lower than the GST rate on finished goods, leading to a situation where businesses cannot claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) fully, thus impacting their competitiveness.
2.  The impact of IDS includes increased production costs for domestic industries, making it difficult to compete in both the domestic and export markets, leading to working capital issues due to blocked ITC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An inverted duty structure (IDS) occurs when the import duties or GST rates on input goods are *higher* than on finished goods. This creates a situation where businesses pay more tax on inputs than they receive as credit on sales, leading to a blockage of Input Tax Credit (ITC).  The statement incorrectly reverses the relationship between input and output tax rates.

Statement 2 is correct.  The impact of IDS on domestic industries is significant. Higher input costs make products more expensive, reducing competitiveness in both domestic and export markets.  The inability to fully utilize ITC results in blocked working capital, creating financial challenges for businesses.  This situation highlights the need for policy interventions to address IDS and ensure a level playing field for domestic industries.


**5. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recent amendment to the Finance Bill abolished indexation benefits for immovable properties acquired after a specified cut-off date, but grandfathered properties acquired before that date are exempt from this change.
2. The abolishment of indexation benefits for long-term capital gains on immovable property applies retroactively to all properties regardless of the date of acquisition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Recent amendments to the Finance Bill have indeed abolished indexation benefits for long-term capital gains (LTCG) on immovable properties acquired *after* a specific cut-off date. However, a grandfather clause was included to protect those who acquired properties *before* the cut-off date; they retain the benefit of indexation. This demonstrates a balanced approach to policy changes, mitigating the immediate impact on existing property owners while implementing the new tax regime for future acquisitions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The abolishment of indexation benefits is *not* retroactive.  It applies only to properties acquired *after* the specified cut-off date.  The grandfather clause explicitly protects those who acquired their properties before that date. The statement misrepresents the scope and application of the amendment, failing to account for the key grandfathering provision.


**6. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is mandated to provide short-term loans to infrastructure projects, playing a crucial role in facilitating quick project completion and reducing project delays.
2. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI), ensuring its financial stability and adherence to regulatory norms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID's focus is on providing *long-term*, non-recourse financing for infrastructure projects.  Short-term loans are not its primary mandate. Its role is to support the long-term development of infrastructure financing, not to address immediate, short-term funding needs.  The statement mischaracterizes the institution's core function and timeframe for financing.

Statement 2 is correct. NaBFID is indeed regulated and supervised by the RBI as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI) under the RBI Act, 1934.  This regulatory oversight ensures its financial stability, adherence to sound banking practices, and compliance with relevant regulations. The RBI's supervision is vital for maintaining the credibility and effectiveness of NaBFID in its crucial role of long-term infrastructure financing.


**7. With reference to the  Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) issues the ISI mark, making it mandatory for all products sold in India to ensure consistent quality and safety standards across all sectors.
2.  The central government, through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), mandates the ISI mark for specific products, ensuring that these products meet defined quality and safety standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark, issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), is *not* mandatory for *all* products sold in India. The central government, through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), makes the ISI mark mandatory for *specific* products to ensure quality and safety standards.  The statement overstates the scope of the ISI mark's application.

Statement 2 is correct. The central government uses QCOs to mandate the ISI mark for certain products, ensuring they meet specified quality and safety standards.  This selective approach focuses on products where quality and safety are paramount, such as electrical appliances, medical equipment, and building materials.  The statement accurately reflects the government's role in regulating product quality through the ISI marking scheme.


**8. With reference to the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 1971, the JCI primarily focuses on procuring jute at minimum support prices (MSP) and exporting it to international markets to increase the income of jute farmers.
2. The JCI implements the Jute I-CARE project, aimed at mechanising jute farming and improving retting techniques, thereby boosting productivity and quality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the JCI does procure jute at MSP, its primary focus is not on exporting it internationally.  Its main role is to provide price support to jute farmers and stabilize the domestic market.  Exporting jute is a secondary function, not its main objective.  The statement misrepresents the JCI's core functions and priorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The JCI indeed implements the Jute I-CARE project, which aims to enhance jute farming through mechanization and improved retting techniques.  This project directly addresses the need for increased productivity and better quality jute, benefiting jute farmers and the industry as a whole.  The statement accurately reflects a key initiative of the JCI.


**9. With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, is a biennial survey that assesses the financial inclusion of rural households, focusing primarily on access to credit and insurance products.
2.  The NAFINDEX, derived from NAFIS data, measures financial inclusion in rural areas, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of government policies and programs aimed at improving financial access.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NAFIS is not a biennial survey; its frequency is not explicitly defined as such in available information. While the focus is on financial inclusion, it covers a broader range of aspects beyond just credit and insurance, encompassing livelihoods, access to various financial services, and overall financial well-being of rural households.  The statement is too restrictive in its description of the survey's scope and frequency.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NAFINDEX is indeed derived from NAFIS data and serves as a key indicator of financial inclusion in rural India.  It provides valuable insights into the progress made in expanding access to financial services and the effectiveness of government policies and initiatives aimed at improving financial inclusion.  The statement accurately reflects the role and significance of NAFINDEX in assessing rural financial inclusion.


**10. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS, registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and play a crucial role in providing short-term credit to farmers.
2.  PACS function as the grassroots level arm of the short-term cooperative credit structure, providing credit and other financial services directly to farmers, but their regulation and supervision are primarily under the purview of the respective State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are *not* registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are *not* directly regulated by the RBI.  They are registered under the respective State Cooperative Societies Acts and are primarily overseen by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  The statement wrongly attributes regulatory authority to the RBI.

Statement 2 is correct. PACS are indeed the grassroots level institutions of the short-term cooperative credit structure. They provide crucial credit and other financial services to farmers at the village level.  Their regulation and supervision are primarily the responsibility of the respective State Registrar of Cooperative Societies, reflecting the decentralized nature of cooperative governance in India.  The statement correctly identifies the role and regulatory framework of PACS.



**1. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. PMGS NMP utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, employing a GIS platform and integrating ISRO satellite imagery.
2.  The PM GatiShakti approach is solely driven by technological advancements in logistics and transportation, disregarding other infrastructural aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan leverages a Digital Master Planning tool created by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG-N).  This tool uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform and integrates data from ISRO satellite imagery for comprehensive planning and execution of infrastructure projects. This integration allows for efficient resource allocation and project monitoring.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PM GatiShakti heavily emphasizes technological advancements in logistics and transportation,  it's not solely driven by these factors.  The approach is driven by seven engines: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure. This multi-modal approach aims for integrated development of various infrastructure sectors, demonstrating a holistic view beyond just technology.  Ignoring other crucial infrastructural components would be a significant oversight in a national master plan aiming for comprehensive connectivity and development.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by privatizing all government-owned assets, thereby completely relinquishing government control.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects, excluding central sector projects from its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by *monetizing* existing government assets, not by *privatizing* them entirely. Monetization involves generating revenue from existing assets through various models, including long-term leases or concessions, without necessarily transferring ownership.  The government retains some level of control and benefits from the revenue generated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects.  While state governments have their own mechanisms for evaluating PPP projects, the central committee focuses on projects under the purview of the central government.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), primarily focusing on internal lending and investment within the cooperative sector.
2.  One of NUCFDC's major functions is to develop a shared technology platform to help Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) expand their services at lower costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds and have a customer interface, unlike Type I which does not.  NUCFDC's role involves interacting with and providing services to UCBs, requiring it to handle public funds.

Statement 2 is correct.  Developing a shared technology platform to reduce costs for UCBs in expanding services is a key function of NUCFDC. This aims to improve the efficiency and reach of UCBs, promoting financial inclusion and strengthening the urban cooperative banking sector.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will come into effect from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs irrespective of their tier classification (tier 1, tier 2, tier 3, or tier 4), including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework for UCBs is to come into effect from April 1, 2025, not 2024.  The timeline for implementation is a crucial detail in understanding regulatory changes within the banking sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  UCBs under AID are already subject to stringent regulatory measures, and thus the PCA framework does not apply to them.  The exclusion highlights a nuanced approach to regulatory intervention based on the specific circumstances of individual banks.


**5. With reference to the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The JCI was established in 1972 primarily to ensure quality control and standardization of jute products for export markets.
2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the exclusive use of jute packaging for all commodities, irrespective of their nature or origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The JCI was established in 1971, not 1972, as a price support agency for jute farmers, not primarily for quality control and standardization for exports, although that is a secondary function. The primary aim was to stabilize jute prices and support the livelihoods of jute farmers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the compulsory use of jute packaging for *certain* commodities, not all.  The act targets specific commodities where jute packaging is deemed suitable and environmentally beneficial, not a blanket mandate for all goods.


**6.  With reference to the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFIS was launched in 2018-19, aiming to assess the financial inclusion levels of the rural population in India.
2.  NAFINDEX, a measure of financial inclusion, is solely based on data collected from the first NAFIS survey conducted in 2016-17.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS was launched in 2016-17, not 2018-19.  The launch year is a key fact in understanding the timeline of rural financial inclusion initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NAFINDEX uses data from *both* the first and second NAFIS surveys.  The index relies on data collected over multiple surveys to provide a comprehensive and evolving picture of financial inclusion in rural areas. Relying only on the first survey would provide an incomplete and outdated assessment.


**7. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are registered under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS, supporting their operations and financial stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  They are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) and are *not* directly regulated by the RBI. This difference in regulatory oversight is a crucial distinction between PACS and other financial institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs are a vital source of funds for PACS.  Their role in providing financial support is essential for the functioning and stability of PACS at the grassroots level.  This inter-linkage within the cooperative credit structure is important for understanding rural credit systems.


**8. With reference to the ISI mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and is mandatory for all products sold in India, irrespective of their nature or category.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) was established under the BIS Act, 2015, with the primary aim of promoting international trade by ensuring high quality standards for Indian exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not mandatory for *all* products sold in India.  It's mandatory for only *certain* products specified by the Central Government through Quality Control Orders (QCOs).  The selective application of the ISI mark reflects a targeted approach to quality control, focusing on products deemed critical for safety and consumer protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BIS was established under the BIS Act, 2016, not 2015.  The primary aim is not solely to promote international trade but to harmoniously develop standardization, marking, and quality certification of goods within India, contributing to both domestic and international trade.


**9. With reference to Green Shoots in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, consider the following statements:**

1. Green Shoots indicate a decline in economic activity and a contraction in a particular sector.
2.  The FMCG sector encompasses only luxury goods and high-value consumer durables, excluding essential daily-use products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Green Shoots represent positive signs of economic growth or recovery *after* an economic downturn.  They indicate the beginning of a revival, not a decline in economic activity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FMCG sector includes high-turnover *consumer packaged goods* that are consumed within a short span of time.  These are primarily *essential* daily-use products like toiletries, detergents, and food items, not exclusively luxury goods or high-value durables.  The definition is crucial for understanding the nature and scope of this vital sector.


**10. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Ombudsman scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI Ombudsman scheme is applicable to all financial institutions operating in India, including private banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and credit unions.
2.  The RBI may appoint its officers as Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman for a tenure exceeding five years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Ombudsman scheme's applicability is limited to specific entities. It covers complaints against certain categories of regulated entities, not all financial institutions.  The specific categories include  banks, NBFCs (excluding housing finance companies above a certain asset size), payment system participants, and credit information companies.  The limited scope reflects a targeted approach to consumer redressal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI may appoint its officers as Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman for a tenure *not exceeding* three years at a time.  The limited tenure ensures regular review and prevents potential biases or conflicts of interest.


**11. With reference to Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) as recognized by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1. An SRO must be set up as a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure its financial sustainability and independence.
2.  An SRO's governance framework requires at least one-third of its Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, to be independent members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An SRO must be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. The not-for-profit structure aligns with the SRO's objective of promoting compliance and ethical conduct within its sector, rather than maximizing profit.

Statement 2 is correct.  The requirement for independent directors ensures objective decision-making and mitigates potential conflicts of interest within the SRO's governance structure. The independent members bring an external perspective, enhancing the credibility and effectiveness of the SRO.


**12. With reference to derivatives regulation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Trading in derivatives is solely regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), without any involvement of other regulatory bodies.
2. The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA), 1956, was recently amended to restrict direct listing of securities by Indian companies on international exchanges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While SEBI plays a major role, trading in derivatives is regulated under both the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA), 1956, and the SEBI Act, 1992.  This dual regulatory framework ensures comprehensive oversight of the derivatives market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The recent amendment to the SCRA, 1956, actually aims to *facilitate*, not restrict, direct listing of securities by Indian companies on international exchanges located in International Financial Service Centres (IFSCs).  This reflects a policy shift towards greater integration of Indian capital markets with global financial systems.


**13. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) and Credit Bureaus are essentially the same entities, performing identical functions in assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers.
2.  All seven CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CRAs and Credit Bureaus have distinct functions. CRAs provide forward-looking opinions on the creditworthiness of borrowers, assessing their future ability to meet financial commitments.  Credit Bureaus, on the other hand, provide information on past debt repayment behavior.  The difference in focus is crucial for understanding their respective roles in credit risk assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While six of the seven CRAs registered with SEBI are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions, Brickwork Ratings is not.  This distinction highlights the nuances of regulatory oversight in the financial sector, with different agencies focusing on different aspects of CRA operations.


**14. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), consider the following statements:**

1. InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds, allowing investors to participate in infrastructure projects with high entry barriers and limited liquidity.
2.  The sponsors of InvITs are not recognized as borrowers under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs allow for investment in infrastructure projects with *low* ticket sizes, making them accessible to a wider range of investors.  They are also *liquid*, being listed on stock exchanges, allowing investors to exit their positions relatively easily.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The sponsors of InvITs *are* recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.  This recognition is important for the legal framework governing the recovery of dues in case of defaults.  The inclusion under SARFAESI Act is a key element of the risk management framework for InvITs.


**15. With reference to Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and its global advancement, consider the following statements:**

1. The One Future Alliance, proposed by the G20 India Presidency, aims to hinder the implementation of DPI in Low and Middle-Income Countries.
2. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was launched to establish a focused institution working on DPI and includes a Social Impact Fund (SIF) for accelerating its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

1. UPI was launched in 2017 and is an instant real-time payment system developed by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA).
2.  The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) is an umbrella organization for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India, incorporated by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) in 2009.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UPI was launched in 2016, not 2017.  The launch year is a significant detail in tracking the evolution of digital payment systems in India.  Also, UPI was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not the IBA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NPCI was incorporated in 2008, not 2009, by the RBI and IBA, under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  The year of incorporation is a key fact in understanding the timeline of NPCI's establishment and its role in the Indian payments landscape.


**17. With reference to Windfall Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. A windfall tax is a tax imposed on industries experiencing below-average profits to discourage inefficient practices and encourage better resource management.
2.  Governments typically justify windfall taxes by arguing that the excessive profits are solely due to the taxed entity's efforts and business acumen.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A windfall tax is imposed on industries experiencing *significantly above-average* profits, not below-average profits.  The tax targets industries benefiting from unusually favorable economic conditions, not those struggling financially.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Governments justify windfall taxes by arguing that the excessive profits are due to *external factors* beyond the control of the taxed entity, such as unexpected market booms or favorable government policies.  The justification emphasizes the redistribution of unearned gains for broader societal benefit, not solely rewarding superior business performance.


**1. With reference to India's logistics infrastructure, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases, significantly impacting freight transportation.
2. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), managed by DFCCIL, are solely focused on enhancing passenger rail traffic to meet the increasing demand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While LEEP aims to improve freight transport efficiency, its scope is broader than just digitizing customs processes. It encompasses various measures to enhance the overall efficiency of the logistics sector, including infrastructure improvements, technological upgrades, and policy reforms.  Digitization of customs is one component, but not the primary focus.

Statement 2 is correct. PM GatiShakti is a comprehensive national master plan that integrates infrastructure development across various ministries.  This integrated approach aims to improve the efficiency of logistics by ensuring seamless coordination among different modes of transportation and infrastructure projects.  It seeks to optimize infrastructure development and reduce bottlenecks in the logistics chain.


**3. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources and their exploration, consider the following statements:**

2.  Geological Survey of India has identified significant reserves of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts primarily off the coast of Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957.  This exclusion is crucial as these resources often require different regulatory frameworks and extraction methodologies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Geological Survey of India has indeed delineated resources of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts, these are primarily found in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not off the coast of Gujarat and Maharashtra.  The Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts are known for other offshore mineral resources like lime mud and construction-grade sand.


**4. With reference to the IMF's lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1. The General Resources Account (GRA) provides concessional financial support at zero interest rates, primarily to low-income countries.
2. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) offers longer-term financing at affordable interest rates to both low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The General Resources Account (GRA) operates on non-concessional terms, meaning it uses market-based interest rates.  It is not specifically targeted at low-income countries and doesn't offer zero interest rates.  Concessional financing is provided through other IMF instruments like the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).

Statement 2 is correct. The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) is designed to provide longer-term financing at affordable interest rates. Its target audience includes both low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, recognizing that these nations may face unique challenges in building resilience against external shocks.  The affordable interest rates are a key feature, differentiating it from the GRA.


**5. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP aims to reduce the annual guarantee issuance to $10 billion by 2030 by streamlining the guarantee process.
2. The WBG-GP consolidates all guarantee products and experts from across the WBG institutions at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) aims to *increase*, not reduce, the annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030. This ambitious target reflects the World Bank's commitment to supporting private sector development and infrastructure projects, particularly those facing significant risks.  Consolidation and streamlining are expected to facilitate this increase.

Statement 2 is correct. A core function of the WBG-GP is to centralize all guarantee products and expertise within the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This consolidation is intended to improve efficiency, reduce duplication, and enhance the overall effectiveness of the World Bank's guarantee programs.

1. The MSP covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops, but excludes pulses.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MSP system in India covers a range of crops, including Kharif (monsoon season) crops, Rabi (winter season) crops, and some commercial crops.  The total number is 22. While pulses are important crops, they are included within the MSP framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CACP recommends MSPs based on its cost calculations, the final decision on MSPs rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  The CCEA considers the CACP's recommendations but also takes into account other economic factors and policy considerations.



**8.  With reference to India's steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption significantly surpasses the world average, indicating high domestic demand.
2.  The high energy intensity of steel production makes the sector particularly vulnerable to carbon taxes imposed by importing countries like the European Union.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. For Miniratna Category-I status, the minimum pre-tax profit requirement is ₹30 crore, not ₹20 crore, in at least one of the last three years.  This numerical difference is significant in assessing eligibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  To be eligible for Navratna status, a CPSE needs an 'excellent' or 'very good' MoU rating in *three* of the last five years, not just two. This difference in the number of years highlights the stringency of the criteria for achieving Navratna status.  Both statements contain errors, making (d) the correct option.  The question assesses the candidate's detailed understanding of the criteria for achieving different categories of CPSE recognition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the outlay. The scheme's total outlay is ₹1,702 crore, not ₹1,500 crore.  The precise amount is a significant detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the scheme includes the development of 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip', it is not limited to only these species; it aims to eventually cover other livestock as well.  The scope of the initiative is broader than what the statement suggests.  Both statements contain factual errors, making (d) the correct answer. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the scope and budget of the livestock health and production scheme.

2. According to the PLFS, the unemployment rate in India for the calendar year 2023 was approximately 2.9%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the year of launch. The PLFS was launched in 2017, not 2018.  The launch year is a significant detail. While the sample size is large, the statement's claim of "approximately 1 lakh households" is an oversimplification.  The PLFS uses a complex multi-stage stratified sampling design resulting in a much larger effective sample size.

Statement 2 is incorrect about the unemployment rate.  According to the PLFS, the unemployment rate for the calendar year 2023 was 3.1%, not approximately 2.9%.  The unemployment rate is a key indicator and its precise value is important.  Both statements contain inaccuracies, leading to (d) as the correct answer.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative, not bilateral, involving India and four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand).  It aims to interconnect domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) for faster cross-border payments. The statement incorrectly limits the scope to only India and Singapore.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the BIS did conceptualize Project Nexus through its Innovation Hub, its headquarters are located in Basel, Switzerland, not Frankfurt, Germany. The statement provides an incorrect location for the BIS headquarters.  The BIS is owned by 63 central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is a significant detail omitted from the incorrect statement.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations:**

1. SEBI's (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024 amended the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 1999.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SEBI did indeed issue the (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, to amend the existing SEBI (FVCI) Regulations. The original regulations were enacted in 2000, not 1999 as stated in the incorrect option.  The amendment reflects SEBI's ongoing efforts to regulate foreign investment in India's financial markets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) are specifically designed for *high-risk, high-return* investments, typically in startups and early-stage companies.  The statement misrepresents the core risk profile and investment strategy of VCFs.  The high-risk nature is a key feature distinguishing them from other investment vehicles.


**3. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All seven CRAs registered with SEBI—Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, INFOMERICS, and Brickwork—are accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2. SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 2000 mandate the disclosure of rating criteria, methodology, and conflict of interest guidelines by CRAs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While six of the seven CRAs mentioned are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions, Brickwork Ratings is *not* included in this list. The statement presents an inaccurate claim about the universal RBI accreditation of all SEBI-registered CRAs.

Statement 2 is correct. The SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999 (not 2000 as stated incorrectly), do indeed require CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policies, and guidelines for managing conflicts of interest. This transparency is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of credit ratings in the Indian financial system.


**4. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are investment vehicles similar to mutual funds that allow investors to invest in infrastructure projects such as toll roads and power plants, but exclude pipelines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. InvITs *do* include pipelines among the infrastructure projects they invest in.  The statement incorrectly excludes a significant category of infrastructure assets that InvITs commonly encompass, namely pipelines, which are crucial for energy and other sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI did indeed amend InvIT Regulations in 2024 to allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors solely for the acquisition of infrastructure projects. This amendment aimed to address valuation discrepancies between sponsors and InvITs during asset acquisitions, thus facilitating smoother transactions in the infrastructure investment market.


**5.  With reference to the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK), consider the following statements:**

1. The RRSK was launched in 2018-19 with an allocation of ₹1.5 lakh crore for a 10-year period to enhance railway safety infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RRSK was launched in 2017-18, not 2018-19, with an allocation of ₹1 lakh crore for a 5-year period (not 10 years). The statement contains errors regarding both the launch year and the fund allocation period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RRSK supports initiatives to improve railway safety, including the deployment of the KAVACH system, it doesn't solely focus on this single technology.  The fund encompasses a broader range of safety upgrades and infrastructure improvements across the Indian Railways network. The statement oversimplifies the RRSK's objectives and scope.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not 2020. The statement contains an error in the year of the Act's enactment.

Statement 2 is correct.  NaBFID has been notified as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013. While the exact percentage of government shareholding isn't explicitly stated, the fact that it's a PFI implies that the central government holds at least 51% of its paid-up share capital, fulfilling the criteria for PFI classification.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PLFS was launched in 2017, not 2018, to estimate key employment and unemployment indicators.  The statement contains an error in the launch year of the survey.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PLFS data for 2023 indicated a lower unemployment rate in India compared to the global unemployment rate. The statement misrepresents the comparative figures from the PLFS report.  The given information in the question presents an incorrect comparison of unemployment rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Space Policy 2023 actually *enables* end-to-end participation of NGEs in *all* domains of space activities, promoting private sector involvement. The statement presents the opposite of the policy's actual intent.

Statement 2 is correct.  A venture capital fund of ₹1,000 crore was indeed announced in Budget 2024-25 to provide financial support to space-tech startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  The statement accurately reflects a key government initiative to boost the private space sector.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF is a *multilateral* partnership, not bilateral, involving a larger number of countries and international organizations. It aims to assist LDCs in using trade as a tool for growth and development. The statement incorrectly describes the nature of the partnership.

Statement 2 is correct. UNOPS does indeed serve as the EIF Trust Fund Manager.  The statement accurately identifies the organization responsible for managing the EIF's trust fund.  The UNOPS role is crucial for the effective implementation of EIF-funded projects.


**11. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2022, to replace the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, not 2022. The statement contains an error in the year of the Act's enactment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the DBN replaced the USOF, which did use a Universal Access Levy, the DBN's funding mechanism is not specified in the provided text.  The statement provides incorrect information about the DBN's funding mechanism and the levy percentage.  The 5% levy was associated with the USOF, not the DBN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICI includes only *eight* core industries, and they represent approximately 40.27% of the IIP weight, not over 50%. The statement contains errors in both the number of industries and their contribution to the IIP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ICI is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the CSO.  The statement wrongly attributes the release of the ICI to the CSO.  The correct releasing authority is essential knowledge for aspirants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, drawing upon the WIPO's Paris and Berne Conventions.  A key feature is the allowance for compulsory licensing, enabling countries to produce patented goods without the patent holder's consent under certain conditions, particularly beneficial for developing nations.  This flexibility balances IPR protection with public interest concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the TRIPS Agreement does have a Council for TRIPS where members discuss issues related to the agreement, disputes regarding TRIPS obligations are ultimately subject to the WTO's established dispute settlement procedures.  The agreement's scope is broad, encompassing various forms of intellectual property, and it does *not* exclude agricultural products.  Agricultural products, especially genetically modified ones, are often subject to intellectual property rights.


**2. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF in India consistently remained above 25% of GDP from the 1980s until economic liberalization in the early 1990s, before experiencing a significant decline in the 2010s.
2.  The recent sluggish growth of private GFCF as a percentage of GDP is primarily attributed to increased government spending on infrastructure projects, which crowds out private investment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF did rise to around 27% of GDP in 2007-08, it was not consistently above 25% from the 1980s.  In fact, for a considerable period after independence and before economic liberalization, it remained closer to or slightly above/below 10% of GDP. The significant decline occurred from 2011-12 onwards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The sluggish growth in private GFCF is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors. While increased government spending *could* potentially crowd out private investment in certain sectors, this is not the primary or sole reason for the overall decline. Other factors such as economic uncertainty, policy changes, and global economic conditions play a more significant role.


**3. With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1.  The framework's two-pillar approach focuses solely on implementing a global minimum corporate tax (GMCT) of 15%, leaving the reallocation of profits from multinational enterprises (MNEs) to the jurisdictions where their consumers are located to be addressed by individual countries.
2.  India's participation in the framework is limited to the implementation of the GMCT, while it has opted out of the Pillar One initiative concerning profit reallocation due to concerns about its impact on domestic businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS indeed has a two-pillar approach, but both pillars are crucial. Pillar One focuses on the reallocation of profits from the largest and most profitable MNEs to countries where their consumers are present. Pillar Two is about the global minimum corporate tax (GMCT).  They are complementary, not mutually exclusive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is actively involved in both pillars of the BEPS Inclusive Framework.  It's a participant in the global effort to address base erosion and profit shifting,  working towards implementing both the profit reallocation mechanisms of Pillar One and the GMCT of Pillar Two.


**4. With reference to the Duty Drawback scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Duty Drawback scheme, under Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1962, only rebates customs duties levied on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods, excluding any excise duties on domestically produced materials.
2.  The recent move by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) to electronically disburse drawback amounts directly into exporters' bank accounts aims to expedite the process and reduce bureaucratic delays, while simultaneously increasing the amount of drawback available.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Duty Drawback scheme rebates customs duties on *both* imported and excisable (domestically produced) materials used in the manufacture of export goods. The aim is to neutralize the impact of indirect taxes on export competitiveness.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CBIC's initiative to electronically disburse duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts is designed to streamline the process, making it faster and more transparent. This reduces delays associated with traditional methods and enhances efficiency for exporters. The amount of drawback itself remains determined by existing regulations and isn't increased by this disbursement method.


**5. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement aims to eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies, regardless of their environmental impact, to ensure the long-term sustainability of fish stocks.
2. India's opposition to the Agreement stems primarily from its concern that the Agreement's provisions disproportionately impact developing countries and that it doesn't sufficiently address the historical overfishing practices of developed nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies targets *harmful* fisheries subsidies, those contributing to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks.  It doesn't call for the elimination of all subsidies, recognizing that some might have positive impacts, such as those supporting sustainable fishing practices.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's concerns regarding the Agreement focus on the differential impact on developing nations and the need for a more equitable approach that considers the historical responsibilities of developed countries for overfishing.  India advocates for special and differential treatment (S&DT) to accommodate the needs of developing countries and emphasizes the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR).  The "polluter pays principle" is also central to India's position.



**1. With reference to India's trade deficit, consider the following statements:**

1. A widening current account deficit, often associated with a high trade deficit, can lead to a decrease in a country's credit rating and increased borrowing costs.
2.  A higher trade deficit always negatively impacts the domestic economy by depleting foreign exchange reserves and leading to currency depreciation, with no potential offsetting benefits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A persistent and large trade deficit contributes significantly to a wider current account deficit.  Credit rating agencies assess a nation's economic stability, including its ability to manage its external debt.  A large current account deficit signals a potential vulnerability, as it implies the country is relying heavily on foreign borrowing or capital inflows to finance its spending. This can lead to a downgrade in the country's credit rating, making it more expensive to borrow money internationally, as lenders perceive a higher risk.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a high trade deficit does carry negative consequences such as depletion of foreign exchange reserves and potential currency depreciation, it's not universally detrimental.  There can be positive aspects.  For instance, increased imports of capital goods can boost domestic investment and long-term productivity growth.  Access to a wider range of goods can benefit consumers and increase overall welfare.  The net impact of a trade deficit depends on the underlying factors driving it and the overall economic context.  A temporary trade deficit to facilitate necessary investments might be a positive sign of future growth, while a persistent and large deficit fueled by unsustainable consumption could be damaging.


**2. With reference to the RoDTEP scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The RoDTEP scheme, launched by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, aims to refund all indirect taxes levied on exported goods, ensuring complete tax neutrality for exporters.
2. The RoDTEP scheme replaced the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), aiming to provide a more streamlined and transparent mechanism for export incentives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RoDTEP scheme aims to refund taxes, duties, and levies on exported products, it doesn't cover *all* indirect taxes. The scheme focuses on reimbursing those taxes embedded in the exported products, aiming to level the playing field for Indian exporters in the international market.  It doesn't aim for complete tax neutrality in all aspects.  Some indirect taxes might still be applicable depending on specific circumstances and regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. The RoDTEP scheme was indeed introduced as a replacement for the MEIS scheme.  The MEIS scheme, while providing export incentives, was criticised for its complexity and lack of transparency. The RoDTEP scheme aimed to address these shortcomings by providing a more streamlined and transparent mechanism for refunding embedded taxes and levies, thereby promoting exports more efficiently.



**3. With reference to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the nodal department responsible for formulating FDI policy in India, and all FDI proposals require government approval before being implemented.
2. FDI is permitted in India through two routes: the automatic route, which doesn't require government approval, and the government route, which does require such approval.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While DPIIT is the nodal department for formulating FDI policy, not all FDI proposals require government approval.  A significant portion of FDI inflows comes through the automatic route, where investments are permitted without prior government approval. This streamlines the investment process and encourages foreign investment.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian government allows FDI through two distinct routes: the automatic route and the government route. The automatic route simplifies the process, allowing investors to proceed without seeking specific approvals.  The government route, however, requires government approval and is generally used for investments in sectors or projects deemed sensitive or requiring special consideration due to strategic or policy implications.


**4. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus, an initiative of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), aims to interconnect domestic instant payment systems (IPS) across several countries, including India and four ASEAN nations, to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border retail payments.
2.  Project Nexus, once fully operational, will directly replace all existing bilateral agreements and mechanisms for cross-border payments between participating countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project Nexus is indeed a multilateral initiative conceived by the BIS's Innovation Hub. Its primary goal is to link various domestic instant payment systems (like UPI in India) to create a seamless network for faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border retail payments.  The project involves India and four ASEAN countries initially, with the aim of expanding further.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Project Nexus does not aim to replace all existing bilateral agreements or payment mechanisms.  Instead, it acts as a supplementary initiative to improve the efficiency and accessibility of cross-border payments by providing a more integrated and standardized system. Existing bilateral arrangements could still be used in parallel or for specific transactions not covered by Project Nexus.


**5. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendment primarily aims to tighten regulations on Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) operating in India, restricting their investment options and increasing compliance requirements.
2.  The amendments brought about by the 2024 regulations ensure that India's regulatory framework for FVCIs is fully compliant with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) minimum standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 amendment to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, didn't primarily aim to tighten restrictions on FVCIs or increase compliance burdens.  The focus was on aligning India's regulatory framework with international best practices, specifically concerning BEPS standards. While some clarifications and modifications were introduced, it wasn't a major overhaul geared towards stricter controls.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of the 2024 amendment was to ensure compliance with the BEPS minimum standards.  This is crucial for attracting foreign investment and maintaining India's reputation as a stable and transparent investment destination.  The BEPS initiative focuses on preventing tax avoidance by multinational enterprises, and aligning with its standards enhances India's credibility in international financial markets.


**6. With reference to the One Future Alliance, consider the following statements:**

1. The One Future Alliance is an initiative proposed by the G20 India Presidency, focused solely on providing financial assistance to low and middle-income countries (LMICs) for the implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).
2. The One Future Alliance is a voluntary initiative, aiming to build capacity and provide technical assistance, alongside financial support, to LMICs in implementing DPI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The One Future Alliance, while focused on supporting LMICs in adopting DPI, does not limit its support to purely financial assistance.  It encompasses a broader approach, including capacity building and technical assistance alongside financial support. The integrated strategy aims to ensure successful and sustainable DPI implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The One Future Alliance is explicitly characterized as a voluntary initiative.  Participation is based on the willingness of nations to collaborate and share their expertise in the development and deployment of DPI. The voluntary nature allows for flexible participation and tailoring support to the specific needs of individual countries.


**7. With reference to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), consider the following statements:**

1. NPCI was incorporated in 2008 under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, and is wholly owned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. NPCI is an umbrella organization operating retail payments and settlement systems in India, and it developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NPCI was indeed incorporated in 2008 under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, it's not wholly owned by the RBI.  It's jointly owned by the RBI and a consortium of Indian banks. This collaborative ownership structure reflects the diverse stakeholders involved in the Indian payments ecosystem.

Statement 2 is correct. NPCI is the primary entity responsible for operating various retail payments and settlement systems within India.  Among its notable achievements is the development and launch of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which has revolutionized digital payments in the country.


**8. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  India Stack, India's foundational DPI, consists of only two interconnected layers: the identity layer (e.g., Aadhaar) and the payment layer (e.g., UPI).
2. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR), announced at the G20 virtual leaders' summit in 2023, aims to establish a focused institution for research and development in DPI technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India Stack, the foundational DPI of India, comprises three, not two, interconnected layers: the identity layer (Aadhaar), the payment layer (UPI), and a crucial data governance layer (e.g., DigiLocker). The data governance layer is essential for ensuring data privacy, security, and interoperability across different services built on India Stack.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GDPIR was indeed announced at the 2023 G20 summit with the aim of creating a dedicated institution. This institution will focus on facilitating the implementation and expansion of DPI globally, helping to share knowledge, best practices, and support the adoption of DPI in various countries.


**9. With reference to the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  From India's independence until economic liberalization, the GFCF consistently remained below 10% of GDP.
2.  The GFCF, as a percentage of GDP, reached its peak in 2007-08 and has steadily declined since then.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GFCF fluctuated, it didn't consistently remain below 10% of GDP during the period from independence to economic liberalization.  There were periods of higher investment, though often influenced by various economic factors and government policies. The statement oversimplifies a complex trend.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GFCF experienced a decline after reaching a peak around 2007-08, it didn't steadily decline.  There were periods of fluctuations and even some increases after the initial dip. The statement misrepresents the dynamic nature of GFCF trends, which are subject to various economic cycles and policy changes.


**10. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is primarily responsible for providing short-term loans and credit facilities to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in infrastructure projects.
2. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID's mandate is not limited to short-term financing for SMEs.  Its focus is on long-term, non-recourse infrastructure financing, aiming to support large-scale infrastructure projects.  While SMEs might indirectly benefit from the broader impact of NaBFID's activities, they are not its primary target.

Statement 2 is correct. NaBFID is indeed regulated and supervised by the RBI as an AIFI under sections 45L and 45N of the RBI Act, 1934. This regulatory oversight ensures that NaBFID operates within a robust framework, promoting financial stability and responsible lending practices within the crucial infrastructure sector.


**11. With reference to India's e-commerce market, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian e-commerce market is currently dominated by the inventory-based model, where e-commerce entities directly own and sell goods to consumers.
2.  100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted under the automatic route for the marketplace-based model of e-commerce in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While inventory-based e-commerce exists in India, the market is predominantly driven by the marketplace model. In the marketplace model, e-commerce platforms act as intermediaries connecting buyers and sellers, unlike the inventory-based model where the platform directly holds and sells inventory.  This reflects the structure of the Indian e-commerce sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian government permits 100% FDI under the automatic route for the marketplace model of e-commerce. This policy aims to encourage foreign investment in this sector while protecting the interests of domestic businesses.  The automatic route simplifies investment procedures and promotes growth.


**12. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  A DTAA is an agreement between two countries designed to eliminate double taxation on the same income earned within each country's jurisdiction.
2.  The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA included the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to prevent treaty abuse for tax evasion purposes, ensuring compliance with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) minimum standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DTAAs are specifically designed to prevent double taxation.  This occurs when income is taxed twice—once in the country where it's earned (source country) and again in the country of residence of the taxpayer.  DTAAs aim to allocate the taxing rights fairly, preventing undue tax burdens on individuals or businesses.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA did indeed include the PPT. The PPT is a crucial component of the BEPS minimum standards, designed to prevent taxpayers from exploiting treaty provisions to avoid paying taxes legitimately owed.  By incorporating the PPT, the revised DTAA ensures that tax benefits are granted only when the principal purpose of a transaction or arrangement is not solely to obtain such benefits.


**13. With reference to the India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX), consider the following statements:**

1. The IIBX, established at the GIFT International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  The IIBX aims to promote transparency and efficiency in India's bullion market, offering a platform for trading in physical gold and silver.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IIBX is not regulated by SEBI.  It's regulated by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), which oversees the regulatory framework for financial activities within the GIFT IFSC.  This reflects the unique regulatory structure of the IFSC.

Statement 2 is correct. The IIBX was established to enhance the transparency and efficiency of India's bullion market.  It provides a regulated platform for trading in physical gold and silver, promoting fair pricing, reducing market manipulation, and improving overall market integrity.


**14. With reference to Carry Trade, consider the following statements:**

1. Carry trade is an investment strategy primarily associated with equity markets, involving borrowing at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding stocks.
2. Carry trade is generally considered a low-risk investment strategy due to its reliance on predictable interest rate differentials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Carry trade is primarily associated with foreign exchange markets, not equity markets. It involves borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a high-interest-rate currency or asset, aiming to profit from the interest rate differential.  The strategy leverages currency fluctuations and interest rate differences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Carry trade is considered a high-risk strategy, not low-risk.  This is because it's highly susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates and unexpected changes in interest rates.  Adverse movements in either of these can significantly reduce or even eliminate profits, leading to substantial losses for the investor.  The risk is amplified by the use of leverage, which magnifies both gains and losses.


**15. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership focused exclusively on providing financial aid to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to help them overcome trade barriers.
2.  The EIF is supported by various international organizations, including the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and involves a large number of partner countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the EIF does assist LDCs in overcoming trade barriers, its scope is not limited to just financial aid.  It adopts a holistic approach, providing technical assistance and capacity building, along with support in trade policy formulation and implementation.  The support is not solely financial.

Statement 2 is correct. The EIF is indeed a multilateral partnership supported by various international organizations, including the World Bank and WTO.  The collaboration reflects the collective commitment to help LDCs leverage trade for sustainable development.  The framework also involves a significant number of partner countries, highlighting the broad-based global support.


**16. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replacing the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), and is primarily funded through a levy on the gross revenue of all telecom companies.
2. The DBN aims to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas at affordable prices, thereby promoting digital connectivity across the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DBN was indeed established through the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replacing the USOF.  However, the primary funding mechanism isn't a levy on the *gross* revenue of all telecom companies.  The exact funding mechanism is more nuanced and not simply a percentage of gross revenue across the board.

Statement 2 is correct. The DBN's core objective is to fund telecom infrastructure development and services in underserved areas, making digital connectivity more accessible and affordable for citizens in those regions.  This aligns with the broader goal of bridging the digital divide within the country.


**17. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE for AVGC-XR was established as a government-owned and operated public sector undertaking (PSU) under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
2.  The NCoE for AVGC-XR is intended to foster growth and innovation in the AVGC-XR sector, promoting skill development, research, and collaboration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE for AVGC-XR is not a government-owned PSU.  It's set up as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013.  This structure allows for greater flexibility and private sector participation in its operations while still aligning with the overall objectives of supporting the AVGC-XR sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary goal of the NCoE is to drive growth and innovation within the AVGC-XR sector.  It aims to achieve this through various initiatives, such as skill development programs, fostering research and development, and facilitating collaborations between industry players and academic institutions.


**1. With reference to the National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NADCP aims to control and eradicate Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis in India.
2.  The program utilizes a comprehensive vaccination strategy, focusing primarily on adult cattle and buffaloes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NADCP's primary objective is the control and eradication of FMD and Brucellosis in India.  This is a significant national initiative to improve livestock health and productivity.  The program involves a multi-pronged approach including vaccination, surveillance, and disease management strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While vaccination is a crucial component of the NADCP, it doesn't solely focus on adult cattle and buffaloes. The program employs a broader vaccination strategy encompassing different age groups of livestock to achieve herd immunity and effective disease control.  The age-specific vaccination strategies may vary depending on the disease and regional variations in disease prevalence.  Furthermore, the program includes other crucial elements beyond vaccination, such as strengthening surveillance systems and improving animal husbandry practices.  Therefore, focusing solely on adult animals is a misrepresentation of the program's comprehensive approach.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Rashtriya Gokul Mission:**

1. The mission primarily focuses on improving the productivity of indigenous bovine breeds through selective breeding and genetic improvement programs.
2.  The mission aims to establish a nationwide network of Gokul Gram, each specializing in the conservation and development of a specific indigenous cattle breed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rashtriya Gokul Mission's core objective is to enhance the productivity of indigenous cattle breeds. This involves various strategies, including the improvement of breeding practices, genetic enhancement, and promoting better animal husbandry techniques.  The mission aims to improve the overall quality and yield of milk and other livestock products from these breeds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rashtriya Gokul Mission promotes the conservation and development of indigenous cattle breeds, it doesn't specifically focus on establishing a nationwide network of Gokul Gram, each dedicated to a single breed. The mission's approach is more comprehensive, involving various initiatives across different regions and breeds.  The establishment of Gokul Gram might be a localized initiative under the broader umbrella of the mission, but it's not a defining characteristic or the primary strategy of the national program. The program focuses on a holistic approach to improve the genetic pool and overall health of indigenous breeds.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ‘Gau Chip’ for cattle and ‘Mahish Chip’ for buffaloes are indeed unified genomic chips. These technologies are designed to improve traceability and genetic management within the livestock sector. This involves tracking individual animals throughout their life cycle, enabling better monitoring of their health and genetic characteristics.

Statement 2 is also correct. The chips store crucial information, including parentage, breed, and disease history. This data is essential for implementing efficient disease surveillance and control measures.  By tracking disease outbreaks and identifying carriers, authorities can take swift action to prevent wider spread and minimize economic losses.  This detailed information is also valuable for improving breeding strategies and overall genetic management of the livestock population.


**4. With reference to the Pandemic Fund Project launched by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, consider the following statements:**

1. The project is solely funded by the Indian government to strengthen animal health security in India.
2.  A major intervention under the project involves upgrading animal health laboratories and vaccine manufacturing facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pandemic Fund Project is not solely funded by the Indian government.  It's a $25 million initiative primarily funded by the G20 Pandemic Fund, established under Indonesia's G20 Presidency in 2022. While India is a beneficiary and participant, the funding source is international.  This highlights the global collaboration involved in addressing pandemic preparedness and response in the animal health sector.

Statement 2 is correct. Upgrading animal health laboratories and vaccine manufacturing facilities is a key intervention under the project.  Improving infrastructure is critical for enhancing the capacity to detect, respond to, and prevent outbreaks of animal diseases, thereby protecting both animal health and public health.  This investment in infrastructure directly contributes to strengthening the country's overall animal health security.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) are *not* allowed to accept demand deposits from the public. This is a key difference between NBFCs and banks.  Banks can accept demand deposits, which are deposits that can be withdrawn on demand, while NBFCs cannot.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the nature and risk profile of these financial institutions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The deposit insurance facility of DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation) is *not* available to depositors of NBFCs.  DICGC insurance covers deposits in banks, but not in NBFCs.  This means that depositors in NBFCs face a higher level of risk compared to depositors in banks, as their deposits are not insured by DICGC.


**26. With reference to Scale-Based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs, consider the following statements:**

1.  SBR categorizes NBFCs into three layers based on their size and perceived risk.
2.  Each tier under SBR is subject to different regulatory requirements tailored to its risk profile.

The number of layers is a crucial detail in understanding the granularity and effectiveness of the regulatory framework.  The four-tier structure allows for a more nuanced approach to regulation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Under SBR, each tier of NBFCs is indeed subject to different regulatory requirements.  These requirements are tailored to the specific risk profile of each tier, ensuring that the regulatory burden is proportionate to the level of risk posed by the NBFC.  This risk-based approach is aimed at enhancing the stability and safety of the NBFC sector.


**27. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  NPAs are loans or advances where interest and/or principal repayments are overdue for less than 90 days.
2.  High NPAs indicate a healthy financial condition of banks and financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NPAs (Non-Performing Assets) are loans or advances where interest and/or principal repayments are overdue for *more than* 90 days, not less than 90 days.  The 90-day threshold is a crucial defining characteristic of an NPA.  Loans with overdue payments for less than 90 days are usually classified as standard assets.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. High NPAs indicate a *weak* or unhealthy financial condition of banks and financial institutions.  A high level of NPAs reflects a significant portion of the loan portfolio that is not generating returns.  This can lead to reduced profitability and even threaten the financial stability of the institution.  Low NPAs are a sign of good financial health.


**1. With reference to India's oilseed production, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) exclusively focuses on providing Minimum Support Price (MSP) for oilseeds through price deficiency payments, excluding price support schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the goals and geographical focus of the NMEO-OP. The initiative explicitly targets an expansion of oil palm cultivation to 10 lakh hectares by 2025-26, with a specific emphasis on the North Eastern States and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. This strategic focus aims to leverage the agro-climatic suitability of these regions for oil palm cultivation and boost domestic oil production.  The initiative's success would contribute significantly to reducing India's dependence on edible oil imports.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PM-AASHA does aim to ensure that oilseed farmers receive the MSP, it achieves this through *both* price support schemes and price deficiency payment schemes. The statement incorrectly limits the scheme's mechanisms to only price deficiency payments, omitting a key component of its operational strategy.  The dual approach of PM-AASHA is crucial for providing comprehensive support to oilseed farmers and ensuring fair prices.


**3. With reference to the current status of millet production in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India accounts for approximately 80% of Asia's and 20% of the global millet production, yet acreage and production have remained largely stagnant in recent years.
2.  The stagnation in millet production is primarily attributed to the high yield obtained from millet cultivation, making it less economically attractive compared to other crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the current situation of millet production in India.  The text clearly states that India holds a dominant position in global millet production, accounting for a significant share of both Asian and global output. However, it also highlights the concerning stagnation in acreage and production, indicating a lack of growth despite the existing market dominance.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  100% FDI under the automatic route is permitted for *marketplace-based* e-commerce models, not inventory-based models.  Restrictions on inventory-based models aim to protect domestic retailers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Draft e-Commerce Policy aims to create a *facilitative*, not restrictive, regulatory environment to promote the growth of the e-commerce sector while addressing concerns about consumer protection and fair competition.


**17. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FI-Index is published biannually by the Ministry of Finance.
2.  The FI-Index incorporates details from the banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FI-Index is published *annually* by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not biannually by the Ministry of Finance.  The RBI's role reflects its responsibility for overseeing the financial system.

Statement 2 is correct. The FI-Index indeed includes data from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors, providing a comprehensive view of financial inclusion across various aspects of the financial landscape.


**18. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RB-IOS covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) regardless of their asset size.
2.  The RB-IOS aims to provide a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer grievances related to services provided by regulated entities of the RBI.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS covers only certain NBFCs, specifically those authorized to accept deposits or have customer interfaces, and with assets of ₹100 crore and above.  Smaller NBFCs are not covered under this scheme.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of the RB-IOS is to offer a cost-effective and accessible avenue for resolving customer complaints related to services provided by RBI-regulated entities.  It aims to provide timely and fair redressal.


**19. With reference to Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  A UCB can accept deposits from and lend to non-members.
2.  A UCB must have a minimum of two hundred members and net owned funds of ten lakh rupees or more.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  UCBs are typically restricted to accepting deposits from and lending to their *members* only, focusing on mutual benefit within their membership base.  This characteristic distinguishes them from commercial banks.

Statement 2 is correct. The specified minimum number of members and net owned funds are indeed criteria for a UCB's establishment and operation, reflecting regulatory requirements for financial stability and operational capacity.


**20. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ISI mark is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for all products sold in India.
2.  The ISI mark is mandatory only for certain specified products under Quality Control Orders (QCOs).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not issued for *all* products sold in India.  It is a certification mark that indicates compliance with specific standards for particular products.  Many products are not subject to mandatory ISI marking.

Statement 2 is correct. The government mandates ISI marking for specific products through QCOs issued under the BIS Act. This selective approach targets products where quality and safety are of paramount importance.


**21. With reference to "Green Shoots" in the context of the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1.  "Green Shoots" refers to early signs of economic recovery after a period of economic stagnation.
2.  The RBI recently identified the FMCG sector as exhibiting "Green Shoots" indicating strong economic growth across all sectors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. "Green Shoots" is a term used to describe early indicators of economic recovery or growth after a period of economic downturn or stagnation.  It suggests positive trends that may signal a broader economic revival.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI noted the rural economy's positive contribution to the FMCG sector, this doesn't imply that all sectors are experiencing strong growth.  The RBI's observation was specific to a particular sector and doesn't represent a generalized economic trend.


**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EIF is a multilateral partnership exclusively focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade for sustainable development and poverty reduction.
2.  The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) acts as the EIF Trust Fund Manager, and the World Bank and World Trade Organization (WTO) provide financial support to the EIF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The EIF's core mandate is to help LDCs leverage trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  It is explicitly designed as a multilateral partnership dedicated to this specific goal.

Statement 2 is also correct. UNOPS manages the EIF Trust Fund, and the World Bank and WTO are among the international organizations that support the EIF's activities.  While the UNOPS manages the fund, other organizations contribute to its financial stability and operational capacity.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the EIF.  Option (c) is the most appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DBN was established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replacing the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded by a levy on telecom licensees' gross revenue.
2.  The DBN's primary objective is to fund telecom projects in underserved urban areas to bridge the digital divide and improve connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, indeed replaced the USOF.  The USOF was funded by a levy (Universal Access Levy) on the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.  This accurately reflects the shift from USOF to DBN and the funding mechanism of the previous fund.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DBN's focus is on underserved *rural* and remote areas, not urban areas.  The aim is to expand telecom infrastructure and services to areas lacking adequate connectivity, primarily targeting rural populations.  This is a crucial distinction that makes statement 2 inaccurate. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the DBN's geographical focus or the accuracy of both statements.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for AVGC-XR, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCoE for AVGC-XR will be established as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, with the provisional name "Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC)."
2.  The creation of the NCoE for AVGC-XR was proposed in the 2023-24 budget, following the establishment of an AVGC task force in 2021.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The NCoE for AVGC-XR is indeed planned as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, with the provisional name "Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC)." This reflects the legal structure and intended identity of the NCoE.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The proposal for the NCoE for AVGC-XR originated in the 2022-23 budget, not the 2023-24 budget. The AVGC task force was also established in 2022, not 2021. The timeline presented in statement 2 is inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the right choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the timing of the budget proposal or the accuracy of both statements.


**4. With reference to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)'s role in transforming the insurance sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  Insurance penetration in India increased significantly from 2.71% in 2001-02 to 4.2% in 2021-22, demonstrating IRDAI's success in expanding insurance coverage.
2.  IRDAI aims to achieve "Insurance for All" by 2047, ensuring every citizen has comprehensive life, health, and property insurance coverage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided figures accurately reflect the growth in insurance penetration in India during the specified period.  This increase indicates a positive impact of IRDAI's regulatory efforts in expanding insurance coverage across the country.

Statement 2 is also correct. IRDAI has publicly stated its goal of achieving "Insurance for All" by 2047, aiming to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to all Indian citizens. This ambitious goal reflects IRDAI's long-term vision for the insurance sector in India.  Both statements accurately reflect IRDAI's contribution to the insurance sector's growth and its future objectives.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not fully capture the accuracy of both statements regarding IRDAI's impact and goals.


**5. With reference to the World Bank's Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The B-Ready Index is a three-year project (2024-2026) that assesses the business and investment climate in 50 economies, including India.
2. The B-Ready Index replaced the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings due to concerns about data irregularities and ethical issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The B-Ready Index, in its initial rollout phase, *excludes* India among its 50 assessed economies.  The statement incorrectly includes India in the list of assessed countries.

Statement 2 is correct. The World Bank discontinued the EoDB rankings due to documented irregularities and ethical concerns. The B-Ready Index was introduced as a successor, aiming to improve the methodology and address the previous shortcomings. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the accurate option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the inclusion of India in the index or the reasons for the EoDB's discontinuation.


**6. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) provides concessional loans to low-income countries at market-based interest rates.
2.  The Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) offers longer-term financing to both low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to build resilience against external shocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PRGT provides concessional financing, meaning loans at *below*-market interest rates (currently zero). The statement incorrectly attributes market-based interest rates to PRGT loans.

Statement 2 is correct.  The RST does indeed provide longer-term financing to both low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to help them build resilience against external economic shocks. This accurately describes the RST's target beneficiaries and its objective.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the interest rates of PRGT loans or the accuracy of both statements.


**7. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP aims to increase the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $10 billion by 2030.
2. The WBG-GP consolidates all guarantee products and experts from across the World Bank Group institutions under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP's aim is to significantly increase the World Bank Group's annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030, not $10 billion.  This is a crucial numerical difference that makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The WBG-GP brings together all guarantee products and related expertise from various World Bank Group institutions under the umbrella of MIGA. This centralized approach streamlines operations and enhances efficiency. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the target guarantee issuance amount or the accuracy of both statements.


**8. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market; India's GII ranking improved significantly in 2022.
2.  The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the loss in Human Development Index (HDI) due to inequality; India's IHDI rank improved in 2022 compared to previous years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GII does indeed measure gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market.  The provided information correctly reflects India's improvement in its GII ranking in 2022.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that India's IHDI rank *declined* in 2022, not improved. The statement misrepresents the trend in India's IHDI ranking.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the trend in India's IHDI ranking or the accuracy of both statements.


**9. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2024 report, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 MPI report, jointly published by the UNDP and OPHI, found that approximately 1.2 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
2.  India had the highest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty among the 112 countries included in the 2024 MPI report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report indicates that approximately 1.1 billion people, not 1.2 billion, live in acute multidimensional poverty across the 112 countries surveyed.  The statement presents an inaccurate figure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report correctly identifies India as the country with the largest number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty among the countries assessed. This accurately reflects a key finding of the 2024 MPI report.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the right option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the number of people in acute multidimensional poverty or the accuracy of both statements.


**10. With reference to the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  From independence until economic liberalization, GFCF remained consistently below 10% of GDP.
2.  Private investment, as a percentage of GDP, declined significantly from 2011-12 onwards, reaching its lowest point in 2020-21 before showing signs of recovery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that GFCF fluctuated slightly above and below 10% of GDP during the period from independence to economic liberalization, not consistently below 10%. This is a crucial distinction that makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage accurately describes the decline in private investment as a percentage of GDP from 2011-12, reaching a low in 2020-21 before showing signs of subsequent recovery. This reflects a key trend in India's investment landscape. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the trend in GFCF before liberalization or the accuracy of both statements.


**11. With reference to the  Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty was adopted by consensus among less than 100 countries, including India.
2.  The treaty aims to enhance the transparency and quality of the patent system to prevent erroneous patent grants for non-novel inventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty was adopted by consensus among *more* than 150 countries, not less than 100. The statement incorrectly underestimates the number of countries involved in the adoption process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The treaty's objectives explicitly include enhancing the efficacy, transparency, and quality of the patent system to prevent the erroneous granting of patents for inventions that lack novelty.  This accurately reflects a key goal of the treaty. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the number of countries involved in the treaty's adoption or the accuracy of both statements.


**12. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMGS NMP is built on proprietary software and integrates data from various ministries, including those responsible for Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN projects.
2.  The PMGS NMP uses a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, utilizing a GIS platform and integrating ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP is explicitly built on *open-source* technology, not proprietary software. The statement incorrectly attributes proprietary software to the NMP's development.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the PMGS NMP's development using the Digital Master Planning tool by BISAG-N, its reliance on a GIS platform, and the integration of ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps. This accurately reflects the technological foundation of the NMP.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the right option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the software used in the NMP's development or the accuracy of both statements.


**13. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹5 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).
2.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level matters concerning PPPs, and the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct but contains a minor numerical inaccuracy. While the NMP does aim to generate investment by monetising government assets, the target amount is ₹6 lakh crore, not ₹5 lakh crore, over the four-year period (FY22 to FY25). However, this slight discrepancy doesn't invalidate the core meaning of the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs does handle policy-level PPP matters, and the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee does evaluate central sector PPP projects.  This accurately reflects the institutional framework for PPPs in India.  Since both statements are fundamentally accurate, despite a minor numerical error in statement 1, option (c) is the most appropriate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully capture the accuracy of both statements.


**14. With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The AoA's market access pillar includes tariffication, which involves converting all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, and tariff reduction to improve market access.
2.  The AoA's domestic support pillar categorizes subsidies based on their trade-distorting effects, and developed members have completely eliminated export subsidies as per the Nairobi Ministerial Decision 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AoA's market access component does indeed include tariffication (converting non-tariff barriers to tariffs) and tariff reduction to enhance market access for agricultural products. This accurately describes a key aspect of the AoA.

Statement 2 is also correct. The AoA's domestic support pillar uses different "boxes" to categorize subsidies based on their trade-distorting potential.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 did lead to the elimination of export subsidies by developed members.  Both statements reflect key elements of the AoA's structure and agreements. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not fully capture the accuracy of both statements regarding the AoA's provisions.


**15. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies to ensure sustainable fishing practices.
2.  The Agreement includes provisions for Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) for developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), allowing them a transition period to comply with the agreement's provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb *harmful* fisheries subsidies, not eliminate all forms of subsidies.  The agreement recognizes that some subsidies may have positive impacts and focuses on those subsidies that negatively impact fish stocks.

Statement 2 is correct. The Agreement does include provisions for S&DT for developing countries and LDCs, providing them with a transition period to adjust to the new regulations. This acknowledges the varying capacities and needs of different member countries. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope of the agreement or the accuracy of both statements.


**16. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The TRIPS Agreement was developed during the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2.  The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, enabling countries to produce patented products or processes without the consent of the patent holder under specific circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement was negotiated during the *Uruguay* Round of GATT, not the Tokyo Round.  This is a significant inaccuracy regarding the historical context of the TRIPS Agreement.

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement does indeed include provisions for compulsory licensing, allowing countries to produce patented goods or processes without the patent holder's consent under specific circumstances, particularly to address public health concerns or national emergencies. This is a key flexibility built into the agreement. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the GATT round during which TRIPS was negotiated or the accuracy of both statements.




**1. With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) under the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1.  The AoA's "Domestic Access" pillar focuses solely on export subsidies and their impact on global agricultural markets.
2.  Tariffication, a key component of the AoA's "Market Access" pillar, mandates the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Domestic Access" pillar of the AoA deals with subsidies and other support programs that directly stimulate production and distort trade, not solely export subsidies.  It encompasses various types of subsidies categorized into different "boxes" based on their characteristics and trade-distorting potential (e.g., green box, amber box, blue box).  Export subsidies are addressed under a separate pillar of the AoA, namely "Export Subsidies."

Statement 2 is correct. Tariffication, a core element of the "Market Access" pillar, requires the elimination of all non-tariff barriers (like quotas and variable levies) and their replacement with equivalent tariffs. This aims to create a more transparent and predictable trading environment for agricultural products.  This process was a significant undertaking during the Uruguay Round negotiations and continues to be a subject of debate and implementation challenges within the WTO.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package):**

1. The agreement, adopted in 2022, immediately came into effect upon ratification by two-thirds of WTO members.
2.  The agreement's Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) provisions grant developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) an extended transition period before full compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), while adopted in 2022,  requires ratification by two-thirds of WTO members before it enters into force.  As of December 2024 (as per the provided text), it was still short of the necessary number of ratifications.  The agreement's effectiveness hinges on broad participation and consensus among member states, reflecting the complex nature of global fisheries management and the diverse interests involved.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Geneva Package explicitly includes S&DT provisions, offering developing countries and LDCs a transition period to adapt to the new rules and regulations on fisheries subsidies.  This recognition of differing capacities and development needs is crucial for ensuring equitable participation and avoiding disproportionate burdens on less developed economies.  This approach reflects the WTO's broader commitment to accommodating the specific circumstances of its members.


**3. With reference to the Public Stockholding (PSH) policies for food security, consider the following statements:**

1. Developed countries generally support increased de minimis limits for PSH programs to allow developing countries greater flexibility in their domestic support policies.
2.  The current method of calculating the de minimis limit for PSH subsidies uses a reference price based on 1986-88 data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Developed countries generally oppose higher de minimis limits for PSH programs, arguing that such programs distort markets and provide an unfair advantage to developing countries. They contend that these programs should not be exempt from WTO rules, maintaining their stance that PSH constitutes a market-distorting practice. This reflects a persistent North-South divide on agricultural trade policies within the WTO.

Statement 2 is correct.  The calculation of the de minimis limit for PSH subsidies currently utilizes a reference price based on data from 1986-88. Developing countries argue that this outdated reference price is inadequate for assessing current production costs and necessitates an update to reflect contemporary realities. This discrepancy underscores the ongoing debate surrounding the appropriate methodology for calculating and applying subsidy caps within the WTO framework.


**4. With respect to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, enabling countries to produce patented products without the patent owner's consent under specific circumstances.
2. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement explicitly prohibits member countries from taking measures to protect public health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement does include provisions for compulsory licensing, which allows member countries to produce patented goods without the patent holder's permission under certain conditions, usually related to public health emergencies or national security. This flexibility is aimed at balancing intellectual property rights with the needs of developing countries.  The availability of compulsory licensing has been a significant point of contention in negotiations concerning access to essential medicines and technologies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement explicitly *affirms* that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to protect public health. It emphasizes the flexibility within the agreement to address public health concerns, particularly in the context of access to essential medicines.  This declaration attempted to resolve concerns that the TRIPS Agreement could unduly restrict countries' abilities to respond to health crises.


**5.  Regarding Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Private investment, as measured by GFCF as a percentage of GDP, consistently remained above 25% of GDP from the 1980s until 2020-21.
2. After economic liberalization, GFCF experienced a significant increase, reaching approximately 27% of GDP by 2007-08.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF as a percentage of GDP did rise significantly after economic liberalization, reaching approximately 27% by 2007-08, it did not consistently remain above 25% until 2020-21.  The provided text indicates a decline in private investment from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a low of 19.6% in 2020-21 before subsequently rising again.  This fluctuation highlights the volatility of private investment and its sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions.

Statement 2 is correct. The period following economic liberalization witnessed a substantial increase in GFCF in India.  This growth reflects increased investment in infrastructure, industry, and other sectors, contributing to the country's economic expansion.  However, the sustained high levels of GFCF observed in the period leading up to 2007-08 were not maintained in subsequent years.


**6. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The global MPI uses indicators exclusively focused on economic aspects of poverty, neglecting social and environmental factors.
2. According to the World Bank’s report, "Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet," global poverty reduction has significantly advanced in the last five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The global MPI is a multidimensional measure that considers deprivations across multiple dimensions, including education, health, and living standards. It is not solely focused on economic aspects of poverty but also incorporates social and environmental factors. This holistic approach contrasts with traditional measures of poverty that primarily rely on income or consumption levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The World Bank’s report, "Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet," indicates that global poverty reduction and global prosperity have *stalled* during the past five years, impacted by a “polycrisis” which describes a confluence of crises including slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty. This highlights the challenges in achieving sustainable poverty reduction in the face of interconnected global risks.


**1. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for the implementation of all PPP projects across the country.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee exclusively evaluates PPP projects undertaken by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in policy-level matters concerning PPPs, it does not handle the implementation of all PPP projects.  Implementation involves various ministries and agencies at different levels of government.  The statement oversimplifies the complex process of PPP project execution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee specifically assesses PPP projects undertaken by the central government. This committee's role is crucial in evaluating the financial viability, risk mitigation strategies, and overall feasibility of these projects before their approval and implementation.  This ensures a degree of standardization and oversight for central government projects.  The evaluation process aims to minimize potential risks and ensure value for money.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India:**

1. The MSP covers all agricultural crops produced in India, ensuring a guaranteed price for farmers across the board.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any further governmental review or approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP mechanism in India doesn't cover every single agricultural crop produced.  It covers a specific list of 22 crops, categorized into Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops. Many other crops are not included in the MSP system, leaving farmers producing those crops vulnerable to market fluctuations.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of the MSP coverage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs based on their calculations of production costs, the final decision on MSPs rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. This signifies the political and economic considerations that also influence the final MSP values, making the CACP's recommendation only one step in the process. The CCEA's approval ensures wider government input and accountability.


**3. With reference to India’s Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agricultural Export Policy of 2018 set an ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2023.
2.  Agricultural exports in India consistently exceeded the targets set by the 2018 policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, indeed aimed for $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 (not 2023 as stated, but a minor detail). This ambitious target aimed to boost the agricultural sector and increase India's global presence in agricultural trade. The policy outlined various strategies and initiatives to achieve this goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 showed an 8% decline and fell short of the 2018 policy's target. This indicates that the policy's ambitious goals were not met, highlighting the challenges in achieving significant increases in agricultural exports. The statement contradicts the factual data presented.


**4. With reference to the “Middle Income Trap,” consider the following statements:**

1.  The World Bank coined the term "middle-income trap" in 2007 to describe economies that stagnate at middle-income levels and fail to transition to high-income status.
2. India's per capita GDP currently places it firmly outside the World Bank's classification of Middle-Income Countries (MICs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The World Bank's 2007 research and publications are widely recognized as introducing and defining the "middle-income trap" concept. The term highlights the developmental challenge faced by many economies that struggle to overcome certain barriers to reach high-income status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that India's per capita GDP is approximately $2,500. The World Bank's classification of MICs includes economies with per capita GNI between US$ 1,135 and US$ 13,846.  Therefore, India falls squarely within the World Bank's definition of a MIC, making the statement false.


**5.  With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Global MPI report, jointly published by UNDP and OPHI, indicated that India had the second-highest number of people living in extreme multidimensional poverty.
2. The MPI solely focuses on income poverty, ignoring other crucial dimensions of poverty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that India had the largest number of people (234 million) living in extreme multidimensional poverty, not the second-highest.  The statement misrepresents the key finding of the report regarding India's poverty levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MPI explicitly measures multiple deprivations across various dimensions, including education, health, and living standards, not just income poverty. It is a multidimensional index that provides a more comprehensive view of poverty than income-based measures alone.  The statement fundamentally mischaracterizes the nature and scope of the MPI.


**6. With reference to India’s microfinance sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) classifies all collateral-free loans to low-income households as microfinance loans, regardless of the loan amount.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans through Microfinance Institutions (MFIs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RBI's definition of microfinance loans explicitly includes all collateral-free loans given to low-income households (with an annual income up to ₹3,00,000), irrespective of the specific loan amount. This broad definition encompasses various lending institutions and programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMMY aims to support micro and small enterprises, it doesn't restrict its loan distribution to MFIs alone.  It utilizes commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) as well to disburse loans under the scheme. The statement incorrectly limits the disbursement channels of PMMY.


**7. With reference to inheritance tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India currently levies an inheritance tax, similar to the estate duty that was previously abolished.
2. The gift tax in India, reintroduced in 2004, exempts all gifts received from close relatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that there is currently no inheritance tax levied in India.  The earlier estate duty was abolished in 1985 due to its unpopularity, and it has not been reinstated.  The statement contradicts the provided information on India's current tax system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the gift tax does have exemptions, it doesn't exempt *all* gifts from close relatives.  The passage mentions exceptions for donations, inheritance, and gifts from close relatives *under certain conditions* (like gifts during weddings), implying that not all such gifts are fully exempt. The statement overstates the scope of the gift tax exemptions.



**8. With reference to the Preston Curve, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preston Curve demonstrates a consistent linear relationship between per capita income and life expectancy across all levels of development.
2. Samuel H. Preston, an American sociologist, first proposed the Preston Curve in 1975.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preston Curve doesn't show a simple linear relationship.  It highlights that while increases in per capita income initially lead to significant improvements in life expectancy (due to better nutrition, sanitation, and healthcare), this relationship flattens out beyond a certain point.  The statement misrepresents the non-linear nature of the curve.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage accurately attributes the first proposal of the Preston Curve to Samuel H. Preston, an American sociologist, in 1975. His work highlighted the complex relationship between economic development and life expectancy.


**9. With reference to the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1895, alongside the original five Nobel Prizes.
2. Amartya Sen was the first Indian to receive the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, awarded in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (officially the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel) was established later, in 1968, by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank). It's not one of the original five prizes established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895.

Statement 2 is correct. Amartya Sen's 1998 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences is well-documented and widely acknowledged for his significant contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory.  He was indeed the first Indian to receive this prestigious award.


**10. With reference to PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by ISRO, exclusively using its satellite imagery.
2. The plan integrates data from various ministries, including projects related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ISRO's satellite imagery is integrated into the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, the Digital Master Planning tool was developed by BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics), not solely by ISRO.  The statement inaccurately attributes the tool's development.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the PM GatiShakti plan is its integration of data from various ministries, encompassing projects under Bharatmala (roads), Sagarmala (ports), and UDAN (regional air connectivity). This integrated approach aims to improve coordination and efficiency in infrastructure development.


**1. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  Geological Survey of India has identified significant reserves of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts primarily off the coasts of Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  This exclusion highlights the specific focus on non-hydrocarbon mineral resources in the deep sea. The rules are designed to regulate and govern the exploration and extraction of these specific resources, excluding the already established regulatory framework for oil and gas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Geological Survey of India has indeed delineated resources of polymetallic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and crusts, these are found in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not primarily off the coasts of Gujarat and Maharashtra. The coastal regions of Gujarat and Maharashtra are known for different offshore mineral resources, such as lime mud and construction-grade sand.  The geographical location of these specific mineral deposits is crucial for understanding the scope and application of the new rules and the distribution of India's offshore mineral wealth.


**2. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) aim to reduce the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport.
2. The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index is a tool to assess the efficiency of India's logistics sector.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) are explicitly designed to *increase* the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport.  The National Rail Plan 2030 aims to significantly boost this share, and the DFCs are a key component of that strategy.  The creation of dedicated freight corridors aims to improve efficiency and reduce transit times, thereby making rail freight a more competitive option compared to road transport.

Statement 2 is correct. The Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) Index is indeed a tool used to evaluate and rank the performance of different states in India regarding their logistics infrastructure and efficiency.  This index is a crucial instrument for identifying areas needing improvement and promoting best practices across the country.  The LEADS Index helps in understanding the effectiveness of various policy initiatives and infrastructure development in improving the overall logistics environment.


**3. With reference to India's seaweed farming, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is primarily focused on inland water bodies, such as rivers and lakes.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 10 million tons per year by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seaweeds can be found in various aquatic environments, including rivers and lakes, seaweed cultivation in India is primarily focused on marine environments, leveraging the country's extensive coastline.  The unique properties of marine seaweeds and the suitability of coastal areas for large-scale cultivation make marine environments the preferred location for seaweed farms. The cultivation techniques and the types of seaweeds grown are tailored to the specific marine conditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims for a seaweed production target of 1 *million* tons per year by 2025, not 10 million tons.  This ambitious target reflects the government's commitment to promoting seaweed cultivation as a sustainable and economically viable activity.  The target, while significant, is considerably lower than the figure mentioned in the statement. The difference highlights the importance of paying attention to details when assessing government policy targets.


**4. With reference to the Indian steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption significantly exceeds the global average.
2.  The Indian steel industry faces challenges due to high reliance on imported coking coal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's per capita finished steel consumption is considerably *lower* than the global average. This indicates significant potential for growth in the domestic steel market. The lower per capita consumption highlights the need for strategies to increase domestic demand and reduce reliance on exports, particularly in light of global competition and environmental concerns.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian steel industry is indeed significantly reliant on imported coking coal, which is a crucial raw material in steel production. This dependence makes the industry vulnerable to fluctuations in global coal prices and supply chain disruptions. The high cost of imported coal increases production costs and makes Indian steel less competitive in the international market.  Addressing this dependence through domestic coal production or exploring alternative technologies is a critical challenge for the sector.


**5.  With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID was established under the Companies Act, 2013.
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to provide short-term, recourse-based financing for infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Central Government did notify NaBFID as a Public Financial Institution (PFI) under the Companies Act, 2013,  NaBFID itself was established under a separate Act – the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021.  This distinction is important for understanding the legal basis and governance structure of this specialized financial institution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's primary objective is to support the development of *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing in India. The focus on long-term financing and the non-recourse nature of the loans are key features designed to attract private investment and reduce the risk for infrastructure projects.  The emphasis on long-term and non-recourse financing is crucial for fostering sustainable infrastructure development.



**1. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar platform, a key component of India Stack, primarily functions as a data governance layer, ensuring secure data storage and access.
2.  The One Future Alliance, a G20 initiative, focuses on providing financial assistance and technical expertise to high-income countries for DPI implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is part of the Identity layer of India Stack, not the data governance layer.  The data governance layer involves platforms like DigiLocker, which manages digital document storage and access.  Aadhaar provides a unique digital identity for individuals, a crucial building block for other DPI services but not the governance itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The One Future Alliance aims to support Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), not high-income countries, in building their DPI capacity.  The initiative recognizes that many LMICs lack the resources and expertise needed to implement robust DPI systems, and it works to address this gap through capacity building, technical assistance, and appropriate funding.  Focusing on already developed nations would contradict the Alliance's core purpose.


**2.  Consider the following statements regarding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development:**

1.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates all PPP projects, both at the central and state levels, ensuring uniform standards across the country.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) primarily focuses on attracting private investment by leasing out government assets for short-term periods, generating revenue for immediate budgetary needs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects. State-level PPP projects have their own evaluation mechanisms.  The statement oversimplifies the complexities of PPP project appraisal in India, where different levels of government have varying levels of involvement and oversight.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NMP does aim to attract private investment, it targets long-term monetisation of government assets, not just short-term leases.  The goal is to unlock significant capital for infrastructure development over a four-year period (FY22-FY25), aiming for a substantial ₹6.0 lakh crore investment, which requires a longer-term approach than simply leasing assets for short-term revenue.


**3. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMGS NMP utilizes exclusively proprietary technology developed by Indian companies, ensuring data security and preventing foreign interference.
2.  The plan encompasses a comprehensive database of only future infrastructure projects across various ministries, focusing on strategic planning and avoiding redundancy in current projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP is built on open-source technology, not exclusively proprietary technology. This openness allows for greater collaboration and scalability. The use of open-source technology doesn't necessarily compromise data security; appropriate security measures can be implemented regardless of the underlying technology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PMGS NMP includes a database of both ongoing and future infrastructure projects.  This holistic approach is crucial for effective coordination and efficient resource allocation.  Focusing solely on future projects would ignore the need to integrate and optimize existing projects, potentially leading to inefficiencies.


**4. With reference to India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Gau Chip" and "Mahish Chip" initiatives aim to improve livestock productivity by tracking individual animal health and genetic traits, leading to targeted interventions.
2.  India's high antibiotic usage in animals is primarily attributed to the widespread availability of affordable antibiotics, leading to their excessive and often unnecessary use by farmers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Gau Chip" (for cattle) and "Mahish Chip" (for buffalo) are genomic chips developed to monitor individual animal health and genetic characteristics, enabling better disease management, breeding programs and overall productivity improvement.  This precise data allows for targeted interventions, improving efficiency and reducing economic losses.

Statement 2 is partially correct but oversimplified. While the affordability of antibiotics plays a role, the high antibiotic usage in India is a complex issue stemming from factors beyond just cost. These factors include inadequate veterinary services, lack of awareness about responsible antibiotic use, and the pressure to maximize livestock production.  Attributing it solely to affordability is an oversimplification of a multifaceted problem.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Agri-tech sector in India:**

1. The KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geo-INformatics) project primarily utilizes satellite imagery from INSAT series of satellites for crop assessment and yield estimation.
2. The FASAL (Forecasting Agricultural Output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land based Observations) project solely focuses on providing short-term (seasonal) crop yield forecasts, neglecting long-term agricultural planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While KISAN uses space technology, including satellite imagery, for crop assessment, it's not exclusively limited to the INSAT series.  It leverages a variety of remote sensing data sources to improve accuracy and reliability.  The statement wrongly restricts the data sources to a specific satellite series.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FASAL project provides both short-term and long-term forecasts, enabling better agricultural planning and resource management.  It aims to provide timely and accurate information for various stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, and businesses, and the information is crucial for both immediate decision-making and long-term strategies.


**6. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The MPI 2024 report indicates that India has witnessed a significant reduction in the number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty compared to previous years.
2. The MPI measures poverty solely based on income levels, providing a straightforward comparison of economic well-being across different nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, although the exact figures and trends need to be verified with the latest MPI report.  Generally, the MPI reports show a global trend towards poverty reduction, and India's progress in this area has been documented in various reports, though the extent of reduction might vary.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MPI uses a multidimensional approach, considering various factors beyond income levels.  These factors include health, education, and living standards, giving a more comprehensive picture of poverty than income-based measures alone.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the complexity of the MPI's methodology.


**7. With reference to the Preston Curve, consider the following statements:**

1. The Preston Curve demonstrates a consistent linear relationship between per capita income and life expectancy across all levels of economic development.
2.  The flattening of the Preston Curve at higher income levels suggests that further increases in per capita income have diminishing returns on life expectancy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Preston Curve shows a non-linear relationship. While increases in per capita income initially lead to significant improvements in life expectancy, this effect diminishes at higher income levels.  The relationship is not consistently linear across all stages of economic development.

Statement 2 is correct.  The flattening of the curve at higher income levels indicates that while increases in per capita income still have some positive impact on life expectancy, the effect is less pronounced.  Other factors, such as lifestyle choices and access to advanced healthcare, become more significant determinants of life expectancy at higher income levels.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences:**

1. The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was established in Alfred Nobel's will alongside the other five Nobel Prizes.
2. Amartya Sen's Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded for his contributions to the development of game theory and its applications in economics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (officially the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel) was established later, in 1968, by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank), not in Alfred Nobel's original 1895 will.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Amartya Sen was awarded the Nobel Prize for his contributions to welfare economics and social choice theory, not for work in game theory.  His work focused on issues of poverty, inequality, and social justice, significantly influencing the field of development economics.


**9. With reference to the Geographical Indications (GI) Act, 1999, consider the following statements:**

1. The GI Act primarily protects the geographical origin of products, preventing misuse of geographical names for commercial purposes.
2. The GI Act provides individual producers with exclusive rights over the use of a particular geographical indication, strengthening individual branding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GI Act focuses on protecting the geographical origin of goods, preventing others from misrepresenting their products' origin to gain unfair commercial advantage.  It protects collective rights associated with specific geographical areas, not individual producers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GI Act grants collective rights to producers associated with a specific geographical area, not exclusive rights to individual producers.  The protection is for the collective reputation and quality associated with a particular region, rather than individual producers within that region.


**10. With reference to India's Patent Act and related policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2024, introduced a stricter system for granting patents, aiming to reduce the number of patents granted for incremental innovations.
2. The National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy, 2016, primarily focuses on enforcing stricter patent laws to maximize revenue generation through patent licensing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the 2024 amendments did make some changes to patent procedures, they didn't necessarily introduce a stricter system aimed at reducing patents for incremental innovations.  The amendments focused on streamlining processes and reducing the time required for patent examination.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2016 IPR Policy aims to promote innovation and protect intellectual property rights, but its primary focus is not solely on maximizing revenue through strict patent enforcement.  It seeks a balanced approach that supports innovation while ensuring fair and equitable access to technology.  The policy includes provisions promoting awareness, facilitating access to IP protection for startups and SMEs, and promoting international collaboration.


**1. With reference to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. AIF provides short-term debt financing for investments in post-harvest management infrastructure.
2.  The interest subvention offered under AIF is applicable to all loan amounts, irrespective of size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) is designed as a medium-to-long-term debt financing facility, not short-term.  It aims to support investments in infrastructure crucial for post-harvest management, contributing to reduced agricultural losses and improved farmer income.  The focus is on sustainable, long-term improvements to the agricultural value chain.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While AIF does offer interest subvention, it's not universally applicable to all loan amounts.  The interest subvention of 3% per annum is specifically designed for loans up to ₹2 crore. Loans exceeding this amount will not receive the full interest subvention, potentially altering the overall financial attractiveness of the scheme for larger projects.  This targeted approach reflects a strategy to prioritize support for smaller-scale farmers and projects.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan:**

1. The PM GatiShakti Master Plan utilizes a proprietary, closed-source technology platform for its operations.
2.  The plan integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala and Sagarmala projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is deliberately built on an open-source technology platform, enhancing transparency, accessibility, and collaboration among stakeholders.  The use of open-source technology promotes interoperability and avoids vendor lock-in, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability in the future.  This aligns with the government's broader push towards digital public infrastructure.

Statement 2 is correct. A core feature of the PM GatiShakti plan is its integration of data from multiple ministries and agencies.

The integration aims to minimize duplication of effort, optimize resource allocation, and create synergies between different infrastructure initiatives.


**3. With reference to India's livestock sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's average annual cattle productivity surpasses the global average.
2. The 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip' initiatives are focused on improving animal disease surveillance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's average annual cattle productivity lags behind the global average.  The provided data indicates that India's average is significantly lower (1777 kg/animal/year) compared to the global average (2699 kg/animal/year). This productivity gap highlights the need for interventions to improve livestock health, breeding practices, and overall management.

Statement 2 is incorrect, although partially true in its implication. While the 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip' initiatives aim to improve overall livestock management, their primary focus is not solely on disease surveillance.  These genomic chips are designed to provide a comprehensive genetic profile of cattle and buffaloes, respectively. This data can be used for various purposes, including breeding programs to improve productivity, disease resistance, and traceability within the supply chain. Disease surveillance is a beneficial byproduct, but not the central goal.


**4. With reference to the National Technical Textiles Mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's technical textiles market is currently the world's largest.
2. The mission primarily focuses on aesthetic and decorative applications of textiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India possesses a significant technical textiles market, it is not the world's largest. The provided information states that India's technical textiles market is the fifth largest globally, indicating substantial growth potential but not a current leadership position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Technical Textiles Mission explicitly focuses on the *technical performance* and functional properties of textiles, not their aesthetic or decorative aspects.  The applications highlighted (agriculture, roads, railways, sportswear, healthcare, protective gear, aerospace) all emphasize the functional capabilities of these specialized textiles.  The mission aims to leverage India's capabilities in this sector to achieve global competitiveness.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1. The Indian MPI (NMPI) utilizes data from the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) for its calculations.
2. The NMPI includes indicators related to maternal health and access to banking services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI) in India uses data primarily from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC). The NFHS provides comprehensive household-level data on health, education, and living standards, which are crucial for calculating the MPI.  The SECC, while valuable for socio-economic information, does not offer the same level of detail required for MPI calculations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NMPI expands upon the global MPI model by incorporating additional indicators relevant to the Indian context.  These include maternal health and access to banking services, reflecting the importance of these factors in overall well-being and poverty reduction strategies.  The inclusion of these indicators provides a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of multidimensional poverty in India.


**6. With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is classified under sericulture, a branch of agriculture.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Seaweed cultivation falls under aquaculture, not sericulture. Sericulture pertains to the cultivation of silkworms for silk production, a completely different agricultural domain. Aquaculture encompasses the farming of aquatic organisms, including seaweed, in controlled environments.  The distinction is crucial for understanding the different techniques and economic considerations involved.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has a stated ambition to achieve 1 million tons of annual seaweed production by 2025.  This ambitious target reflects the growing recognition of seaweed's economic and environmental significance and the government's commitment to promoting sustainable aquaculture practices.  This initiative aims to boost the blue economy and create employment opportunities.


**7.  With reference to the Indian Textile Sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme offers a credit-linked subsidy for the textile industry's modernization.
2. The Samarth scheme primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to textile entrepreneurs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS) is designed to provide credit-linked subsidies to support modernization and technology upgrades within the Indian textile industry.  This scheme aims to enhance the competitiveness of the sector by encouraging the adoption of advanced technologies and improved manufacturing processes.  This is a key element in the government's strategy to boost the textile sector's global standing.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Samarth scheme's focus is primarily on capacity building and skill development within the textile sector, not financial assistance.  It aims to address the growing need for skilled manpower by providing training and certifications in various textile-related skills.  While financial aspects might be indirectly involved through potential employment opportunities after training, direct financial aid is not the core objective of the Samarth scheme.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI):**

1.  The ICI includes the production of automobiles as one of its eight core industries.
2. The ICI is released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) does *not* include automobiles.  The eight core industries included in the ICI are fertilizers, cement, natural gas, crude oil, coal, electricity, steel, and petroleum refinery products.  These sectors are chosen for their significant contribution to overall industrial production and their interconnectedness within the economy.  The exclusion of automobiles reflects the specific focus on energy and basic materials production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ICI is released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, not the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.  The Office of the Economic Adviser plays a key role in monitoring and analyzing macroeconomic indicators, and the release of the ICI falls under its purview.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has a different, albeit related, mandate concerning national statistics.


**9. With reference to ICAR-NISA, consider the following statements:**

1. ICAR-NISA was initially established as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums in 1947.
2.  It currently operates under the Ministry of Rural Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ICAR-NISA's initial establishment date was 1924, not 1947.  It was founded as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums in Ranchi, Jharkhand.  The correct year is crucial for understanding its historical context and its long-standing role in agricultural research and development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ICAR-NISA comes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This placement reflects its core focus on agricultural research and its contribution to improving agricultural practices and productivity.  The Ministry of Rural Development has a distinct set of responsibilities concerning rural development initiatives.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS):**

1. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS).  They are also regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
2.  District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) play a crucial role in providing funds to PACS, representing a key component of the short-term cooperative credit structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PACS are indeed registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and administered by the RCS, they are *not* regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  This is a crucial distinction.  The RBI primarily regulates commercial banks and other financial institutions under its purview.  PACS operate under a different regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs are a vital link in the cooperative credit system, acting as a source of funds for PACS. This flow of credit is essential for PACS to fulfill their role in providing agricultural credit at the grassroots level. The cooperative structure, with DCCBs supporting PACS, is a key feature of the agricultural credit landscape.  The statement accurately reflects this relationship.


**2. With reference to the ISI Mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI Mark, developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), is mandatory for all products sold in India to ensure quality and safety.
2. The Central Government mandates the ISI mark for specific products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs) under Scheme I (ISI Mark Scheme) of the BIS.  This includes products like electrical appliances, cement, and automobile accessories, but excludes agricultural products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is *not* mandatory for *all* products sold in India. The government selectively mandates it for certain products deemed crucial for safety and quality through the issuance of QCOs.  This targeted approach ensures that the most critical products meet specific standards.  The statement overgeneralizes the scope of the ISI Mark's mandatory application.

Statement 2 is correct. The Central Government's power to mandate the ISI mark for specific products through QCOs is a key aspect of the BIS's regulatory function.  The examples given (electrical appliances, cement, automobile accessories) are accurate. The exclusion of agricultural products is a simplification; certain agricultural products *may* fall under QCOs, but it's not a universal rule.


**3. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports in 2023-24 exceeded the ambitious target of $60 billion set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.  Rice constituted the largest share of these exports.
2. The Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) aims to improve infrastructure related to agricultural exports, including cold chains and land customs stations, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing post-harvest losses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an *8% decline* and fell short of the $60 billion target.  While rice is a significant export, the statement incorrectly presents the overall export performance and overstates the export volume.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of TIES accurately reflects its objectives.  The scheme focuses on improving infrastructure crucial for efficient agricultural exports, addressing critical bottlenecks in the supply chain such as cold storage and border crossing facilities.  The statement correctly identifies the scheme's aims and its contribution to export enhancement.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Monetary Policy Transmission mechanism:**

1. Monetary policy transmission refers solely to the impact of changes in the repo rate on inflation.
2. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy decisions, including changes in policy rates, directly influence economic variables such as the price level and overall economic activity through a process known as monetary policy transmission.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Monetary policy transmission is a much broader concept than simply the repo rate's influence on inflation. While inflation is a key target, the transmission mechanism encompasses the impact of monetary policy decisions on various economic variables, including credit availability, investment, consumption, and exchange rates.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and incomplete view of the process.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately defines monetary policy transmission as the process through which RBI's actions affect the wider economy. It correctly highlights the link between policy rate changes and their ripple effects on economic variables, including the price level and overall economic activity. The statement provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanism.


**5. With reference to Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is a single-value index (0 to 100) that assesses financial inclusion across India, with 0 representing complete exclusion and 100 representing full inclusion. The index is published biennially in January.
2. The FI-Index incorporates details from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors to provide a comprehensive assessment of financial inclusion.  The index includes three broad parameters: Access, Usage, and Quality, each with varying weightages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the FI-Index is indeed a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, with the described interpretations, the publication frequency is incorrect. The text specifies that it's published *annually* in July, not biennially in January.  This inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately describes the scope and parameters of the FI-Index.  The inclusion of diverse sectors (banking, investments, insurance, postal, pension) and the three key parameters (Access, Usage, Quality) are all accurately represented. The statement correctly reflects the comprehensive nature of the index.


**6. With reference to  the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021, consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS, established under the RBI Act, 1934, provides a cost-free mechanism for resolving customer grievances related to services provided by all RBI-regulated entities.
2. The scheme covers commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) irrespective of their asset size, but excludes Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RB-IOS does provide a cost-free redressal mechanism and addresses customer grievances, it is not solely based on the RBI Act, 1934. It draws upon multiple acts including the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  Furthermore, it doesn't cover *all* RBI-regulated entities; it has specific coverage criteria regarding asset sizes for certain entities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The scheme's coverage is not universal for all entities mentioned.  It explicitly mentions size thresholds for inclusion—for example, Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above are included, and NBFCs with assets of ₹100 crore and above are included.  The statement incorrectly implies universal coverage irrespective of size.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the  India International Bullion Exchange (IIBX):**

1. The IIBX, established in 2022 at the GIFT City, is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and aims to provide a transparent and regulated platform for trading in precious metals.
2.  The IIBX is promoted by leading market infrastructure institutions in India and facilitates trading in physical gold and silver of high purity, often kept in the form of bars, ingots, or coins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IIBX is *not* regulated by SEBI.  It is regulated by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), given its location within the GIFT City, which operates under a separate regulatory framework. The statement misidentifies the regulatory body.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately describes the IIBX's purpose, its location, promoters, and the type of trading it facilitates. The description of bullion and its forms is also accurate.  The statement provides a correct and complete summary of the exchange's key features.


**8. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating faster cross-border retail payments by linking their respective Instant Payment Systems (IPS).
2. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub conceptualized Project Nexus, which aims to achieve G20 targets of enabling cheaper, faster, more transparent, and accessible cross-border payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Project Nexus is not a *bilateral* initiative limited to India and Singapore. It's a *multilateral* initiative involving several countries, including India and four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand). The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the project's participation.

Statement 2 is correct. This accurately describes Project Nexus's origins and objectives. The BIS Innovation Hub's role in conceptualization and the alignment with G20 goals for cross-border payments are both correctly stated. The statement accurately represents the project's broader context and aspirations.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding  the  National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP):**

1. Launched in 2018-19, the NFSM-OS&OP primarily focuses on increasing the production of oilseeds through improved irrigation techniques and the use of high-yield crop varieties.
2. The NFSM-OS&OP is a comprehensive program that encompasses seed components (breeding and distribution), production inputs, technology transfer, and market development initiatives to enhance oilseed production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increasing oilseed production is a key goal, the statement oversimplifies the NFSM-OS&OP's approach.  It doesn't solely rely on irrigation and high-yield varieties. The program has a broader scope, including seed development, technology transfer, and other supportive measures.  The statement is too narrow in its description.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately reflects the comprehensive nature of the NFSM-OS&OP.  It correctly highlights the program's multi-faceted approach, encompassing seed improvement, input provision, technology dissemination, and other crucial aspects of enhancing oilseed production.  The statement offers a complete and accurate overview.


**10. With reference to the  Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural crops, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) determines the MSP for all agricultural crops, including those not included in the list of 22 crops announced by the government.
2. The final decision on MSP is taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, based on recommendations from the CACP. The MSP is announced at the beginning of the sowing season.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CACP's recommendations are crucial, but it doesn't determine the MSP for *all* agricultural crops.  The government announces MSP for a specific list of crops (22 crops are mentioned in the text).  The statement incorrectly implies universal CACP-determined MSP for all crops.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately describes the process of MSP determination. The CCEA's role in final decision-making, the CACP's role in providing recommendations, and the timing of the announcement are all correctly presented. The statement offers a complete and accurate summary of the MSP decision-making process.



**1. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs, irrespective of their asset size or customer interface, are subject to the RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognising Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs).
2.  Housing Finance Companies are explicitly excluded from the RBI's regulatory purview concerning deposit acceptance or customer interface for NBFCs with assets of ₹100 crore and above.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI's regulations specifically target Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) – *excluding* Housing Finance Companies – that accept deposits or have a customer interface and possess assets of ₹100 crore or more. The Omnibus Framework applies to these specified NBFCs, not all NBFCs indiscriminately.  The statement incorrectly broadens the scope of the regulation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that Housing Finance Companies are excluded from the set of NBFCs subject to the described regulations. This exclusion is a crucial detail highlighting a distinction within the NBFC sector and the specific regulatory focus. The statement accurately reflects this exclusion.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Ombudsman, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI Ombudsman's tenure is fixed for a period of five years, with a possibility of extension based on performance evaluation.
2. The redressal of complaints falls under the jurisdiction of 24 Offices of the RBI Ombudsman (ORBIOs) and a Centralized Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC), operating independently of each other.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the RBI may appoint one or more officers as Ombudsman and Deputy Ombudsman for a tenure not exceeding *three* years at a time.  The statement incorrectly extends the tenure to five years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions 24 ORBIOs and CRPC handling complaint redressal, it doesn't state they operate entirely independently.  The implication is that they are part of a coordinated system, not separate, autonomous entities. The statement misrepresents the collaborative nature of their operations.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**3. With reference to Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) as recognised by the RBI, consider the following statements:**

1. An SRO must be a for-profit entity registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure financial stability and accountability.
2.  The RBI mandates that at least one-third of the SRO's Board of Directors, excluding the Chairperson, must be independent members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that an SRO must be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  The statement incorrectly designates it as a for-profit entity. This is a significant factual error concerning the legal structure of SROs under RBI recognition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that at least one-third of the members in the Board of Directors, *including* the Chairperson, must be independent. The statement incorrectly excludes the Chairperson from this requirement, altering the stipulated governance structure.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**4. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), focusing solely on providing regulatory compliance support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2. The establishment of a UO for India’s UCB sector was initially proposed by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006, with a refined model recommended in 2009.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type *II* NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which is consistent with NUCFDC's broader functions beyond just regulatory compliance. The statement misclassifies NUCFDC's NBFC type.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the need for a UO was first highlighted by a working group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006, with a model recommended by Shri V.S. Das's group in 2009. The statement incorrectly reverses the roles and timelines of these two working groups.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework will come into effect from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, regardless of tier category, including those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the PCA framework will be effective from April 1, *2025*, not 2024.  This is a crucial detail regarding the implementation timeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the framework applies to UCBs in tiers 2, 3, and 4, *excluding* those under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The statement incorrectly includes UCBs under AID in the framework's application.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**6. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are mandated to resolve acquired financial assets within a maximum period of 5 years from the date of acquisition.
2. The Narasimham Committee I (1991) first proposed the establishment of asset reconstruction companies in India, drawing parallels with similar entities globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that ARCs are required to resolve assets within a maximum of *8* years, not 5 years, after acquisition.  This difference in the timeframe is a significant detail in the regulatory requirements for ARCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that the Narasimham Committee *II* (1998), not Committee I (1991), proposed the establishment of ARCs.  This is a crucial distinction regarding the timeline of policy recommendations. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**7. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI was established in 2002 under the Competition Act, 2009.
2. The CCI's composition includes a Chairperson and 5 members appointed by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCI was established in 2009 under the Competition Act, 2002.  The statement incorrectly reverses the years of establishment and enactment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the CCI comprises a Chairperson and *6* members, not 5, appointed by the Central Government. This numerical discrepancy affects the composition detail.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**8. With reference to the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act primarily focused on nationalizing all coal mines under the control of Coal India Limited (CIL) to enhance production.
2. The Act permitted the auction of coal mines for commercial mining by private entities, thus promoting private sector participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CMSP Act, 2015, did not aim to nationalize coal mines but rather to facilitate their allocation through auctions. The act's purpose was to increase coal production by allowing private companies to participate in coal mining, not to increase CIL's control.

Statement 2 is correct. The act specifically permitted the auction of coal mines to private entities, marking a significant shift in the coal sector's dynamics towards private sector participation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9.  With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty is the second WIPO treaty to address the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK).
2.  The treaty's implementation will commence 6 months after ratification by 15 parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that this is the *first* WIPO treaty to address the interface between IP, GRs, and TK, not the second.  This is a key fact about the treaty's novelty.

**10. With reference to the  Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL), consider the following statements:**

1. TKDL is a physical repository established to safeguard India's traditional knowledge from biopiracy and wrongful patents.
2. TKDL's primary function is to facilitate the commercialization of traditional knowledge by Indian businesses globally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. TKDL is a *digital*, not physical, repository designed to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the repository.

Statement 2 is incorrect. TKDL's main purpose is to protect traditional knowledge, not to facilitate its commercialization. While commercial applications might arise from its use, its core function is preventative and protective, not promotional. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**11. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council is a non-constitutional body established under Article 279B of the Constitution through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016.
2.  Decisions within the GST Council require a two-thirds majority of the weighted votes, with states collectively holding a 50% voting weight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is a *constitutional* body, established under Article 279A, not 279B, of the Constitution.  The statement incorrectly designates its constitutional status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Decisions in the GST Council require a three-fourths (75%), not two-thirds (66.67%), majority of weighted votes.  Further, the states collectively hold a two-thirds (66.67%) voting weight, not 50%. The statement is inaccurate in both the majority requirement and the voting weight distribution. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**12. With reference to the  PRAVAAH portal, consider the following statements:**

1. PRAVAAH is a decentralized, web-based portal designed to streamline the process of obtaining various licenses and regulatory approvals.
2.  PRAVAAH is primarily aimed at facilitating applications for regulatory approvals related to the financial services sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PRAVAAH is described as a *secure and centralized* web-based portal, not decentralized. The statement misrepresents the portal's architecture and design.

Statement 2 is incorrect, although it's partially true in the context of the provided text which mentions its use for obtaining authorizations, licenses, or regulatory approvals.  However, the text doesn't restrict its use *only* to the financial services sector.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of PRAVAAH's applications. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**13. With reference to the RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The new norms mandate that provisions for Bad & Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) should be added to the bank's capital reserves.
2.  Co-operative banks are permitted to allocate net profits to BDDR only after fulfilling all regulatory compliance requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that provisions for BDDR must be charged as an *expense* to the Profit and Loss Account, not added to capital reserves. This is a fundamental difference in accounting treatment.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that after complying with IRACP norms and other regulations, co-operative banks may allocate net profits to BDDR. The statement accurately reflects this sequential requirement. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**14. With reference to Co-lending arrangements as per RBI guidelines, consider the following statements:**

1. Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group, provided certain conditions are met.
2.  In co-lending, a minimum of 30% of the credit risk must be borne by the NBFC partner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly prohibits banks from entering into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. The statement contradicts this explicit prohibition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that a minimum of 20%, not 30%, of the credit risk must be borne by the NBFC partner in co-lending arrangements. The statement incorrectly increases the minimum risk percentage. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.

1.  The time limit for filing a request for examination of a patent application has been increased from 31 months to 48 months.
2. The frequency of filing statements of working of patents has been increased from once every three financial years to once per financial year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the time limit for filing a request for examination has been *reduced* from 48 months to 31 months, not increased. The statement incorrectly describes the change in the time limit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that the frequency of filing statements of working of patents has been *reduced* from once per financial year to once every three financial years, not increased. The statement misrepresents the change in frequency. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**16. With reference to India Stack, consider the following statements:**

1. India Stack is a proprietary digital public infrastructure (DPI) developed by a consortium of private technology companies.
2. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) was launched during the G20 summit in 2022 to promote the adoption of DPI globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India Stack is described as India's *own foundational* DPI, not a proprietary system developed by private companies. The statement incorrectly attributes its development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that GDPIR was announced at the G20 virtual leaders' summit in *2023*, not 2022.  The statement incorrectly specifies the year of the announcement. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**17. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. UPI was launched in 2018 and is an instant real-time payment system.
2. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) was established under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that UPI was launched in *2016*, not 2018. This is a crucial detail concerning the timeline of UPI's introduction.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately states that NPCI was incorporated in 2008 under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**1. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are primarily regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, ensuring adherence to stringent financial norms.
2.  One of the key functions of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) is to provide financial assistance to PACS, thereby strengthening the rural credit structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS). They fall outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and are not directly regulated by the RBI.  The RBI's regulatory oversight primarily extends to DCCBs and Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) which are involved in refinancing PACS. This difference in regulatory frameworks is a crucial aspect of understanding the cooperative credit structure in India. The statement attempts to mislead by wrongly attributing RBI regulation to PACS.


Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs play a vital role in the rural credit system by providing funds to PACS. This refinancing mechanism is essential for PACS to function effectively and provide credit to farmers.  The functioning of DCCBs as a source of funds for PACS is a key element of the cooperative credit structure, showcasing the interconnectedness of these institutions in supporting agricultural activities. The statement accurately reflects this significant function of DCCBs within the cooperative credit system.


**2. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC, registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), primarily focuses on providing direct lending services to individual customers.
2.  The establishment of NUCFDC was primarily driven by the recommendations of the RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006, which advocated for an umbrella organization for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  A Type II NBFC-ND is characterized by its acceptance of public funds and direct interaction with customers.  However, NUCFDC's primary role is not direct lending but rather to act as an umbrella organization supporting UCBs. The statement incorrectly classifies NUCFDC as a Type I NBFC and misrepresents its core function. The categorization of NBFCs and their functions is a critical aspect for understanding the regulatory landscape of the financial sector.


Statement 2 is correct.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was initially highlighted by the RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006. Subsequently, a model for such an organization was recommended by a working group led by Shri V.S. Das in 2009.  This historical context underscores the strategic importance of NUCFDC in strengthening the regulatory framework and operational efficiency of UCBs.  The statement accurately reflects the genesis and rationale behind the establishment of NUCFDC.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The PCA framework, effective from April 1, 2024, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs irrespective of their tier categorization.
2.  The key parameters for monitoring under the PCA framework include the capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs, aiming to enhance the precision and flexibility of regulatory intervention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PCA framework aims to replace the SAF, its effective date is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  Furthermore, the application of the PCA framework excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID). The statement contains inaccuracies regarding both the implementation date and the scope of application of the PCA framework.  Understanding the timeline and exceptions within the regulatory framework is essential for assessing the effectiveness of such measures.


Statement 2 is correct. The new PCA framework focuses on capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability as key monitoring parameters. This targeted approach enhances the precision and flexibility of regulatory interventions, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of UCBs' financial health. The statement correctly identifies the core elements of the PCA framework and its objectives.  The focus on these key parameters reflects a shift towards a more data-driven and risk-based approach to supervision.


**4. With reference to the initiatives taken to strengthen Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, empowers the RBI to supersede the boards of cooperative banks only in cases of severe financial irregularities, but it does not provide the RBI with the power to wind up these banks.
2. UCBs are mandated to achieve a priority sector lending target of 75% by March 2026, and they are permitted to provide loans for agricultural purposes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020, significantly expanded the RBI's powers over cooperative banks.  It allows the RBI to supersede boards and also includes the power to initiate the process of winding up cooperative banks under specific circumstances. The statement incorrectly limits the RBI's powers under the Act. Understanding the full extent of the RBI's regulatory authority is crucial for comprehending the changes in the governance of cooperative banks.


Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are indeed mandated to meet a priority sector lending target of 75% by March 2026, and they are permitted to extend credit for agricultural purposes, expanding their reach into rural lending. This reflects a broader policy objective of promoting financial inclusion and supporting agricultural activities. The statement accurately reflects the regulatory requirements and operational scope of UCBs within the financial sector.


**5. With reference to the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCDC primarily provides loans and grants to individual farmers for enhancing their agricultural productivity and income generation.
2.  The NCDC's operational activities are primarily focused on providing financial assistance to State Governments for financing primary and secondary level cooperative societies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCDC does not directly provide loans and grants to individual farmers. Its primary focus is on supporting the cooperative sector at the state level. The statement incorrectly attributes direct lending functions to the NCDC that it does not perform.  Understanding the different levels of intervention in rural development is crucial for effective policy analysis.


Statement 2 is correct. The NCDC plays a crucial role in strengthening the cooperative movement by providing financial assistance to State Governments for financing primary and secondary level cooperative societies. This indirect approach helps to build a robust cooperative infrastructure at the grassroots level. The statement accurately portrays the NCDC's function in supporting the cooperative sector.  This indirect support mechanism is a significant aspect of the NCDC's strategy for rural development.


**6. Consider the following statements about the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS):**

1. The NAFIS survey, conducted biennially, provides a comprehensive overview of the financial inclusion status of the urban population, focusing on access to credit, insurance, and pension schemes.
2.  The NAFINDEX, a key indicator derived from NAFIS data, measures the overall level of financial inclusion in rural areas by assessing various financial services' penetration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAFIS focuses on the rural population, not the urban population.  The survey's scope is explicitly limited to rural areas, providing insights into the financial inclusion status of rural households. The statement incorrectly attributes the survey's scope to urban areas.  Understanding the geographic focus of the survey is critical for interpreting its findings accurately.


Statement 2 is correct. The NAFINDEX is indeed derived from NAFIS data and serves as a key indicator for measuring the level of financial inclusion in rural areas. It assesses the penetration of various financial services, offering a comprehensive picture of financial access in rural communities. The statement correctly explains the purpose and functionality of the NAFINDEX.  The use of such indices is important for monitoring progress towards financial inclusion goals.


**7. With reference to the Jute Corporation of India (JCI), consider the following statements:**

1. Established in 1972, the JCI primarily functions as a price support agency for jute, implementing the Jute I-CARE project to mechanize jute farming and improve retting techniques.
2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging material for all commodities, regardless of their nature or origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The JCI was established in 1971 (not 1972), and its primary function is indeed price support for jute.  The Jute I-CARE project is also a genuine initiative aimed at improving jute cultivation and retting methods.  The minor inaccuracy in the establishment year does not significantly alter the core accuracy of the statement.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, does not mandate the use of jute packaging for all commodities.  There are specific commodities and exceptions defined under the Act. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the Act's scope.  Understanding the limitations and specific provisions of the Act is crucial for a complete picture.


**8. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1. NBFCs are permitted to accept demand deposits from the public, thereby functioning as a crucial part of the payment and settlement system.
2.  The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) provides deposit insurance coverage for depositors of NBFCs, offering protection up to a maximum amount of ₹5 lakh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NBFCs are explicitly prohibited from accepting demand deposits.  This is a fundamental distinction between banks and NBFCs.  The statement fundamentally misrepresents a core characteristic of NBFCs.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for differentiating between various financial institutions.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The DICGC deposit insurance facility does *not* cover NBFCs.  This protection is limited to commercial banks, local area banks, and regional rural banks. The statement incorrectly attributes DICGC coverage to NBFCs.  Understanding the limitations of deposit insurance is vital for assessing the risk associated with different financial institutions.


**9.  With reference to the Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SBR framework categorizes NBFCs into three layers based on their size, activity, and perceived risk profile, applying differential regulatory requirements to each layer.
2.  The primary objective of the SBR framework is to enhance the regulatory oversight of smaller NBFCs while minimizing the burden on larger, well-established institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SBR framework for NBFCs uses four layers (tiers), not three, for categorization based on size, activity, and risk. The statement contains an inaccurate number of layers in the SBR framework.  Precise understanding of the number of layers and their respective criteria is essential for a correct interpretation of the regulatory structure.


Statement 2 is correct. The SBR framework aims to tailor regulatory requirements to the size and risk profile of NBFCs.  It intends to enhance oversight of smaller, potentially riskier NBFCs while streamlining regulations for larger, more established institutions. The statement correctly identifies the core objective of the SBR framework.  This risk-based approach is a key element in maintaining stability within the financial sector.


**10. With reference to the Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Omnibus Framework mandates that all SROs must be established as for-profit companies registered under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure their financial sustainability.
2. An SRO, under the Omnibus Framework, is required to have a Board of Directors with at least one-third of its members, including the Chairperson, being independent to ensure robust governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Omnibus Framework specifies that SROs should be set up as *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 (not Section 25) of the Companies Act, 2013.  The statement incorrectly specifies the type of company and the relevant section of the Companies Act.  Understanding the legal structure of SROs is crucial for analyzing their role in the regulatory framework.


Statement 2 is correct. The Omnibus Framework mandates that at least one-third of the members of an SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent. This requirement is designed to enhance the objectivity and impartiality of the SRO's governance.  The statement correctly reflects a key aspect of the governance structure required by the Omnibus Framework.  The emphasis on independent directors is a common best practice in corporate governance.


**11. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EIF is a bilateral partnership, primarily supported by Finland, focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to leverage trade for sustainable development.
2.  The EIF Trust Fund Manager is the World Bank, leveraging its expertise in international development and financial management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The EIF is a multilateral (not bilateral), partnership involving 51 countries and international organizations.  Finland is a significant supporter, but it is not the sole supporter of the EIF. The slight inaccuracy regarding the nature of the partnership does not negate the overall accuracy of the statement.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the World Bank.  The statement incorrectly identifies the EIF Trust Fund Manager.  This inaccuracy highlights the importance of knowing the precise organizational structures involved in international development initiatives.


**12. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1.  Established under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the DBN replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas.
2.  The DBN is funded through a Universal Access Levy, which is a fixed percentage of the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN was established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, not the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  The statement incorrectly identifies the legislation under which the DBN was established.  Understanding the legal framework governing the DBN is essential for comprehending its operational parameters.


Statement 2 is correct. The DBN is indeed funded by a Universal Access Levy, which is a percentage (5%) of the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecom licensees.  The statement accurately describes the funding mechanism for the DBN.  This funding mechanism is a key aspect of the DBN's operational structure.


**13. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 2002 under the Competition Act, 2009, the CCI's primary function is to promote and sustain competition in the Indian markets.
2. The CCI is composed of a Chairperson and five members appointed by the Central Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCI was established in 2009 under the Competition Act, 2002, not the other way around. The statement incorrectly interchanges the year of establishment and the year of the Act.  Understanding the chronology of events is crucial for accurate factual recall.


Statement 2 is largely correct.  The CCI is composed of a Chairperson and six (not five) members appointed by the Central Government.  The minor inaccuracy in the number of members does not significantly affect the overall accuracy of the statement.  The composition of the CCI is a crucial aspect of its structure and functioning.


**14. With reference to the challenges in India's coal sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's high dependence on coal imports is primarily due to the abundance of high gross calorific value (GCV) coal within the country, which meets the demands of various industries.
2.  Coal India Limited (CIL) contributes over 90% of the country's indigenous coal production and supply, holding a near-monopoly in the sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's high import dependence on coal is due to a *shortage*, not an abundance, of high-GCV coal.  Domestically produced coal often has higher ash and sulphur content, making it less desirable for certain industries.  The statement presents a completely opposite picture of the reality.  Understanding the quality and characteristics of domestic coal is key to grasping this challenge.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While CIL is a dominant player, its contribution to India's indigenous coal production is around 80%, not 90%. The statement overestimates CIL's market share.  Knowing the precise market share of different players is important for understanding the dynamics of the coal sector.


**15.  Consider the following statements regarding initiatives taken to enhance coal production in India:**

1. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, facilitated the auction of coal mines exclusively for public sector companies, strengthening the role of the state in coal production.
2. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, introduced the Composite Prospecting Licence-cum-Mining Lease (PL-cum-ML) system, allowing for streamlined coal mining operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, permitted the auction of coal mines to *private* entities as well, promoting private sector participation in coal mining.  The statement misrepresents a crucial aspect of the Act's objectives.  Understanding the role of private sector participation is essential for analyzing the reforms in the coal sector.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021, did indeed introduce the Composite PL-cum-ML system for coal, streamlining the process of obtaining licenses for prospecting and mining.  The statement accurately reflects a key provision of the amendment.  The streamlining of licensing procedures is a significant aspect of the reforms aimed at improving the efficiency of the coal sector.



**1. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs, irrespective of their asset size, are mandated to accept deposits or have customer interface.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies,  Merchant Bankers, and Chit Fund Companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text specifies that only certain NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above, and those authorized to accept deposits or having customer interface, fall under a specific regulatory category.  Not all NBFCs meet this criteria.  The statement incorrectly generalizes the requirement for deposit acceptance or customer interface to all NBFCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating NBFCs, the text explicitly mentions that different regulatory bodies oversee specific NBFC types.  Housing Finance Companies are regulated by the National Housing Bank, Merchant Bankers and Venture Capital Funds by SEBI, Insurance companies by IRDAI, Chit Fund Companies by State Governments, and Nidhi Companies by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The RBI's regulatory purview is not all-encompassing for NBFCs.  The statement oversimplifies the complex regulatory landscape of NBFCs in India.


**2. With reference to the Omnibus Framework for recognising Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure financial viability and independence.
2.  The governance framework of an SRO mandates that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, excluding the Chairperson, must be independent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The framework explicitly states that an SRO should be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  This is crucial for its objective of promoting the interests of the sector rather than profit maximization.  The statement incorrectly characterizes the profit-making nature of the SRO.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clarifies that at least one-third of the members in the Board of Directors, *including* the Chairperson, should be independent.  The statement omits the crucial inclusion of the Chairperson in the independent director requirement, altering the essential composition of the SRO's governing body.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):**

1.  The PCA framework will replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) from April 1, 2024, and will apply to all UCBs regardless of their tier classification.
2.  The framework primarily focuses on capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability as key monitoring parameters for UCBs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date mentioned in the text is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  Furthermore, the framework's application excludes UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID).  The statement is inaccurate regarding both the implementation date and the scope of application.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that capital, asset quality, and profitability are the key areas for monitoring under the new PCA framework for UCBs.  This reflects the core focus on the financial health of these institutions.


**4. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ARCs are primarily responsible for acquiring Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions and are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).
2.  The establishment of ARCs was initially proposed by the Narasimham Committee I in 1991, aiming to resolve the issue of stressed assets in the Indian banking sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ARCs are indeed responsible for acquiring NPAs, but they are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  The statement incorrectly identifies the regulatory body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Narasimham Committee II (1998), not Committee I, proposed the establishment of ARCs. The statement is inaccurate concerning the committee and the year of the proposal.


**5. With reference to the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP), consider the following statements:**

1.  PPIRP is applicable to all corporate entities facing financial distress, regardless of the amount of default.
2.  The PPIRP process, introduced as an amendment to the IBC in 2020, is entirely formal throughout its duration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that PPIRP is available for corporate MSMEs with defaults of at least ₹10 lakh.  The statement incorrectly broadens the applicability of PPIRP to all corporate entities and ignores the minimum default threshold.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes PPIRP as a hybrid process with a largely informal pre-initiation phase and a formal post-initiation stage. The statement incorrectly portrays the entire process as formal.  The distinction between the informal and formal stages is a key feature of PPIRP.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), primarily focused on providing credit facilities to urban cooperative banks.
2.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first identified by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which is consistent with NUCFDC's functions.  The statement misclassifies NUCFDC's NBFC type.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text indicates that the need for a UO for India's UCB sector was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006, with a model recommended in 2009 by a working group led by Shri V.S. Das.  The statement incorrectly attributes the initial identification of the need to the wrong person and year.


**7. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IBC mandates that the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) must be completed within 90 days, with a maximum extension of 180 days.
2.  Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) serve as adjudicating authorities for both corporate and individual insolvency and bankruptcy cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC mandates completion of CIRP within 180 days, extendable to a maximum of 330 days, not 90 days with a 180-day extension as stated.  The statement significantly underestimates the allowed timeline for CIRP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While DRTs handle individual or partnership insolvency and bankruptcy, NCLTs are the adjudicating authorities for corporate insolvency cases. The statement incorrectly attributes the jurisdiction of corporate insolvency cases to DRTs.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding Wilful Defaulters:**

1.  A wilful default occurs only when a borrower has the capacity to pay but refuses to do so, without any other accompanying factors.
2.  Lenders are required to establish an Identification Committee to examine evidence of wilful default only when the outstanding amount exceeds ₹50 lakh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A wilful default involves not only the capacity to pay but also other factors such as diversion of funds, disposal of assets, or failure to infuse equity. The statement incorrectly simplifies the definition of wilful default by omitting other crucial elements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifies that the outstanding amount for a wilful default must be ₹25 lakh and above, not ₹50 lakh as stated. The statement incorrectly sets a higher threshold for the establishment of an Identification Committee.


**9. With reference to the Microfinance sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI introduced harmonized regulations for all regulated entities (REs) engaged in microfinance in 2023.
2.  The SHG-Bank Linkage Program, initiated by NABARD in 1992, provides financial services primarily to wealthy households.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions that harmonized regulations for all REs in microfinance were introduced in 2022.  The statement is correct, though the year is slightly off.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SHG-Bank Linkage Program explicitly targets unreached and underserved *poor* households, not wealthy ones.  The statement incorrectly characterizes the target beneficiaries of the program.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text lists seven engines, not eight, driving the PM GatiShakti initiative. The addition of "Energy Infrastructure" is not supported by the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India's cloud). The statement incorrectly describes the technology platform as proprietary and closed-source.


**11.  With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, targeting ₹5.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25).
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP's target is ₹6.0 lakh crore, not ₹5.0 lakh crore, over the specified period.  The statement underestimates the financial target of the NMP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central* sector PPP projects, not just state-level ones.  The statement incorrectly restricts the committee's purview to state-level projects.


**12. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA includes the Principal Purpose Test (PPT) to prevent the abuse of the treaty for tax evasion and avoidance.
2.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism exclusively used to resolve disputes arising from economic double taxation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the amendment to the India-Mauritius DTAA incorporated the PPT to curb treaty abuse for tax evasion and avoidance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions that MAP resolves double taxation disputes whether juridical *or* economic in nature. The statement incorrectly limits MAP's applicability to only economic double taxation disputes.


**1. With reference to the impact of colonization on economic systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  In densely populated colonies, colonial powers often implemented extractive economic policies that prioritized resource extraction over long-term investment and development, leading to widespread impoverishment.
2.  In sparsely populated colonies, where European settlement was more feasible, colonial powers frequently established inclusive institutions designed to encourage European settlement, investment, and long-term economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Colonial economic policies varied significantly depending on the context of the colony.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the reality of many densely populated colonies in Asia and Africa.  These colonies were often subjected to exploitative systems where resources were extracted for the benefit of the colonizing power, with little regard for the long-term economic well-being of the local population. This led to a lack of investment in infrastructure, education, and other crucial sectors, hindering economic development and perpetuating poverty.  The focus was on maximizing short-term gains for the colonizer, often through forced labor, taxation, and control of trade.

Statement 2 is also correct.  In colonies with fewer inhabitants, particularly those suitable for European settlement (like parts of North America, Australia, and New Zealand), colonial powers often adopted a different approach.  They established institutions that aimed to attract European settlers and foster economic growth within the colony. This often included creating property rights, establishing legal systems that protected investment, and encouraging the development of markets and infrastructure.  These policies aimed to create a self-sustaining economy that would benefit both the colonists and the colonizing power in the long run.  However, it's crucial to note that even in these cases, the benefits were primarily for the European settlers, often at the expense of the indigenous populations.


**2. With reference to the Indian agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The contribution of the crop sub-sector to the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the agriculture and allied sector has consistently increased from 2011-12 to 2022-23, reflecting a growth in agricultural productivity and diversification.
2.  Mechanization of agricultural activities in India is significantly higher than in countries like China and Brazil, indicating advanced agricultural technology adoption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that the crop sub-sector's contribution to the GVA of the agriculture and allied sector *declined* from 62.4% to 54.3% between 2011-12 and 2022-23. This indicates a shift in the relative importance of different sub-sectors within the agricultural economy, with forestry and livestock and fishing showing steady increases.  The decline in the crop sub-sector's share might be attributed to various factors, including weather patterns, changing cropping patterns, and market dynamics.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text explicitly states that only 47% of agricultural activities in India are mechanized, a figure lower than both China (60%) and Brazil (75%). This highlights a significant gap in agricultural mechanization in India compared to other major agricultural economies.  This lower level of mechanization can contribute to lower productivity and higher labor costs in the Indian agricultural sector.


**3. With reference to India's logistics sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 15,000 km of National Highways in two phases, significantly improving connectivity and reducing logistics costs.
2.  The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), managed by DFCCIL, aim to increase the share of rail freight traffic from its current level to 45% by 2030, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing reliance on road transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatmala Pariyojana's scope is far more extensive than stated.  The project plans to construct approximately *65,000 km* of National Highways in two phases, not 15,000 km. This larger scale reflects the government's ambition to significantly upgrade India's national highway network and improve connectivity across the country. This correction is crucial as it reflects a much larger-scale infrastructure development plan.

Statement 2 is correct. The Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), under the management of Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL), are indeed aimed at increasing the share of rail freight traffic in India. The goal is to raise this share from 27% (in 2019) to 45% by 2030. This would significantly enhance the efficiency of freight transport, reduce logistics costs, and decrease congestion on the road network.  This is a key component of India's efforts to modernize its logistics infrastructure.


**4. With reference to India's steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's per capita finished steel consumption significantly exceeds the global average, indicating a high level of industrial development and infrastructure growth.
2.  The steel sector in India faces challenges related to raw material sourcing, particularly coking coal, which is largely imported at high costs from Australia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text indicates that India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 was 97.7 kg, which is *significantly lower* than the world average of 219.3 kg and considerably less than China's consumption of 628.3 kg. This lower consumption highlights a potential for growth in the Indian steel sector as the country's economy continues to develop and infrastructure projects expand.  The discrepancy between India's consumption and the global average points to a considerable gap in demand.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian steel industry relies heavily on imported coking coal, primarily from Australia, due to insufficient domestic production. This dependence on imports makes the sector vulnerable to fluctuations in global coal prices and supply chains, increasing production costs. This is a major challenge for the Indian steel industry's competitiveness in the global market and its sustainability.


**5. With reference to India's agricultural exports, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports have consistently increased year-on-year, exceeding the ambitious target set by the India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.
2.  Rice is the largest agricultural export commodity for India, accounting for more than 30% of the total value of agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that agricultural exports in India registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy. This decline highlights the challenges faced by the sector in achieving its export potential.  Factors such as global market conditions, competition, and domestic supply issues could contribute to this shortfall.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While rice is a significant agricultural export for India, the passage indicates it constitutes only 21% of total exports, not more than 30%.  Marine products (15%) and spices (9%) are also major export commodities, highlighting the diversity of India's agricultural export basket.  The lower percentage for rice compared to the statement indicates a need for a more precise understanding of India's export composition.


**6. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all agricultural commodities, without any government oversight or final approval.
2. The MSP currently covers more than 30 agricultural commodities, encompassing a wide range of crops and ensuring price stability for farmers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  The CACP's role is crucial in providing informed recommendations based on cost analysis and market conditions, but the government retains the final authority in setting the MSPs.  This highlights the political and economic considerations that influence MSP determination.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The passage specifies that the MSP currently covers 22 crops, not more than 30.  These 22 crops include 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops, along with Toria and de-husked coconut. The precise number of commodities covered is important in understanding the scope and impact of the MSP system.


**7. With reference to India's edible oil production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India has achieved self-sufficiency in edible oil production, eliminating the need for significant imports of vegetable oils.
2.  A significant portion of oilseed cultivation in India is rain-fed, making production vulnerable to variations in monsoon rainfall.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India is not self-sufficient in edible oil production; a substantial portion of its edible oil needs are met through imports. The text highlights that vegetable oil constitutes 45% of India's edible oil imports, indicating a significant reliance on foreign sources.  The pursuit of self-sufficiency in edible oil production is a major policy objective, but it has not yet been achieved.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage indicates that approximately 72% of oilseed cultivation in India is rain-fed. This makes the production highly susceptible to the vagaries of the monsoon, leading to fluctuations in yields and impacting domestic supply and prices.  This vulnerability underscores the need for improved irrigation infrastructure and drought-resistant varieties to enhance the stability of edible oil production.


**8. With reference to millet production in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the world's largest producer of millets, accounting for over 50% of global production.
2.  The stagnation in millet production is primarily attributed to the high cost of production and lack of government support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a major producer of millets, accounting for nearly 80% of Asia's and 20% of global production, it is not the world's largest producer.  The passage highlights India's significant share but does not claim it to be the largest global producer.  This distinction is important in understanding India's position in the global millet market.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the high cost of production and lack of adequate government support contribute to the stagnation, the passage identifies other factors as well. These include yield gaps due to labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer, a shift in consumer preferences towards fine cereals, and the relatively shorter shelf life of millets, posing storage challenges.  The multifaceted nature of the problem requires a more comprehensive approach to address the issue.


**9. With reference to the National Industrial Corridor Development Programme (NICDP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NICDP aims to develop a total of 5 industrial corridors, comprising 15 industrial projects to be developed across 3 phases.
2. The National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) and the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (NICDC) are involved in the implementation of the NICDP.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NICDP envisions the development of 11 industrial corridors, encompassing 32 projects across four phases, not 5 corridors and 15 projects across 3 phases as stated. This larger scope reflects the ambitious goal of creating world-class manufacturing hubs across India.  The discrepancy highlights the importance of understanding the actual scale of the program.

Statement 2 is correct. The NICDIT and NICDC are indeed the key implementing agencies for the NICDP.  The NICDIT provides strategic guidance and policy direction, while the NICDC is responsible for the project implementation and development on the ground.  This division of roles ensures effective coordination and execution of the program.


**10. With reference to seaweed farming in India, consider the following statements:**

2. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, enabling countries to produce patented products or processes without the consent of the patent holder under specific circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement provides a broad framework for the protection of various forms of intellectual property rights (IPR), including copyrights, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs, patents, and layout-designs of integrated circuits.  The wide range of IPRs covered is crucial to understanding the agreement's scope and impact on global trade and innovation.

Statement 2 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement does indeed allow for compulsory licensing.  This provision enables member countries to license the production of patented products or processes without the patent holder's consent, particularly in situations where public health or national security is at stake.  This flexibility is critical for developing countries to access essential medicines and technologies.  The existence of this clause is important in understanding the balance between IPR protection and public interest.


**12. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Since the economic liberalization in India, the GFCF as a percentage of GDP has consistently remained above 25%, indicating robust and sustained investment in the economy.
2.  In the period following 2011-12, private investment, as a component of GFCF, experienced a significant decline before showing signs of recovery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that while GFCF rose to around 27% of GDP in 2007-08, it subsequently declined, hitting a low of 19.6% in 2020-21 before showing signs of recovery.  The fluctuation in GFCF as a percentage of GDP highlights the volatility of investment in the Indian economy and the challenges in sustaining high levels of investment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage clearly describes the decline in private investment (a major component of GFCF) after 2011-12, followed by a subsequent increase. This decline and subsequent recovery are important aspects of understanding the dynamics of investment in the Indian economy and the factors that influence it.  The description of the trend is crucial in understanding economic performance.


**1. With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's fishing and aquaculture sector contributes approximately 2.5% to the nation's GDP, and seaweed cultivation is a significant component of aquaculture.
2.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve an annual seaweed production target of 2 million tonnes by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5%, not 2.5%, to India's GDP.  While seaweed cultivation is part of aquaculture, the statement overestimates the sector's contribution to the GDP.  This is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions – presenting a slightly altered, yet plausible, statistic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana's target is 1 million tonnes of seaweed production per year by 2025, not 2 million tonnes.  This demonstrates another common distractor strategy: a near-correct figure designed to confuse candidates who may remember the scheme but not the exact production target.  The difference, while seemingly small, is significant in the context of a precise factual recall question. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific numerical data related to government schemes.


**2. With reference to India's Silk Production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the world's largest silk producer, accounting for over 50% of global production in 2023.
2.  Andhra Pradesh is the leading state in India's silk production, contributing more than 40% of the national total.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India is the *second* largest silk producer globally, with 42% of global production in 2023, not the largest with over 50%.  This exemplifies a common error type in UPSC exams – misremembering rankings and percentages.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall precise data and avoid common misconceptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Karnataka, not Andhra Pradesh, is the leading state in India's silk production, contributing around 32% of the total.  This highlights the importance of detailed factual knowledge in answering such questions.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related states and their contributions to the national silk production.  The incorrect option presents a plausible alternative to the correct answer, increasing the difficulty level.


**3. With reference to India's Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) was incorporated in 2008 under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.
2.  The National Rail Plan 2030 aims to increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% in 2019 to 55% by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006, not 2008, under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The slight alteration in the year is a typical UPSC-style distractor aimed at testing precise knowledge.  Candidates need to recall the exact year of incorporation to answer correctly. This tests the candidate's attention to detail and ability to differentiate between similar years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Rail Plan 2030 targets a 45% share of rail freight traffic by 2030, not 55%. This exemplifies another instance of a near-correct but ultimately inaccurate figure intended to mislead. The question assesses the candidates' ability to recall precise numerical targets within the National Rail Plan. The incorrect option demonstrates the use of a plausible but false statistic as a distractor.


**4. With reference to Offshore Minerals in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) contains significant recoverable reserves of gold, diamonds, and rare earth elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the specific exclusions mentioned within the rules.  The incorrect option presents a misleading generalization about the applicability of the rules.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that India's EEZ holds significant recoverable offshore mineral resources, including gold, diamonds, and rare earth elements.  This tests direct factual recall of the minerals present in India's EEZ.  The question assesses the candidate's comprehension of the resources present in India's EEZ.


**5. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across four key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, education, and economic activity.
2.  In the 2022 HDR, India's rank in the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) improved significantly compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII measures gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and labour market participation; not four. The addition of an extra dimension is a subtle but crucial alteration designed to test precise knowledge of the index's components.  The question assesses the candidate's detailed understanding of the GII's constituent factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that India's rank in the IHDI *declined* by six places to 140th in 2022.  The presentation of an opposite trend is a typical UPSC-style distractor. The question tests the candidate's capacity to recall and accurately interpret the direction of changes in India's ranking in the IHDI.  The incorrect option uses a contradictory trend to create confusion.


**6. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 Global MPI report indicates that over 1.2 billion people live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI) includes indicators on maternal health and bank accounts, in addition to the original global MPI indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 Global MPI report states that 1.1 billion people, not 1.2 billion, live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries. This is a classic example of a numerical distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of data from the report. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall precise figures from the MPI report.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that India's NMPI includes maternal health and bank account indicators in addition to the original global MPI indicators. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific additions made to the NMPI compared to the global MPI. The question assesses the candidate's awareness of the modifications made to the global MPI for India's context.


**7. With reference to India's Oilseed Production, consider the following statements:**

1.  More than 75% of oilseed cultivation in India is rainfed.
2.  The National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) aims to increase oil palm cultivation by 7 lakh hectares by 2025-26.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that nearly 72% of oilseed cultivation is rainfed, not more than 75%. This small difference in percentage is a common distractor. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall precise percentages related to agricultural practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMEO-OP aims to expand oil palm cultivation from 3.70 to 10.00 lakh hectares by 2025-26, representing an increase of 6.3 lakh hectares, not 7 lakh hectares.  This slight alteration in the target increase is a typical distractor in UPSC-style questions.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall the precise numerical targets of government schemes.


**8. With reference to Millet Production in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India accounts for approximately 70% of Asia's and 15% of global millet production.
2.  The stagnation in millet production is primarily attributed to a lack of government support and inadequate infrastructure for storage and processing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India accounts for nearly 80% of Asia's and 20% of global millet production, not 70% and 15% respectively. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall precise percentages related to millet production. The incorrect option provides plausible but inaccurate figures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While inadequate storage and processing infrastructure contribute to the stagnation, the text also points to other factors such as yield gaps due to labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer, a shift in consumer preferences, and the impact of MSP-backed procurement schemes for fine cereals.  The question tests the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting millet production, going beyond simplistic explanations.  The incorrect option oversimplifies the complex reasons for the stagnation.


**9.  With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMSY includes the development of Integrated Aquaparks employing advanced technologies like Recirculatory Aquaculture Systems (RAS) and Biofloc.
2.  Under PMMSY, the establishment of five Integrated Aqua parks is planned in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the development of Integrated Aquaparks and the adoption of advanced technologies such as RAS and Biofloc under PMMSY. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific components of the scheme. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the technological aspects of PMMSY.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions the development of five Integrated Aqua parks in Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, and Nagaland; not in the southern states mentioned in the statement. This is a geographical distractor designed to test precise knowledge of the scheme's implementation locations. The question tests the candidate's geographical awareness related to the scheme's implementation.  The incorrect option uses plausible but incorrect locations.


**10. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  India currently has similar logistics agreements with the US, Japan, Australia, France, and Germany.
2.  RELOS allows for the reciprocal exchange of logistics and support facilities, including fuel, rations, spare parts, and berthing for troops, warships, and aircraft, during both wartime and peacetime operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text mentions that India has similar agreements with the US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea; not Germany. This type of question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the countries involved in these agreements.  The incorrect option includes a plausible but incorrect country.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the scope of RELOS, encompassing the reciprocal exchange of logistics and support facilities, including fuel, rations, spare parts, and berthing facilities, during both wartime and peacetime missions. This tests the candidate's comprehension of the agreement's provisions.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the functional scope of RELOS.


**1. With reference to deep-sea mining, consider the following statements:**

1. Polymetallic nodules, primarily composed of manganese and iron, are potato-shaped mineral deposits found on the seabed.
2. Seafloor massive sulphides, located near hydrothermal vents, are rich in copper, gold, and silver, but lack zinc deposits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Polymetallic nodules are indeed small, potato-shaped lumps of minerals found on the seabed, containing high concentrations of manganese and iron, along with other valuable metals.  This is a well-established fact in oceanography and resource exploration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While seafloor massive sulphides are formed around hydrothermal vents and are rich in copper, gold, and silver, they also contain significant deposits of zinc.  The omission of zinc from the description is a crucial inaccuracy making the statement factually wrong.  The composition of these deposits is complex and varies depending on the specific hydrothermal vent environment, but zinc is a consistently present component.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's steel sector:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption surpasses that of China, reflecting robust domestic demand.
2. The steel industry's reliance on imported coking coal contributes significantly to production costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that India's per capita finished steel consumption (97.7 kg in 2023-24) is significantly lower than China's (628.3 kg).  This highlights a key challenge for the Indian steel sector – low domestic consumption compared to global leaders.  The statement misrepresents the actual data.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that India largely relies on costly imports of coking coal from Australia to meet its needs. This dependence on imports significantly increases production costs and makes the Indian steel industry vulnerable to global price fluctuations and geopolitical events. This is a well-documented challenge faced by the Indian steel industry.


**3. With reference to seaweed farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is primarily undertaken in inland freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes.
2. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that seaweed cultivation is part of aquaculture and that seaweeds thrive in marine environments, including rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water. While some seaweed species might tolerate brackish water or even freshwater conditions, the primary focus of seaweed farming in the context of the provided information is marine environments. The statement falsely implies that seaweed farming is primarily in freshwater.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has set a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025. This is a specific policy goal mentioned in relation to the promotion of seaweed cultivation in India.


**4. Consider the following statements about India's silk production:**

1. India is the world's largest producer of silk, accounting for over half of global production.
2. Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are the leading silk-producing states in India, contributing nearly 60% of the total output.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India is the *second* largest silk producer globally, with 42% of global production in 2023, not over half.  This is a significant factual error, misrepresenting India's position in the global silk market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are indeed major silk-producing states, the text indicates that Karnataka contributes approximately 32% of India's total silk production. The combined contribution of both states is less than 60%. The statement overestimates their combined share.


**5. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti initiative is solely focused on improving road infrastructure across India.
2. The Digital Master Planning tool utilizes GIS technology and integrates data from various government ministries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PM GatiShakti initiative is a multimodal logistics plan, encompassing railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure. The statement incorrectly limits its scope to only road infrastructure.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly describes the Digital Master Planning tool as being developed using a GIS platform, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India's cloud), and integrating data from various ministries' ongoing and future projects.  This accurately reflects the technological underpinnings and data integration aspects of the PM GatiShakti plan.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by privatizing government-owned enterprises.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates both central and state-level PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is designed to generate investment by monetizing existing government assets, not by privatizing entire government-owned enterprises.  Monetization involves leveraging existing assets for revenue generation, typically through long-term leases or concessions, not outright sales. The statement incorrectly equates monetization with privatization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifies that the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects.  The statement incorrectly extends its purview to include state-level projects.  The committee's responsibilities are limited to the central government's PPP initiatives.


**7. With reference to India’s agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  The agricultural and allied sector contributed over 25% of India's Gross Value Added (GVA) at current prices in 2022-23.
2.  Mechanization of agricultural activities in India exceeds 60%, comparable to levels in China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the agricultural and allied sector accounted for 18.2% of the GVA at current prices in 2022-23, significantly less than 25%. This is a direct contradiction of the statement's claim.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that only 47% of agricultural activities are mechanized in India, which is lower than both China (60%) and Brazil (75%). The statement significantly overestimates the level of mechanization in Indian agriculture.


**8. Consider the following statements about Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) in India:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSPs for all agricultural commodities.
2. MSPs are announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure accurate price assessment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister.  The statement incorrectly assigns sole authority to the CACP.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that MSPs are announced at the *beginning* of the sowing season, not at the end of the harvesting season. This timing is crucial to allow farmers to make informed planting decisions based on the guaranteed minimum price.  The statement misrepresents the crucial timing of MSP announcements.


**9. With reference to India’s agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India’s agricultural exports surpassed the target of $60 billion by 2022, set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.
2. Rice is the largest agricultural export from India, accounting for more than 25% of the total agricultural exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set for 2022. This directly contradicts the claim made in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although rice is a significant agricultural export, the text indicates that it constitutes 21% of total exports, not more than 25%.  While it's a major export, the statement overestimates its share of total agricultural exports.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding India’s logistics sector:**

1. India is currently ranked among the top 25 countries globally in the Logistics Performance Index (LPI).
2. The National Logistics Policy (NLP) 2022 primarily focuses on improving hard infrastructure like road and rail networks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that India aims to be among the top 25 countries by 2030, but its current ranking in 2023 is 38th.  The statement falsely claims current inclusion in the top 25.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NLP 2022 addresses both hard and soft infrastructure aspects. While hard infrastructure is important, the policy also focuses on process reforms, digitization, and human resource development to improve the efficiency of the logistics sector.  The statement incorrectly restricts the policy's scope to only hard infrastructure improvements.


**1. With reference to the Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIF provides loans up to ₹5 Crores with a 5% interest subvention per annum and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE.
2.  The AIF scheme now includes integrated primary and secondary processing projects and allows convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM for farmer groups and cooperatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The AIF provides loans up to ₹2 Crores, not ₹5 Crores, with a 3% interest subvention per annum, and credit guarantee coverage under CGTMSE. The loan amount and interest subvention figures are misrepresented in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The recent expansion of AIF explicitly includes integrated primary and secondary processing projects as eligible activities.  Furthermore, it allows for convergence with Component-A of PM-KUSUM, facilitating collaboration between the schemes for farmer/group of farmers/ Farmer Producer Organizations/ Cooperatives/ Panchayats. This demonstrates an improved integration of agricultural support initiatives.


**2. With reference to India's initiatives for Agritech adoption, consider the following statements:**

1. The KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) project primarily focuses on improving crop yield estimation using satellite imagery and is a recent initiative launched in 2023.
2. The Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX) platform exclusively holds data on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crop-sown data, excluding other relevant agricultural information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, KISAN is indeed focused on improving yield estimation using space technology, but it's not a recent initiative launched in 2023; the provided text mentions its existence without a specific launch date. Second, the statement incorrectly implies that KISAN is the *primary* focus, neglecting other important agritech initiatives mentioned.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ADeX does hold the datasets mentioned, it's inaccurate to state it *exclusively* holds only these datasets. The implication is that no other agricultural data is present on the platform, which is a false simplification.


**3. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan utilizes a proprietary, closed-source technology platform developed by BISAG-N, limiting its accessibility and hindering collaborative efforts.
2.  The PM GatiShakti approach is driven by eight engines, encompassing railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, logistics infrastructure, and energy infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is explicitly built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India’s cloud), and integrates data from various sources.  The statement falsely claims it uses a proprietary and inaccessible platform, directly contradicting the provided information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti approach is driven by seven engines, not eight. The list includes railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure; energy infrastructure is not mentioned as a core component.


**4. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSP covers 25 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 7 Rabi crops, and 4 commercial crops.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP, without any further review or approval from any other government body.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that MSP covers 22 crops, not 25. The breakdown of Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops is also slightly different from what's stated in the question. The numbers are deliberately altered to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends the MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  The statement incorrectly suggests the CACP has the sole and final authority, omitting the crucial role of the CCEA in the MSP determination process.


**5. With reference to India’s Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, launched in 2018, aimed to achieve agricultural exports of $70 billion by 2024.
2.  Agricultural exports in India experienced a significant increase of 10% in 2023-24, exceeding the ambitious target set by the 2018 policy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text mentions an ambitious target of $60 billion by 2022 (not $70 billion by 2024) for agricultural exports set by India’s Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.  The figures are intentionally altered to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates an 8% *decline* in agricultural exports during 2023-24, falling short of the target.  The statement presents a completely opposite trend, creating a strong distractor.  The significant numerical change (from 8% decline to 10% increase) is designed to test the candidate's careful reading.


**6. With reference to the Public Stockholding (PSH) issue at the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1. The PSH policy allows governments to procure crops from farmers at market prices and distribute them to the poor through a complex system of subsidies and price controls.
2.  Developed countries at the WTO generally support increasing the de minimis limit for developing countries' agricultural subsidies to accommodate their PSH programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PSH policy allows governments to procure crops at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), not market prices.  The statement misrepresents the core mechanism of the PSH policy by substituting MSP with "market prices".  It also simplifies the distribution mechanism, avoiding the complexities involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Developed countries at the WTO generally *oppose* increasing the de minimis limit for developing countries' agricultural subsidies because they view PSH programs as market-distorting.  The statement presents the opposite viewpoint of developed countries, creating a significant distractor.  The reversal of the stance creates a challenging question.


**7. With reference to  Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) categorizes all collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹4,00,000 as microfinance loans.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises through specialized microfinance institutions (MFIs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals/groups belonging to low-income households with an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  The threshold income is deliberately increased to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMMY primarily targets non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, it doesn't exclusively channel loans through specialized MFIs.  Commercial banks and other NBFCs are also involved in disbursing these loans.  The statement incorrectly limits the disbursement channels.


**8. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The FI-Index is published bi-annually by the Ministry of Finance to assess the progress of financial inclusion initiatives.
2. The FI-Index incorporates data from the banking, investment, and insurance sectors, but excludes data from the postal and pension sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published *annually* (in July), not bi-annually, and it's published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Ministry of Finance. Both the frequency and the publishing authority are changed to create confusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index explicitly includes data from the banking, investment, insurance, postal, *and* pension sectors.  The statement incorrectly excludes the postal and pension sectors, omitting key components of the index.


**9. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) and the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, consider the following statements:**

1.  UCBs are brought under PCA if they breach risk thresholds related to capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability, but not liquidity or credit risk.
2. A UCB exits PCA once it demonstrates improved performance in all parameters for two consecutive quarterly financial statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While capital, asset quality, and profitability are key monitoring areas for UCBs under PCA, liquidity and credit risk are also significant factors.  The statement wrongly omits liquidity and credit risk as parameters for PCA implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A UCB exits PCA only after demonstrating consistent improvement (no breaches) over four consecutive quarterly financial statements, not just two. The number of consecutive quarters is reduced to create a distractor.  The subtle change in the number of quarters is designed to test the candidate's attention to detail.


**10. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1. RELOS is a bilateral agreement that exclusively facilitates the exchange of logistical support between the militaries of participating countries during wartime operations.
2.  India currently has similar logistics agreements with only the US, Japan, and Australia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RELOS facilitates the exchange of logistical support during both wartime *and* peacetime missions.  The restriction to only wartime operations is a deliberate simplification of the agreement's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Besides the US, Japan, and Australia, India has similar agreements with France, Singapore, and South Korea. The list of countries is deliberately shortened to create a distractor.  The omission of several countries makes this a challenging question.


**1. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is published bi-annually in January and July, incorporating data from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.
2.  The index uses a single-value scale ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete financial inclusion and 0 represents complete exclusion, with weighting given to Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is published *annually* in July, not bi-annually.  While it does encompass data from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors, the frequency of publication is stated incorrectly.

Statement 2 is correct. The FI-Index employs a single-value scale ranging from 0 to 100, accurately reflecting the extent of financial inclusion. The weighting assigned to Access (35%), Usage (45%), and Quality (20%) is also correctly stated.  This three-pronged approach provides a nuanced understanding of financial inclusion beyond mere access to financial services.


**2. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS, established under the RBI Act of 1934, covers all commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks, and all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) regardless of their asset size, aiming to provide a cost-free redressal of customer complaints.
2.  The scheme's coverage includes Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above, and Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with assets of ₹100 crore and above, excluding Housing Finance Companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RB-IOS does aim for cost-free redressal of customer complaints and is partially based on the RBI Act of 1934 (along with the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007), it *does not* cover all NBFCs.  The statement incorrectly broadens the scope of the scheme's coverage concerning NBFCs and their asset size.

Statement 2 is correct. The RB-IOS specifically outlines the inclusion criteria for Scheduled and Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks based on their deposit and asset sizes, respectively, accurately reflecting the information provided in the source text. The exclusion of Housing Finance Companies is also correctly stated.


**3. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000, and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) typically charge lower interest rates than commercial banks.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) categorizes loans under Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with the 2024 Union Budget expanding the Tarun category to include loans up to ₹20 lakh, accessible only to those who have previously availed and successfully repaid loans under the Kishore category.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. First, the annual income limit for households qualifying for microfinance loans is *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it. Second, MFIs typically charge *higher*, not lower, interest rates compared to commercial banks due to the higher risk involved in lending to this segment.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The 2024 Union Budget expanded the loan limit under PMMY to ₹20 lakh (creating a "Tarun Plus" category), but this was not limited to those who had previously successfully repaid loans under the *Kishore* category.  The expansion was for those who had successfully repaid loans under the *Tarun* category.


**4. With reference to the  Agri-Tech sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Economic Forum's “Agritech: Shaping Agriculture in Emerging Economies, Today and Tomorrow” report focuses on the role of agritech in shaping the agricultural ecosystem through intelligent crop planning, smart farming, and farmgate-to-fork initiatives, but excludes data as an enabler.
2.  India's FASAL project, launched in 2005, utilizes space technology, agro-meteorology, and land-based observations to provide short-term forecasts of crop output, while KISAN uses similar technologies for yield estimation and insurance purposes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WEF report explicitly includes "data as an enabler" as one of the four broad categories shaping the agricultural ecosystem through agritech.  The statement omits a key element of the report's scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FASAL project's focus on early crop output forecasting and KISAN's utilization of space technology for yield estimation and crop insurance are accurately described. The timelines and the technologies used by these projects are correctly mentioned.


**5. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Financial Stability Report (FSR) indicates that Scheduled commercial banks' Gross NPAs (GNPAs) and Net NPA ratios reached multi-year highs of 2.8% and 0.6%, respectively, at the end of March 2024.
2. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, facilitates the reorganization and insolvency resolution of corporate entities but excludes partnership firms and individuals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FSR reported multi-year *lows*, not highs, for GNPAs and Net NPA ratios at the end of March 2024.  The statement misrepresents the key finding of the report regarding NPA reduction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IBC, 2016, explicitly covers the reorganization and insolvency resolution of *both* corporate entities, *partnership firms*, and *individuals*.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the IBC's applicability.


**6. With reference to the  Indian Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The global MPI indicates that approximately 1 billion people (~18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty, with India having the second-largest number of people in extreme poverty.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and includes the original 10 indicators of the global MPI model, plus two additional indicators: maternal health and access to bank accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the global MPI does show approximately 1 billion people in acute multidimensional poverty, India is reported to have the *largest* number (234 million), not the second largest, of people in extreme poverty. The statement misrepresents the data on India's poverty numbers.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMPI's introduction date, data source (NFHS), inclusion of the original 10 global MPI indicators, and the addition of maternal health and bank account indicators are all accurately described.  The statement correctly reflects the key features of India's NMPI.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The fishing and aquaculture sector, which includes seaweed farming, contributes 1.5% to India's GDP, not more than 5%.  This figure reflects the current contribution and not the potential future contribution of seaweed farming.  The question attempts to mislead by exaggerating the economic impact.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana has indeed set a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025. This ambitious goal reflects the government's focus on promoting seaweed cultivation as a sustainable and economically viable activity.  The statement accurately reflects a key policy initiative.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the contribution of seaweed farming to India's GDP and the accuracy of the production target under the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana.  The question effectively tests knowledge of specific government schemes and their targets, as well as the economic contribution of a relatively niche agricultural sector.


**2. With reference to India's Silk Production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the world's leading producer of silk, accounting for over 50% of global production.
2.  Karnataka contributes the largest share to India's total silk production, exceeding 40%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is the second largest producer of silk globally, not the leading producer.  While India holds a significant share of the market,  the statement falsely inflates its position to over 50% to act as a distractor.  The actual figure is closer to 42% (2023 data).

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Karnataka is a major silk-producing state, its contribution is around 32%, not exceeding 40%. Andhra Pradesh holds the second-largest share of production.  The question misleads by overestimating Karnataka's contribution.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent both the ranking of India's silk production and the contribution of Karnataka to the national total. The question tests the ability of the candidate to recall precise data points about India's silk production and the state-wise distribution of this output. The slightly inaccurate figures make simple recall insufficient; the candidate must have precise knowledge.

2.  DFCs are designed to increase the share of rail freight traffic in India's overall freight transport from 27% (2019) to 45% (2030) as per the National Rail Plan 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DFCCIL was incorporated in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, not the 2013 Act. The question introduces a subtle but crucial error in the year of the Act to create confusion.

Statement 2 is correct.  The aim of DFCs, as outlined in the National Rail Plan 2030, is to significantly increase the share of rail freight traffic from 27% in 2019 to 45% in 2030. This statement accurately reflects a key policy objective.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in the year of the Indian Companies Act mentioned in the first statement. The question tests knowledge of the legal framework governing DFCs and the broader goals of the National Rail Plan 2030 regarding freight transport. The subtle difference in the year of the Act is a significant distractor, emphasizing the need for precise factual recall.

1.  The MSP covers 22 crops, including 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops (Jute and Copra).
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all crops, with no government oversight.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MSP mechanism indeed covers 22 crops, with the categorization into Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops accurately representing the current structure.  The statement presents a factual overview of the crops included in the MSP scheme.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.  This statement incorrectly implies that the CACP has absolute authority, ignoring the crucial role of the government in the final decision-making process.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the decision-making process for determining MSPs. The question tests knowledge of the crops covered under the MSP system and the institutional framework for determining MSPs.

2. The Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry releases the ICI data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICI includes only eight core industries, not nine.  Petroleum refinery products have the highest weight (28.04%), not the lowest, in the ICI. The question attempts to mislead by altering the number of industries and misrepresenting the weight assigned to petroleum refinery products.

Statement 2 is correct. The Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry is responsible for releasing the ICI data.  This statement accurately identifies the releasing agency for the ICI data.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the components of the ICI and the government body responsible for its release.  The manipulated data in statement 1 serves as a substantial distractor, highlighting the need for precise factual knowledge.


**10. With reference to the Navratna status granted to Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Public Enterprises grants Navratna status to PSUs based solely on their profitability and market capitalization.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's per capita finished steel consumption (97.7 kg in 2023-24) is significantly lower than the world average (219.3 kg).  The statement falsely claims that India's consumption exceeds the global average.

Statement 2 is correct. The government has indeed set a target of 500 million tonnes of steel production by 2034.  This statement accurately reflects a key policy objective for the steel sector.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent India's per capita steel consumption.

2.  The plan integrates data from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and inland waterways projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan is built on open-source technology, hosted on Meghraj (Government of India's cloud).  The statement falsely claims the use of only proprietary systems.

Statement 2 is correct. The plan does integrate data from various ministries, including those involved in projects like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and inland waterways.  This integration is crucial for coordinated infrastructure development.

1.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for all aspects of PPP project implementation.
2.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising government assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit plays a significant role, it is not solely responsible for all aspects of PPP project implementation. Other bodies like the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee also play crucial roles.  The statement oversimplifies the institutional framework for PPPs.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMP's primary objective is to generate investment by monetising existing government assets.  This statement accurately reflects the NMP's core purpose.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the institutional arrangements for PPPs in India. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the institutional framework governing PPPs and the objectives of the National Monetisation Pipeline.  The oversimplified description of the Private Investment Unit's role in statement 1 acts as a significant distractor.


**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership focused exclusively on providing financial aid to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) for infrastructure development.
2.  The EIF's Trust Fund Manager is the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and it receives significant funding from the World Trade Organization (WTO).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF is a *multilateral*, not bilateral, partnership.  Its focus is broader than just infrastructure; it aims to assist LDCs in using trade as a driver for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.  The statement incorrectly restricts its purpose to solely infrastructure development and mischaracterizes the nature of the partnership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The EIF's Trust Fund Manager is the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), not the IMF. While the WTO is a supporter of the EIF,  the statement exaggerates its role in funding.  The EIF receives support from various international organizations, including the World Bank, but the WTO's contribution isn't the primary or defining source of funding.  The statement also mistakenly attributes the management role to the IMF.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act of 2022 to replace the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
2. The DBN's funding primarily comes from a 10% levy on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of all telecom licensees.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN was established through the Telecommunications Act of 2023, not 2022.  The year is a crucial detail, and the inaccuracy makes the statement false.  It correctly identifies the replacement of the USOF, but the incorrect year invalidates the entire statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The USOF, which the DBN replaced, was funded by a 5% levy on the AGR of telecom licensees, not 10%.  The statement incorrectly inflates the percentage. The DBN's funding mechanism might be similar, but the stated percentage is factually wrong.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE will be established as a Section 10 Company under the Companies Act, 2013, and its provisional name is the Indian Institute for Digital Creators.
2. The establishment of the NCoE was proposed in the 2021-22 budget announcements.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE will be a Section 8 Company, not a Section 10 Company, under the Companies Act, 2013. The difference between Section 8 and Section 10 companies is significant in terms of their purpose and regulations. The provisional name is also slightly different; it's the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC), not the Indian Institute for Digital Creators.  The errors in both parts of the statement render it false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The establishment of the NCoE was proposed in the 2022-23 budget announcements, not 2021-22. The fiscal year is a critical detail, making the year's inaccuracy significant.


**4. With reference to the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) and Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  MAP primarily resolves transfer pricing disputes related to past transactions, while APAs prevent future transfer pricing disputes.
2.  Taxpayers can utilize MAP for resolving disputes arising from tax treaties, but APAs are not applicable for resolving treaty-related issues.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  MAP (Mutual Agreement Procedure) is a mechanism for resolving *existing* double taxation disputes arising from interpretations of tax treaties. APAs (Advance Pricing Agreements), on the other hand, are proactive measures taken *before* transactions to establish acceptable transfer pricing methods, thus preventing future disputes.  The statement accurately reflects the core difference in their application.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While MAP is used to resolve disputes arising from tax treaties, APAs can also be relevant in preventing disputes related to transfer pricing under those same treaties.  Therefore, APAs are not entirely excluded from treaty-related issues. The statement wrongly implies that APAs are unrelated to tax treaties.


**5. With reference to the OECD Global Minimum Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. The OECD Global Minimum Tax is based on the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules and mandates a minimum tax rate of 20% on corporate profits globally.
2. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is a separate initiative, unrelated to the OECD Global Minimum Tax.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The OECD Global Minimum Tax mandates a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, not 20%, on corporate profits. This is a critical factual inaccuracy. While it is based on the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules, the incorrect percentage renders the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS is directly related to the OECD Global Minimum Tax.  The Global Minimum Corporate Tax (GMCT), a key component of Pillar Two within the BEPS framework, is essentially the OECD Global Minimum Tax.  The statement falsely suggests a separation between these closely linked initiatives.


**6.  With reference to the Duty Drawback scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Duty Drawback scheme, under Section 76 of the Customs Act, 1962, refunds customs duties paid on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods.
2. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) disburses duty drawback amounts through a manual process to ensure transparency and accuracy.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Duty Drawback scheme, under Section 75 (not 76) of the Customs Act, 1962, does indeed rebate customs duties paid on imported or excisable materials used in producing export goods.  The minor error in the section number doesn't significantly alter the core meaning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBIC now uses an electronic disbursement system via the Public Finance Management System (PFMS), not a manual process. The statement incorrectly describes the current method of disbursement.


**7. With reference to Windfall Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. Windfall tax is a tax imposed on industries experiencing unusually low profits due to unfavorable economic conditions to stabilize the economy.
2.  The reduction of windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil is a measure to reduce the burden on consumers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Windfall tax targets industries with *unusually high* profits due to favorable economic conditions, not low profits.  The statement incorrectly describes the circumstances under which windfall tax is applied.

Statement 2 is plausible and generally correct. Reducing the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil can indirectly lower the cost of production and potentially lessen the burden on consumers through lower fuel prices. While not a direct effect, it's a reasonable consequence.


**8. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GII 2024 ranked India 40th among 133 nations, maintaining its position from 2023.
2.  The GII 2024's theme was "Unlocking the Promise of Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development."

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's ranking improved by one position from 40th to 39th in the GII 2024.  The statement incorrectly states that India maintained its 40th position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The theme of the GII 2024 was "Unlocking the Promise of Social Entrepreneurship," not "Unlocking the Promise of Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Development." The statement misrepresents the actual theme.


**9. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agreement aims to curb harmful subsidies that contribute to the depletion of the world's fish stocks, with a special and differential treatment for developed countries.
2. The Agreement has already come into effect, requiring acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies provides special and differential treatment for *developing* countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), not developed countries.  The statement incorrectly assigns the preferential treatment to the wrong group of nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. As of December 2024, the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies is *not* yet in effect.  It still requires the acceptance of two-thirds of WTO members. The statement incorrectly claims it has already come into effect.


**10. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement was established in 1990 as part of the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2. The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, with flexibility for member countries to exceed these standards.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement was part of the *Uruguay Round* of GATT negotiations, not the Tokyo Round.  The statement incorrectly identifies the GATT round in which TRIPS was negotiated.  The TRIPS Agreement came into force in 1995.

Statement 2 is correct.  The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards, but member countries are allowed to provide higher levels of IPR protection if they choose.  The statement accurately describes the flexibility afforded to member countries in implementing the agreement.


**11. With reference to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), consider the following statements:**

1.  IRDAI's initiatives have resulted in a decline in insurance penetration and density in India.
2.  IRDAI aims to achieve universal insurance coverage ("Insurance for All") by 2047, encompassing life, health, and property insurance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IRDAI's initiatives have led to an *increase*, not a decline, in both insurance penetration and density in India. The statement presents the opposite of the actual trend.

Statement 2 is correct. IRDAI has publicly committed to achieving universal insurance coverage by 2047, covering various aspects of insurance like life, health, and property. The statement accurately reflects IRDAI's stated goal.


**12. With reference to the World Bank's Business-Ready (B-Ready) Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The B-Ready Index replaced the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings in 2022.
2. The B-Ready Index includes all 193 member countries of the United Nations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EoDB rankings were discontinued in 2021, not 2022, and the B-Ready Index is a *replacement* but not a direct one-to-one substitute. The year is incorrectly stated, and the nature of the replacement is not fully accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The initial rollout of the B-Ready Index in 2024 only included 50 economies, not all 193 UN member countries.  The statement greatly overestimates the scope of the index.


**13. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty was adopted by a majority vote in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), with significant opposition from developing countries.
2. The treaty is legally binding upon adoption, requiring no further ratification by member states.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The treaty was adopted by *consensus* among more than 150 countries, including India. There was no significant opposition from developing countries. The statement incorrectly characterizes both the voting process and the level of opposition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The treaty will come into force three months after 15 parties have ratified it.  It's not automatically binding upon adoption. The statement is entirely false regarding the legal status and implementation of the treaty.


**14. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMF primarily lends for specific development projects, similar to development banks.
2. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) provides non-concessional financial support at market-based interest rates.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMF does *not* primarily lend for specific projects like development banks. Its lending is more focused on crisis response and macroeconomic stability.  The statement incorrectly describes the nature of IMF lending.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PRGT provides *concessional* financial support, currently at zero interest rates, specifically tailored to low-income countries. The statement misrepresents both the type of support and the interest rate structure.


**15. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1. The WBG-GP aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $10 billion by 2030.
2. The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and experts from various World Bank Group institutions under the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WBG-GP aims to *increase*, not reduce, the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030.  The statement presents the opposite of the platform's goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WBG-GP consolidates guarantee products and experts under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), not the IFC.  The statement mistakenly identifies the coordinating institution.


**1. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EIF is a multilateral partnership solely dedicated to assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction.
2.  The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) serves as the EIF Trust Fund Manager, and the World Bank and World Trade Organization (WTO) provide financial and technical support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF). Statement 1 correctly identifies the EIF's primary and unique focus on helping LDCs leverage trade for development.  The EIF's mandate is specifically targeted at these countries, distinguishing it from other trade-related initiatives. Statement 2 is also correct; UNOPS manages the EIF Trust Fund, while the World Bank and WTO provide crucial support, highlighting the multi-stakeholder nature of the EIF's operations and the collaborative approach to development assistance.  The involvement of these international organizations underscores the framework's importance and the global recognition of the need to support LDC trade development.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in either statement.


**2. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was funded through a license fee charged on licensees of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). This fee was calculated at 10% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue.
2.  The DBN aims to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas, ensuring affordable access, thereby bridging the digital divide and promoting inclusive growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the DBN's objective.  The fund aims to improve telecom infrastructure and affordability in underserved regions, aligning with broader goals of digital inclusion and equitable development.  Statement 1, however, contains an inaccuracy. While the DBN did indeed replace the USOF and the USOF was funded by a levy on DoT licensees, the levy was 5% of the Adjusted Gross Revenue, not 10%. This minor factual error makes statement 1 incorrect despite the other parts being correct.  The precise percentage is a crucial detail in understanding the financial mechanisms of the USOF and its successor, the DBN.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCoE-AVGC-XR, established as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, was initially proposed as a task force in the 2021-22 budget.
2.  The NCoE-AVGC-XR, provisionally named the Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC), aims to promote innovation and skill development in the AVGC-XR sector, fostering growth and global competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the goals and structure of the NCoE-AVGC-XR.  Its aim is to cultivate talent and innovation in the rapidly expanding AVGC-XR sector, driving economic growth and establishing India's presence on the global stage.  Statement 1, however, contains an error.  While the NCoE is indeed a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, and is provisionally named IIIC, it was proposed in the 2022-23 budget, not the 2021-22 budget. This subtle difference in the budget year is a significant factual inaccuracy. The correct budget year is crucial for understanding the timeline of policy implementation. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**4. With reference to the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GII 2024, released by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Cornell University, and INSEAD Business School, ranked India 40th among 133 nations, showing a one-position improvement from 2023.
2.  The GII 2024's theme was "Unlocking the Promise of Social Entrepreneurship," and India secured the top rank in both lower middle-income economies and the Central and Southern Asia region for Knowledge and technology outputs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly highlights the theme of the GII 2024 and India's top ranking in specific categories within the index.  The focus on social entrepreneurship reflects a growing global emphasis on innovation's social impact.  India's leading position in Knowledge and technology outputs within its economic and regional groups showcases its strengths in these areas.  Statement 1, however, is incorrect.  While the GII 2024 was indeed released by the mentioned organizations, India's ranking was 39th, not 40th, representing a one-position improvement from its 2023 ranking. This seemingly small numerical difference is a crucial factual inaccuracy.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**5. With reference to Multimodal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The government has planned to develop 35 MMLPs with an investment outlay of $6.2 billion, aiming to enhance logistics efficiency and reduce transportation costs across various modes of transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of the Indian government's initiative to develop MMLPs. Statement 1 correctly states the number of planned MMLPs and the projected investment. This demonstrates the scale of the government's commitment to improving its logistics infrastructure. Statement 2 is also correct in that MMLPs are specifically designed to integrate different transport modes, creating a more efficient and cost-effective system for moving goods. The integration of different modes is a key feature of MMLPs, aiming to address inefficiencies in the current logistics system.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the plan and purpose of MMLPs.


**6. With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RELOS agreement, approved by Russia, allows the militaries of India and Russia to access each other's logistics and support facilities, including fuel, rations, and spare parts, only during wartime operations.
2.  India has similar logistics agreements with countries like the US, Japan, Australia, France, Singapore, and South Korea, facilitating military cooperation and interoperability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately lists several countries with which India has established similar logistics agreements.  These agreements enhance military cooperation and logistical support during various operations, including peacetime missions.  Statement 1, however, is incorrect.  While the RELOS agreement does allow access to logistics and support facilities, this access extends to both wartime and peacetime missions, not solely wartime. The inclusion of peacetime operations is a crucial aspect of the agreement, expanding its scope beyond purely military conflict scenarios.  This factual inaccuracy makes statement 1 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  India Stack, India's foundational DPI, comprises three interconnected layers: the Identity Layer (Aadhaar), the Payment Layer (UPI), and the Data Governance Layer (DigiLocker), promoting digital inclusion and financial access.
2.  The One Future Alliance, a voluntary initiative proposed by the G20 India Presidency, aims to establish a Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) to accelerate DPI implementation in low and middle-income countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the three core layers of India Stack and their respective examples.  This accurately depicts the architecture of India's DPI, highlighting its modular and interconnected nature.  Statement 2, however, is partially incorrect. While the One Future Alliance is a G20 initiative aimed at supporting DPI adoption in developing countries, it does not aim to establish a Global DPI Repository (GDPIR). The GDPIR was announced separately, not as a direct goal of the One Future Alliance. This distinction is a factual inaccuracy.  The separate announcement of the GDPIR indicates a different mechanism for global DPI support. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**8. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UPI, launched in 2016, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which was incorporated under the Payment and Settlements Systems Act, 2007, by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA).
2.  NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) has partnered with several countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and France, to expand the reach of UPI beyond India, promoting financial inclusion and cross-border payments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key facts about the UPI and its international expansion. Statement 1 correctly identifies the UPI's launch year, developer (NPCI), and the legal framework under which NPCI operates.  It also correctly names the founding bodies of the NPCI. Statement 2 is also correct in mentioning NIPL's partnerships to extend UPI's reach internationally.  The inclusion of Trinidad and Tobago, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and France demonstrates the growing global interest in the UPI's model.  The internationalization of UPI is a significant development in global finance. Therefore, both statements are accurate and provide a good overview of the UPI's development and expansion.


**9. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Treaty, adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), requires ratification by two-thirds of WIPO member states (including India) before coming into force, aiming to improve the patent system and prevent erroneous patent grants.
2. The Treaty acknowledges the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), aiming to ensure that the protection of intellectual property rights does not infringe upon the rights of indigenous communities over their traditional knowledge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the WIPO Treaty. Statement 1 correctly describes the ratification process required for the treaty to come into force. The two-thirds threshold is a standard requirement for many international agreements. The aim of improving the patent system and preventing erroneous grants is a central objective of the treaty. Statement 2 is also correct; the treaty explicitly acknowledges UNDRIP, demonstrating a commitment to balancing intellectual property rights with the rights of indigenous communities.  This recognition is crucial for ensuring equitable access to and benefit-sharing from genetic resources and traditional knowledge. Therefore, both statements are accurate and reflect the treaty's objectives and mechanisms.


**10. With reference to India's measures to protect Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Genetic Resources (GRs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) serves as a digital repository to prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents, while the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, safeguards farmers' rights over plant varieties.
2. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, aligns with the Convention on Biological Diversity, ensuring the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of biological resources, while the Geographical Indications Act, 1999, protects collective rights over traditional knowledge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe different aspects of India's legal and policy framework for protecting TK and GRs.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the TKDL's role in preventing biopiracy and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Act, 2001, as a key piece of legislation safeguarding farmers' rights.  These measures are crucial for preventing the misappropriation of traditional knowledge and ensuring the fair compensation of farmers. Statement 2 is also correct in highlighting the Biological Diversity Act's alignment with the Convention on Biological Diversity and its emphasis on equitable benefit-sharing.  The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, provides further protection for collective rights over traditional knowledge.  These measures demonstrate a multi-faceted approach to safeguarding TK and GRs.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**11. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus, a multilateral initiative conceptualized by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, aims to facilitate instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS), such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is a participant in Project Nexus, which is expected to go live by 2025, connecting IPS in four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Project Nexus's core objective – enabling instant cross-border payments through the interconnection of domestic IPS.  The mention of the BIS Innovation Hub correctly identifies the initiative's originator. The inclusion of UPI as an example of an IPS is also accurate. Statement 2, however, contains an inaccuracy regarding the projected launch date.  While the RBI is indeed a participant and the ASEAN countries are involved, the expected launch date is 2026, not 2025. This difference in the year is a factual error. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**12. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendments to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, aim to streamline the investment process for Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs), encouraging greater foreign investment in Indian venture capital undertakings.
2.  Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) are investors incorporated outside India, registered under the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, making investments in venture capital funds registered with SEBI or venture capital undertakings in India (unlisted companies).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the context of the SEBI amendments and the definition of FVCIs.  Statement 1 correctly points out that the amendments aim to simplify the investment process for FVCIs, thereby attracting more foreign investment into Indian ventures.  This is a key policy goal, aiming to boost the Indian startup ecosystem. Statement 2 provides a correct description of FVCIs, their incorporation outside India, and their investment targets.  The specification of unlisted companies is crucial to understanding the nature of their investments.  Therefore, both statements accurately describe the regulatory changes and their implications.


**13. With reference to the National Technical Textiles Mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Technical Textiles Mission aims to position India as a global leader in technical textiles, leveraging the country's existing strengths in the textile sector and fostering innovation and technological advancements.

This ambition reflects India's desire to move up the value chain in manufacturing. Statement 2 correctly highlights the mission's promotion of technical textile usage through government schemes like the PLI and MITRA schemes.  These initiatives provide incentives and support for the growth of the sector.  The combination of ambitious goals and supportive policies indicates a comprehensive strategy for the development of the technical textiles sector in India.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**14. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICI, released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, measures the combined and individual performance of eight core industries, which constitute approximately 45% of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2.  The eight core industries included in the ICI are Fertilizers, Cement, Natural Gas, Crude Oil, Coal, Electricity, Steel, and Petroleum Refinery Products, with Petroleum Refinery Products having the highest weight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately lists the eight core industries and correctly identifies Petroleum Refinery Products as having the highest weight within the ICI.  This information is essential for understanding the composition and weighting of the index. Statement 1, however, is partially incorrect. While the ICI is indeed released by the Office of the Economic Adviser and measures the performance of the eight core industries, they constitute approximately 40.27% of the IIP weight, not 45%. This difference in the percentage is a crucial factual inaccuracy. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**15. With reference to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending instruments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMF provides financial support to countries facing crises, primarily through its General Resources Account (GRA), which offers loans at concessional interest rates tailored to the specific needs of low-income countries.
2.  The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) provide concessional financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, respectively, for building resilience to external shocks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly identifies the PRGT and RST as providing concessional financing to low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries, respectively, focusing on building resilience.  This accurately reflects the purpose and target beneficiaries of these specific IMF lending facilities. Statement 1, however, is partially incorrect.  While the IMF does provide financial support during crises, the GRA does *not* offer loans at concessional rates; these are market-based interest rates.  The statement mistakenly attributes concessional lending to the GRA, which is a characteristic of other IMF facilities.  This inaccuracy makes statement 1 incorrect. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**16. With reference to the World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WBG-GP, launched in 2024, aims to consolidate all guarantee products and experts from across the World Bank Group (WBG) institutions under the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), aiming to increase WBG annual guarantee issuance to $15 billion by 2030.
2.  The WBG provides guarantees to private lenders for infrastructure projects facing significant political and sovereign risks, offering credit guarantees, trade finance guarantees, and political risk insurance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the types of guarantees offered by the WBG and the types of projects they support.  This highlights the WBG's role in mitigating risks and facilitating private sector involvement in infrastructure development. Statement 1, however, contains an inaccuracy. While the WBG-GP aims to consolidate guarantee operations under MIGA, and it is intended to boost guarantee issuance, the target is $20 billion, not $15 billion, by 2030.  This difference in the target amount is a significant factual error. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**17. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Agreement aims to curb harmful fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks, allowing a transition period of 2 years for developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) from the date of its entry into force.
2.  The Agreement has been accepted by two-thirds of WTO members, coming into effect immediately, with India being a signatory and actively participating in its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Agreement's objective – to reduce harmful fisheries subsidies – and correctly mentions the transition period for developing countries and LDCs.  This reflects the agreement's consideration for the varying capacities of different nations. Statement 2, however, contains several inaccuracies.  The Agreement has *not* yet been accepted by two-thirds of WTO members, and it has therefore not yet come into force.  Furthermore, India is *not* a signatory to the agreement. These factual inaccuracies render statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**18. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The TRIPS Agreement, a key part of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), sets minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and came into force on January 1, 1996.
2.  The TRIPS Agreement, evolved during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), aims to harmonize IPR protection globally, ensuring a fair and equitable balance between the interests of producers and consumers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the TRIPS Agreement's origin, purpose, and overall goals.  The reference to the Uruguay Round and the aim of harmonizing IPR protection are both correct. The statement also correctly identifies the balance between producers and consumers as an important aspect of the agreement. Statement 1, however, contains an inaccuracy. While the TRIPS Agreement is indeed part of the Marrakesh Agreement and sets minimum IPR standards, its entry into force was on January 1, 1995, not 1996. This one-year difference is a factual inaccuracy.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.



**1. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The HDR, released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), primarily focuses on economic growth indicators to assess human development.
2. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is a core component of the HDR, measuring inequalities across various dimensions like reproductive health, empowerment, and the labor market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While economic growth is a factor considered in human development, the HDR's primary focus is a broader assessment of human development encompassing health, education, and living standards, not solely economic growth.  The Human Development Index (HDI) is the core of the HDR, and while it incorporates economic indicators (GNI per capita), it's not solely focused on them.  The HDR also examines major global challenges affecting human development beyond pure economic metrics.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is indeed a key component of the HDR, specifically designed to measure gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation.  This index provides a crucial perspective on human development disparities based on gender.  The HDR uses the GII to highlight the extent to which gender inequality hinders overall human development progress.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI):**

1. The 2024 MPI report, published jointly by the UNDP and OPHI, revealed that less than 10% of the global population lives in acute multidimensional poverty.
2. The MPI considers deprivations across education, health, and living standards, with individuals deemed "MPI poor" if deprived in at least one-third of the weighted indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 MPI report indicated that approximately 1.1 billion people (around 18%), not less than 10%, live in acute multidimensional poverty across the 112 countries assessed.  This highlights the significant global challenge of multidimensional poverty, which goes beyond a simple income-based poverty measure.  India, with 234 million people, had the largest number of individuals living in extreme poverty.

Statement 2 is correct. The MPI is indeed a multidimensional poverty measure that assesses deprivations across education, health, and living standards.  The threshold for classifying someone as "MPI poor" is deprivation in at least one-third of the weighted indicators used in the index. This methodology provides a more nuanced understanding of poverty than simply looking at income levels.


**3. With reference to India's National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMPI, introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, utilizes data from the National Sample Survey (NSS) to calculate the index.
2. The NMPI calculation involves multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A), where 'A' represents the average proportion of deprivations experienced by multidimensionally poor individuals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NMPI uses data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), not the National Sample Survey (NSS). The NFHS provides crucial data on health and other aspects of household living conditions, making it a suitable data source for the NMPI's multidimensional approach.  The NSS focuses on a broader range of socio-economic data but is not the primary source for the NMPI.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMPI's value is indeed calculated by multiplying the headcount ratio (H), representing the percentage of the population below the poverty line, and the intensity of poverty (A), which measures the average proportion of deprivations experienced by those classified as multidimensionally poor. This formula provides a comprehensive picture of poverty's depth and breadth within the population.


**4. With reference to the "Polycrisis" concept, as described by the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank's report, "Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet," suggests that global poverty reduction has accelerated significantly over the past five years due to effective policy interventions.
2.  The "Prosperity Gap," as defined in the report, refers to the disparity between the global average income and the income required to achieve a prosperity standard of $25 per person per day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Bank's report actually indicates that global poverty reduction and the narrowing of the prosperity gap have stalled, not accelerated, during the past five years. This stagnation is attributed to the confluence of multiple crises, collectively termed a "polycrisis," which includes slow economic growth, increased economic fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty.  Effective policy interventions have been hampered by these interconnected challenges.


Statement 2 is correct. The "Prosperity Gap" in the World Bank's report accurately describes the difference between the global average income and the income level necessary to achieve a prosperity standard of $25 per person per day. This gap highlights the significant income inequality and the substantial economic advancement required to bring everyone to a minimum prosperity level.


**5. With reference to India's Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural crops, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is the maximum price at which the government purchases crops from farmers, aiming to prevent distress sales below market value.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs, but the final decision rests with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MSP represents the *minimum*, not maximum, price at which the government purchases crops from farmers.  The objective is to provide a safety net, ensuring farmers receive a price that covers their production costs and prevents distress sales at significantly lower market prices.  The MSP acts as a floor price, guaranteeing a minimum return for their produce.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the CACP does recommend MSPs, the final decision-making authority rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister, not solely the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare. The CCEA considers various economic factors and policy implications before finalizing the MSP for different crops.


**6. With reference to India's agricultural export policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's agricultural exports have consistently exceeded the ambitious target set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy.
2. The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was primarily due to increased domestic demand, exceeding export capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in India registered an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 Agricultural Export Policy. This indicates a failure to meet the ambitious export goals, highlighting challenges in the agricultural export sector.

Statement 2 is partially correct but incomplete. While increased domestic demand might have played a role, the statement is an oversimplification.  The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24 was likely a result of multiple factors, including global market conditions, logistical challenges, and perhaps policy-related issues, not solely due to increased domestic demand surpassing export capacity. A more comprehensive analysis is required to identify the primary causes.


**7. With reference to seaweed farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Seaweed cultivation is considered a part of aquaculture, a sector that contributes a significant portion (over 5%) of India's GDP.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tonnes per year by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seaweed cultivation is indeed part of aquaculture, the text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector contributes 1.5% of India's GDP, not a significant portion exceeding 5%.  This highlights the relatively smaller contribution of this sector compared to other economic activities in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tonnes per year by 2025, not 2030. This ambitious goal underscores the government's focus on developing the seaweed value chain and its potential economic and environmental benefits. The earlier timeframe reflects the urgency and importance placed on this initiative.


**8. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and its National Institute of Secondary Agriculture (NISA), consider the following statements:**

1. ICAR-NISA was established in 1929 as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums, later renamed in 2022.
2. Secondary agriculture encompasses activities like beekeeping, poultry farming, and agricultural tourism, involving value addition to primary agricultural products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ICAR-NISA was established in 1924, not 1929, as the Indian Institute of Natural Resins and Gums.  The renaming to ICAR-NISA occurred in 2022, reflecting a shift in focus and organizational structure. The earlier establishment date indicates a longer history and evolution of the institute's contributions to agricultural research.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of secondary agriculture accurately encompasses value-addition activities like beekeeping, poultry farming, and agricultural tourism. These activities transform primary agricultural products or by-products into higher-value commodities, contributing significantly to the agricultural economy and rural livelihoods.  This diversification is crucial for sustainable agricultural development.


**9. With reference to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The PLFS, launched in 2018, estimates key employment and unemployment indicators annually.
2. According to the 2023 PLFS data, India's unemployment rate was significantly higher than the global average unemployment rate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The PLFS was launched in 2017, not 2018.  While it does provide estimates of key employment and unemployment indicators, the frequency is not strictly annual; it provides data on a periodic basis.  The slight inaccuracy in the launch year doesn't invalidate the survey's importance in providing crucial labor market data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023 PLFS data indicated that India's unemployment rate was 3.1%, which is significantly *lower* than the global average unemployment rate of 5.1%.  This finding highlights a contrast between India's labor market performance and the global trend, though further analysis is needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to this difference.


**10. With reference to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All collateral-free loans granted to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹300,000 are categorized as microfinance loans by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans through MFIs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals belonging to low-income households with an annual income *up to* ₹300,000, not exceeding it.  This income limit is crucial in targeting the intended beneficiaries of microfinance schemes. Exceeding this limit would exclude the very population microfinance aims to help.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMMY does provide loans to micro and small enterprises, it doesn't exclusively channel funds through MFIs.  PMMY loans are disbursed through various institutions, including commercial banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), in addition to MFIs, broadening the reach and access to credit for eligible entrepreneurs.  This diversification of lending channels is a key feature of PMMY's design.



**1. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The MPI, launched in 2010, measures poverty based solely on income levels, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of economic deprivation.
2.  India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021, utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and includes indicators such as maternal health and bank account access.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MPI is a multidimensional measure, not solely based on income. It considers multiple deprivations across education, health, and living standards.  While income is a crucial aspect of poverty, the MPI recognizes that poverty is a complex phenomenon encompassing various dimensions of well-being.  The MPI aims to provide a more holistic and nuanced understanding of poverty than income-based measures alone.  Its indicators include access to clean cooking fuel, sanitation, nutrition, child mortality, schooling years, and more, providing a far broader perspective than a simple income threshold.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMPI, introduced by NITI Aayog in 2021, indeed uses data from the NFHS.  Crucially, it expands upon the global MPI model by incorporating additional indicators relevant to the Indian context, including maternal health and bank account access. This reflects the Indian government's efforts to tailor poverty measurement to its specific challenges and priorities. The inclusion of these indicators highlights the government's focus on broader social and financial inclusion as part of its poverty reduction strategy.


**2. With reference to the Human Development Index (HDI) and related indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender disparities solely in reproductive health, and India consistently ranks poorly in this index due to high maternal mortality rates.
2. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the loss in HDI due to inequality, and India's rank in the IHDI is consistently higher than its rank in the HDI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GII measures gender inequalities across three key dimensions: reproductive health (including maternal mortality), empowerment (including educational attainment and political representation), and economic activity (including labor market participation). While high maternal mortality rates contribute negatively to India's GII, the index encompasses a broader range of factors affecting gender equality.  Attributing India's poor ranking solely to maternal mortality is an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IHDI adjusts the HDI to account for inequality. Because the IHDI incorporates inequality, a country's IHDI value will always be lower than or equal to its HDI value.  Therefore, India's rank in the IHDI will always be lower than or equal to its rank in the HDI, reflecting the impact of inequality on its overall human development.  A higher rank in the IHDI would imply a lower level of inequality, which contradicts the nature of the index.


**3.  With reference to India's agricultural sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme provides direct income support to all farmers in India, regardless of landholding size or crop cultivated.
2. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism ensures that all farmers receive a price for their produce that is at least equal to the MSP, effectively eliminating distress sales.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PM-KISAN provides income support to small and marginal farmers, it does not cover all farmers in India.  Eligibility criteria are based on factors like landholding size and other parameters.  The scheme aims to provide a safety net for small farmers, but it's not a universal income support program for all agricultural producers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MSP mechanism sets a minimum price at which the government is willing to procure certain crops. However, it does not guarantee that all farmers will receive the MSP.  Several factors, including logistical challenges, market dynamics, and farmer participation in government procurement schemes, can affect whether farmers actually receive the MSP for their produce.  Distress sales can still occur, especially for farmers who don't have access to government procurement channels.


**4. With reference to India's financial sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), including Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), through a unified regulatory framework.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans to women entrepreneurs, promoting gender equality in access to credit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI regulates NBFCs, including MFIs, the regulatory framework isn't entirely unified.  Different categories of NBFCs face varying regulatory requirements depending on their size, activities, and risk profile.  MFIs have specific regulations under the RBI's purview, but these are not completely identical to those governing other types of NBFCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. While women entrepreneurs can certainly avail of these loans, the scheme is not exclusively for women. It aims to cater to a broader range of micro and small enterprises, regardless of gender.  The scheme promotes entrepreneurship across various segments, not exclusively focusing on women-owned businesses.


**5. With reference to India's efforts towards oilseed self-sufficiency, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) primarily focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation in the northern plains of India, due to their suitable climatic conditions.
2. The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) aims to ensure that oilseed farmers receive the Minimum Support Price (MSP) through direct cash transfers, irrespective of market prices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMEO-OP focuses on expanding oil palm cultivation in the North Eastern States and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, not the northern plains.  These regions are considered more suitable for oil palm cultivation due to their climatic conditions. The northern plains are not ideal for oil palm cultivation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PM-AASHA aims to ensure MSP through price support schemes and price deficiency payment schemes, but it doesn't guarantee direct cash transfers irrespective of market prices.  The mechanisms under PM-AASHA involve various interventions to ensure that farmers receive at least the MSP for their produce, but the actual implementation methods can vary.  The scheme aims to mitigate price volatility and ensure fair prices to farmers, but not necessarily through direct cash transfers alone.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report, 2024, indicates that approximately 18% of the global population lives in acute multidimensional poverty, with India having the largest number of people in extreme poverty.
2. The World Bank's report, ‘Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet: Pathways out of the Polycrisis,’ highlights a stagnation in global poverty reduction and the global prosperity gap over the past five years, attributing this to a "polycrisis" characterized by slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect information from the provided text. Statement 1 correctly cites the Global MPI report's finding that around 18% of the global population (approximately 1.1 billion people) experiences acute multidimensional poverty, with India reporting the highest number of individuals in extreme poverty (234 million).  This aligns precisely with the data presented.  The statement does not misrepresent or distort the data.

Statement 2 accurately describes the World Bank's analysis of a "polycrisis" impacting global poverty reduction and the global prosperity gap.  The report's key theme – the convergence of slow economic growth, increased fragility, climate risks, and heightened uncertainty – is correctly summarized. There's no exaggeration or misinterpretation of the report's findings.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct and reflect the core findings of the referenced reports.


**2. With reference to India's National Multidimensional Poverty Index (NMPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMPI, introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, utilizes data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and includes 12 indicators, retaining the 10 original indicators of the global MPI model and adding two new indicators: Maternal Health and Bank Account.
2. The NMPI value is calculated by adding the headcount ratio (H), which represents the percentage of the population below the poverty line, and the intensity of poverty (A), which indicates the average proportion of deprivations experienced by multidimensionally poor individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The NMPI was indeed introduced in 2021 by NITI Aayog, and it does use NFHS data.  It also correctly identifies the inclusion of 12 indicators, with the addition of Maternal Health and Bank Account to the original 10 global MPI indicators.  The statement's accuracy is high.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMPI value is *not* calculated by adding the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A).  Instead, it is calculated by *multiplying* these two components.  This is a crucial distinction, as addition would yield a vastly different result and misrepresent the index's methodology.  The error in the calculation method renders the statement incorrect.


**3. With reference to the concept of "Middle Income Trap," consider the following statements:**

1.  The World Bank defines Middle Income Countries (MICs) as economies with a per capita Gross National Income (GNI) between US$1,135 and US$13,846, and India, with a per capita GDP of approximately $2,500, is classified as a MIC.
2. The World Bank's World Development Report 2024 suggests that countries aiming for high-income status should adopt a "3i strategy" – Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation – and that "Creative Destruction" is crucial for transitioning between these three stages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The World Bank's classification of MICs and India's approximate per capita GDP are accurately reflected in the statement.  There is no distortion or misrepresentation of the World Bank's categorization.  The figures are consistent with the information provided.

Statement 2 is also correct. The World Bank's recommendation of the "3i strategy" (Investment, Infusion of global technologies, Innovation) and the role of "Creative Destruction" in facilitating the transition between these stages are accurately summarized. The statement reflects the core message of the World Bank report without misrepresentation.


**4. With reference to India's e-commerce market, consider the following statements:**

1.  Invest India projects India's e-commerce market to reach $325 billion by 2030, while in 2022, the sector was valued at $70 billion, representing approximately 7% of India's total retail market.
2.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India to encourage competition and boost the organized retail sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the projected growth of India's e-commerce market as per Invest India's forecast and the sector's size in 2022,  representing its share in the total retail market. The figures are precisely stated as given in the source material.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India. This is to protect the unorganized retail sector, which is considered less capable of competing with large, foreign-backed e-commerce entities offering significant discounts.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning household savings in India:**

1. Household savings are categorized into financial savings (currency, deposits, life insurance funds, etc.) and physical savings (physical assets, gold, and silver), and a decline in financial savings poses challenges for the banking sector's liquidity and credit risk management.
2.  In India, the household sector typically invests more than its savings, leading to a deficit that needs to be covered by borrowing from other sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the categorization of household savings in India and the challenges posed by a decline in financial savings to the banking sector's liquidity and credit risk management.  The statement correctly identifies the components of financial and physical savings and their impact on the banking system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Indian household sector typically generates *surplus* savings relative to its investments, lending the excess to other sectors. This directly contradicts the statement's claim of a savings deficit requiring external borrowing.  The statement misrepresents the relationship between household savings and investment in India.



**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMSY aims to enhance fish production and productivity by addressing critical gaps in technology, post-harvest infrastructure, and value chain strengthening.
2.  The Rangeen Machhli app, providing multilingual information on ornamental fish, is a key component of PMMSY.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is an umbrella scheme designed to comprehensively improve India's fisheries sector.  Its objectives explicitly include boosting fish production and productivity by tackling shortcomings in technology, post-harvest infrastructure, and the overall value chain.  This involves investments in infrastructure, technology upgrades, and market access improvements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMMSY aims to promote the ornamental fish industry, the Rangeen Machhli app is not directly a part of PMMSY.  Although both initiatives focus on the fisheries sector, the app's development is a separate endeavor, even if it aligns with the broader goals of PMMSY.  The app's creation falls under a different scheme or initiative, making it inaccurate to link it directly to PMMSY as a key component.


**2. With reference to Recirculatory Aquaculture System (RAS) and Biofloc technology, consider the following statements:**

1. RAS is an environmentally friendly technique that relies on in-situ microorganism production to enhance water quality.
2. Biofloc technology involves the recycling and reuse of water in fish culture tanks after removing suspended particles and metabolites using mechanical and biological filters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  RAS (Recirculatory Aquaculture System) is not primarily based on in-situ microorganism production. While beneficial microorganisms might be part of the system's overall biology, the core principle of RAS is water recirculation and filtration to minimize water usage and waste discharge.  Biofloc, on the other hand, is the technique that focuses on in-situ microorganism production for improved water quality.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The description of water recycling and filtration using mechanical and biological filters is actually a characteristic of RAS, not Biofloc.  Biofloc aims at creating a beneficial bacterial environment within the aquaculture system, improving water quality and reducing the need for external inputs, not through elaborate filtration systems.  Biofloc relies on the natural processes of microbial growth and nutrient cycling.



**3. With reference to India's seaweed farming initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) has set a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.
2.  Offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region has been initiated by the National Institute of Ocean Technology – Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025 is associated with the PM Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), not the FIDF (Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund).  While FIDF contributes to overall fisheries infrastructure development, the specific seaweed production target is under the PMMSY.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Institute of Ocean Technology – Atal Centre for Ocean Science and Technology for Islands (NIOT-ACOSTI) has indeed undertaken initiatives to establish offshore seaweed cultivation in the Andaman region. This demonstrates a proactive approach to exploring the potential of seaweed farming in India's coastal areas.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the pilot project involves 11 PACS across 11 states, implying that more than one PACS might be involved in each state.  The statement presents an inaccurate count of participating entities.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of the "World's Largest Grain Storage Plan" clearly indicates its aim of enhancing grain storage capacity within the cooperative sector, directly improving post-harvest management of agricultural produce.  This aligns with the overall objective of reducing post-harvest losses and improving efficiency.

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership exclusively funded by Finland, aimed at assisting least-developed countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade for sustainable development.
2. The EIF is supported by international organizations such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and its trust fund is managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Finland is mentioned as a supporting country, the passage describes the EIF as a *multilateral* partnership, indicating involvement from multiple countries and not solely Finland.  The funding sources are likely diverse.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the EIF is supported by international organizations like the World Bank and WTO, and its trust fund is managed by UNOPS. This accurately reflects the framework's multi-stakeholder involvement and management structure.


**20. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) and operates under the same funding mechanism as its predecessor.
2. The primary objective of the DBN is to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas, ensuring affordable access to telecommunication services in remote and rural regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DBN replaced the USOF but operates under a different funding mechanism.  The text mentions that USOF used a Universal Access Levy, while the DBN's funding mechanism is not explicitly detailed, indicating a difference in approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the DBN's purpose is to fund telecom schemes in underserved areas to ensure affordable access to telecom services in remote and rural regions. This directly reflects the fund's primary objective.


**21. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence (NCoE) for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE for AVGC-XR will be established as a non-profit organization under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, with a mandate to promote and regulate the AVGC industry in India.
2. The establishment of the NCoE for AVGC-XR is a follow-up to the budget announcements of 2022-23, which proposed the creation of an AVGC task force to foster growth in the sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that the NCoE will be set up as a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, not as a non-profit organization under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.  This highlights a difference in the legal framework for establishing the center.  Furthermore, the passage doesn't mention a regulatory mandate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly links the creation of the NCoE to the budget announcements of 2022-23, which proposed the formation of an AVGC task force.  This indicates a clear progression and follow-up action to support the AVGC sector.


**22. With reference to NITI Aayog's report on multidimensional poverty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report indicates a significant increase in multidimensional poverty in India between 2013-14 and 2022-23, particularly in poorer states.
2.  The report suggests that India is on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 1.2 (reducing multidimensional poverty by at least half) well before 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report actually shows a *decrease* in the poverty headcount ratio from 29.17% (2013-14) to 11.28% (2022-23).  The statement misrepresents the key finding of the report.  The faster decline in poorer states indicates a reduction in disparities, not an increase in poverty.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that India is on track to achieve SDG Target 1.2 ahead of 2030, based on the findings of the NITI Aayog report. This accurately reflects the report's assessment of progress in poverty reduction.


**23. With reference to the "middle-income trap" and the World Bank's World Development Report 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The World Bank report suggests that India is immune to the risk of falling into the middle-income trap due to its robust economic growth and diversification.
2.  The report proposes a "3i strategy" – Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation – as a pathway for countries to escape the middle-income trap.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the World Bank report indicates that various countries, *including India*, run the risk of falling into the middle-income trap.  The statement presents an inaccurate interpretation of the report's findings.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly outlines the "3i strategy" (Investment, Infusion of global technologies, and Innovation) as a suggested pathway for countries aiming for high-income status to avoid the middle-income trap.  This accurately reflects the report's recommendations.

1. The Preston Curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between income inequality and life expectancy, showing a consistent positive correlation between the two.
2.  The Preston Curve was first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975 to analyze the relationship between income and health outcomes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage does not describe the Preston Curve as showing a *consistent positive* correlation between income inequality and life expectancy.  The provided information doesn't give a detailed description of the curve's nature.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the Preston Curve was first proposed by Samuel H. Preston in 1975 to analyze the relationship between income and health outcomes.  This accurately reflects the historical context and the creator of the curve.  The precise nature of the relationship is not fully elaborated.


**1. With reference to the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) and its initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the exclusive use of jute packaging for all commodities.
2.  The JCI's Jute I-CARE project focuses solely on the mechanization of jute farming, neglecting other aspects of jute cultivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the compulsory use of jute packaging for certain commodities, not exclusively for all.  The extent of compulsory use varies and is subject to government policy and amendments.  The act aims to promote jute production and utilization but doesn't enforce its use across all packaging needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The JCI's Jute I-CARE (Jute: Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise) project is a multifaceted initiative. While mechanization of jute farming is a key component, it also addresses advanced retting techniques using microbial consortia.  This holistic approach aims to improve both the cultivation and post-harvest processes, aiming for increased efficiency and quality.  The project is not solely focused on mechanization.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS):**

1. NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, exclusively focuses on assessing the access of rural populations to credit facilities.
2. The NAFINDEX, derived from NAFIS data, is a comprehensive measure of financial inclusion encompassing various financial services beyond just loans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NAFIS does assess access to credit, its scope is broader.  It provides a comprehensive overview of rural populations' livelihoods and their level of financial inclusion. This includes not only loans but also insurance, pension schemes, and other financial services crucial for economic well-being.  Therefore, the statement misrepresents the survey's objectives.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NAFINDEX, derived from the data collected through NAFIS, indeed serves as a key metric for measuring financial inclusion in rural areas.  It considers a wide range of financial services, providing a more holistic picture than focusing solely on credit access.  This aligns perfectly with NAFIS's broader goal of assessing the overall financial inclusion status of the rural population.


**3. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS, registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, are directly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  One of the primary functions of District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) is to provide financial support to PACS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and are administered by the concerned State Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS). They are not directly regulated by the RBI, unlike some other cooperative banking institutions.  This distinction in regulatory oversight is crucial for understanding the governance structure of the rural credit system.

Statement 2 is correct. DCCBs play a vital role in supporting PACS financially. They act as a crucial link in the cooperative credit structure, providing funds that PACS then utilize to extend credit to farmers and other rural borrowers. This refinancing mechanism is essential for ensuring the smooth functioning of PACS and their ability to meet credit demands.


**4. Consider the following statements about the regulation of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India:**

1.  The RBI classifies all collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000 as microfinance loans.
2. The Malegam Committee Report, commissioned by the RBI, recommended a regulatory framework specifically for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating as MFIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals/groups belonging to low-income households, with an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000.  The statement incorrectly reverses this crucial income threshold, potentially leading to misinterpretations of microfinance loan eligibility criteria.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) was indeed tasked with examining the regulatory needs of the microfinance sector. Its recommendations led to the development of a framework specifically designed to regulate NBFC-MFIs, addressing concerns about their operations and ensuring responsible lending practices. This is a landmark event in the history of microfinance regulation in India.


**5. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are primarily responsible for acquiring Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and subsequently liquidating them.
2. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) recommended the establishment of ARCs, drawing inspiration from similar asset management companies globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ARCs do acquire NPAs from banks and financial institutions, their role is not limited to mere liquidation.  ARCs are also tasked with resolving these stressed assets, which can involve various strategies, including restructuring loans and reviving businesses to recover the value of the assets.  Liquidation is one option, but not the sole objective.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Narasimham Committee II (1998) played a pivotal role in advocating for the establishment of ARCs in India.  The committee recognized the need for specialized institutions to handle stressed assets, improving the health of the banking sector and drawing parallels with successful models used internationally.  This recommendation laid the foundation for the subsequent establishment of ARCs and their regulatory framework.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016:**

1. The IBC mandates the completion of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) within 180 days, with no possibility of extension.
2.  The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) serves as the adjudicating authority for CIRP and liquidation of corporate persons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the IBC aims for a time-bound resolution process, the 180-day timeframe for CIRP is not absolute.  The code allows for extensions, up to a maximum of 330 days, under specific circumstances.  This flexibility is crucial to allow for thorough assessment and resolution of complex insolvency cases.  The statement oversimplifies the timeline.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NCLT is indeed the designated adjudicating authority for handling CIRP and liquidation proceedings for corporate entities, including corporate debtors and their personal guarantors.  This centralized mechanism ensures consistent application of the IBC and efficient management of insolvency cases.  The statement accurately reflects the NCLT's role within the IBC framework.


**7. With reference to the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPIRP is applicable to all corporate entities facing insolvency regardless of the default amount.
2. PPIRP involves a hybrid process with an informal pre-initiation phase and a formal post-initiation stage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PPIRP is specifically designed for stressed corporate Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).  It's not applicable to all corporate entities facing insolvency.  There's a threshold for eligibility based on the default amount, which needs to be at least ₹10 lakh.  The statement incorrectly generalizes the applicability of PPIRP.

Statement 2 is correct. PPIRP is indeed a hybrid approach. It combines an informal pre-initiation phase, where the debtor works with creditors to develop a resolution plan, followed by a formal post-initiation stage where the plan is submitted to the NCLT for approval. This hybrid nature balances efficiency with due process. The statement accurately describes the two-stage process.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the  Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS):**

1.  The PLFS, launched in 2017, primarily focuses on estimating employment indicators, with limited attention to unemployment data.
2. The PLFS data provides insights into the overall structure of the Indian labor market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PLFS, while providing robust employment data, also aims to estimate key unemployment indicators. It provides comprehensive data on both employment and unemployment, offering a holistic picture of the labor market dynamics.  The statement understates the scope of the survey.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PLFS provides crucial data on various aspects of the Indian labor market.  It allows for analysis of participation rates, unemployment rates across different demographics, types of employment, and other critical indicators, offering insights into the overall structure and challenges of the Indian labor market.  The statement correctly highlights the survey's contribution to labor market understanding.


**9. With reference to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), consider the following statements:**

1.  ICAR, established in 1929, was initially known as the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research.
2. ICAR is currently an autonomous body under the Ministry of Rural Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ICAR's origin traces back to the Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, established in 1929.  This historical context is important to understand its evolution and role in agricultural research in India. The statement accurately reflects this historical fact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ICAR is an autonomous organization under the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), which falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This distinction is crucial for understanding its funding, policy directives, and overall organizational structure.  The statement incorrectly assigns it to the wrong ministry.


**10.  Consider the following statements about  Wilful Default under the Indian banking system:**

1. A wilful default occurs when a borrower fails to repay a loan, irrespective of their capacity to pay.
2.  Lenders are required to form an Identification Committee to determine cases of wilful default.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A wilful default is not simply a failure to repay; it involves a deliberate intent not to repay, even when the borrower possesses the capacity to do so.  The existence of the capacity to pay is a crucial element in determining whether a default is wilful or not.  The statement omits this crucial aspect of the definition.

Statement 2 is correct.  Lenders are indeed mandated to establish an Identification Committee to meticulously examine the evidence and determine whether a default qualifies as wilful. This committee's role is vital in ensuring fair and accurate assessment of defaults, preventing misclassification, and upholding transparency in the process.  The statement accurately reflects the regulatory requirement.



**1. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMGS NMP is solely focused on developing railway infrastructure across India, aiming to enhance connectivity and efficiency.
2.  The PMGS NMP utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, integrating data from various ministries and leveraging satellite imagery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) is a comprehensive initiative that integrates infrastructure development across seven key sectors: Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure.  It's not solely focused on railways. The plan aims to create a holistic and efficient infrastructure network, promoting synergy and reducing redundancy across different modes of transport.

Statement 2 is correct. The PMGS NMP is indeed built upon a Digital Master Planning tool developed by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG-N). This tool uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform, integrates data from various ministries (including information on ongoing and future projects like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and UDAN), and incorporates ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps. This integrated approach allows for efficient planning and coordination of infrastructure projects.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India's infrastructure development, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report praised India's PPP regulatory landscape as one of the most efficient and transparent globally, leading to significant private investment.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects, ensuring adherence to national standards and regulations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the World Bank does release reports analyzing PPP regulatory landscapes,  it doesn't necessarily present India's as the most efficient and transparent globally.  The report provides a comparative analysis across numerous economies, and India's ranking and specific assessment would vary depending on the report's criteria and year of publication.  The statement oversimplifies the complexity of India's PPP regulatory environment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC) in India evaluates central sector PPP projects, not just state-level ones. State governments have their own appraisal mechanisms for PPP projects within their jurisdictions.  The PPPAC's role is focused on projects under the purview of the central government.


**3.  With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1. PMMSY primarily focuses on promoting inland aquaculture, neglecting the development of marine fisheries infrastructure.
2.  The PMMSY aims to achieve a target of 1 million tons of seaweed production annually by 2025, a significant component of its overall objectives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) is a comprehensive scheme aiming to address critical gaps across the entire fish production and productivity value chain, encompassing both marine and inland fisheries.  It supports infrastructure development, technology adoption, and post-harvest management in both sectors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PMMSY does indeed have a stated target of achieving 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025. This reflects the government's recognition of the economic and environmental potential of seaweed cultivation and its integration into the broader aquaculture sector.


**4. With reference to India's silk production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's silk production is dominated by Mulberry silk, with other varieties like Eri, Tasar, and Muga contributing only a minor share of the total output.
2. Andhra Pradesh consistently ranks as the highest contributor to India's overall silk production, exceeding the contribution of all other states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mulberry silk is a significant component of India's silk production, the country also produces substantial quantities of Eri, Tasar, and Muga silk.  These varieties represent a diverse range of silk production methods and contribute significantly to the overall output and regional economies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Karnataka is typically the largest contributor to India's total silk production, not Andhra Pradesh. While Andhra Pradesh is a significant producer, Karnataka's share usually exceeds that of Andhra Pradesh and other states.


**5. With reference to the initiatives undertaken to promote millet cultivation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Millet-based products (PLISMBP) primarily focuses on providing subsidies to farmers for millet cultivation, irrespective of their production levels.
2. The "Initiative for Nutritional Security through Intensive Millets Promotion" aims to improve millet production and post-harvest technologies, primarily through a centralized, top-down approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Millet-based products (PLISMBP) is an incentive scheme, but it's not simply a subsidy for cultivation.  It's designed to incentivize the processing and value addition of millet products, aiming to boost the market for millet-based food items and create more profitable opportunities for farmers.  The incentive is linked to production levels and value addition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Initiative for Nutritional Security through Intensive Millets Promotion" employs a cluster approach,  which is a decentralized approach.  This strategy recognizes the diverse agro-climatic conditions across India and works with local communities and stakeholders to tailor interventions to specific regional needs and contexts.  It’s not a centralized, top-down approach.


**6. With reference to the SPICED scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The SPICED scheme is primarily focused on increasing the export of spices like turmeric and chili, with minimal emphasis on cardamom production.
2. The implementation of the SPICED scheme is scheduled to conclude by the end of the 14th Finance Commission's term.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the SPICED (Sustainability in spice sector through Progressive, Innovative and Collaborative interventions for Export Development) scheme aims to boost spice exports, it specifically targets cardamom production as a major component. The scheme aims to increase the area under cardamom cultivation and improve productivity, particularly for small and large cardamom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SPICED scheme's implementation is planned during the remaining term of the *15th* Finance Commission (from 2023-24 to 2025-26), not the 14th.


**7. With reference to Inheritance Tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Inheritance tax is currently levied in India on the total value of a deceased person's estate, similar to estate tax systems in other countries.
2. The abolition of estate duty in India in 1985 was primarily due to its low tax rates, which did not generate sufficient revenue for the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India currently does *not* have an inheritance tax.  The statement incorrectly asserts its current existence.  The text clearly states that there is no inheritance tax currently levied in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The abolition of estate duty in 1985 was primarily due to its *high* tax rates (up to 85%), which made it unpopular and led to significant tax evasion.  The statement reverses the reason for its abolition.


**8. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across multiple dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation; India's GII ranking has consistently improved over the last decade.
2. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) reflects the loss in HDI due to inequality; India's IHDI rank is consistently higher than its overall HDI rank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The GII does indeed measure gender inequalities across those dimensions. While the statement about consistent improvement over the *last decade* might need nuanced interpretation depending on the specific years compared (the provided text only mentions a jump in ranking between 2021 and 2022), the core description of the GII is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IHDI rank is *always lower* than the HDI rank for any country.  The IHDI adjusts the HDI to account for inequalities, resulting in a lower value and thus a lower ranking. The statement misrepresents the relationship between the HDI and IHDI.


**9. With reference to the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 MPI report indicates that the number of people living in acute multidimensional poverty globally has decreased significantly compared to previous years.
2.  India consistently ranks among the top five countries globally with the largest number of people in extreme poverty, according to the MPI reports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that 1.1 billion people (approximately 18%) live in acute multidimensional poverty across 112 countries.  The statement incorrectly suggests a decrease in the number of people in poverty.  The text doesn't provide comparative data to previous years.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 MPI report shows India having the largest number of people in extreme poverty (234 million),  placing it at the top in terms of absolute numbers. While the exact ranking among the "top five" might vary slightly depending on the year and methodology,  India consistently has a very high number of people in extreme poverty according to MPI data.


**10. With reference to Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS are primarily government-owned institutions, operating under strict regulations set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2.  PACS are required to have a minimum of two hundred members and net owned funds of ten lakh rupees or more to operate legally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) are member-owned cooperative institutions, not government-owned. They operate under regulations set by various state and central government bodies, but they are not directly owned or managed by the government. The RBI's role is primarily regulatory in the financial aspects of their operations.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that PACS require a minimum of two hundred members and net owned funds of ten lakh rupees or more to function legally.  These are key criteria for their establishment and continued operation.


**11. With reference to the ISI mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is a voluntary certification, allowing manufacturers to choose whether or not to obtain it for their products.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for issuing Quality Control Orders (QCOs) that make the ISI mark mandatory for certain products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act and serve as grassroots-level institutions for short-term cooperative credit, they receive funds primarily from DCCBs. However,  crucially, they are *not* regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  This is a key distinction.

Statement 2 is correct.  The modernization and expansion of PACS are indeed vital for boosting rural financial inclusion.  They are essential for providing credit and other financial services at the village level, despite facing challenges in their financial health and operational efficiency.  Improving their functioning is critical for effective rural credit delivery.


**7. With reference to the  National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) and asset monetisation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP, launched in the Union Budget 2021-22, aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, primarily focusing on brownfield infrastructure assets across sectors like roads, railways, power, oil & gas pipelines, and telecom, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), and utilizes the Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF)  to enhance the attractiveness of projects for private investors.
2. Asset monetisation involves the transfer of ownership of government-owned assets to private entities in exchange for upfront payments, governed by concession agreements designed to ensure balanced risk-sharing between the public and private sectors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The NMP was indeed launched in Union Budget 2021-22 with the stated goal of generating investment through the monetisation of government assets. It targets brownfield infrastructure assets across various sectors, aiming for ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years. The VGF scheme is used to improve project viability and attract private investment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Asset monetisation does *not* necessarily involve the transfer of *ownership*. It typically involves long-term lease or license agreements, allowing the government to retain some ownership while generating revenue from the asset's utilization.  Concession agreements are used to manage risk-sharing, but outright ownership transfer is not the defining characteristic of asset monetisation under the NMP.


**8. With reference to Nidhi Companies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Nidhi companies are non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) that primarily accept deposits from and lend to their members, operating on a mutual benefit basis, and are strictly regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  A key criterion for establishing a Nidhi company is to have at least two hundred members and net owned funds exceeding ten lakh rupees, thereby ensuring a certain level of financial stability and enabling them to function effectively as mutual benefit societies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nidhi companies are indeed NBFCs that accept deposits from and lend to members, they are *not* strictly regulated by the RBI. Their primary regulation comes from the Companies Act, 2013, not the RBI.

Statement 2 is correct.  The minimum membership requirement of two hundred members and net owned funds exceeding ten lakh rupees are indeed key criteria for establishing a Nidhi company. These criteria are designed to ensure a degree of financial stability and to prevent the formation of smaller, potentially less stable, entities.


**9. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark and its significance, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark, developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), is mandatory for all products sold in India, ensuring product quality and safety, and the BIS also oversees the Hallmark and Eco Mark schemes.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly explains the process by which the BIS makes the ISI mark mandatory for certain products under Scheme I, using QCOs.  The statement accurately reflects the legal and regulatory framework.


**7. With reference to  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000 are considered microfinance loans.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides loans to Microfinance Institutions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The definition of microfinance loans in the text explicitly states that the annual income limit is *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  This subtle change in wording creates a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises through various channels, including commercial banks and NBFCs.  It does not exclusively cater to MFIs.  The statement wrongly restricts the beneficiaries of PMMY.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately reflects that the Vijay Kelkar Committee's 2012 recommendation led to the NMP's launch in the 2021-22 Union Budget.  This accurately reflects the timeline and key actors involved.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly mentions the 13 sectors and the approximate 83% contribution of the top five sectors (Roads, Railways, Power, Oil & Gas pipelines, and Telecom) to the NMP pipeline. This statement directly mirrors the information provided.


**9. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  A Non-Performing Asset (NPA) is a loan or advance that is overdue for more than 180 days.
2.  The Financial Stability Report (FSR) is prepared by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and assesses the overall health of the Indian banking sector, including NPA levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text defines an NPA as a loan overdue for more than 90 days, not 180 days.  The alteration of the timeframe is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the FSR does assess NPA levels, the text states that it is based on the assessment of a Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), not solely the RBI. The statement incorrectly attributes the report's authorship solely to the RBI, oversimplifying the process.


**10. With reference to the  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI measures the combined performance of eight core industries, which constitute more than 50% of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2. Petroleum Refinery Products have the lowest weight in the ICI, followed by Electricity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the eight core industries constitute 40.27% of the IIP weight, not more than 50%. The exaggeration of the percentage is a deliberate attempt to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that Petroleum Refinery Products have the *highest* weight (28.04%), followed by Electricity (19.85%). The statement reverses the order of weights to create confusion.


**1. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are financial institutions that primarily purchase Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions to facilitate balance sheet cleanup.  They are mandated to resolve these assets within a timeframe of 10 years from acquisition.
2. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) recommended the establishment of ARCs, modeled after similar asset management companies globally, and the SARFAESI Act of 2002 formalized their registration and regulation under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While ARCs do purchase NPAs from banks to improve their balance sheets, the stipulated resolution timeframe is 8 years, not 10 years, from the acquisition of financial assets.  The  accurate resolution period is crucial for understanding the operational constraints and efficiency goals of ARCs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) indeed proposed the establishment of ARCs, drawing inspiration from global models of asset management companies.  Subsequently, the SARFAESI Act of 2002 provided the legal framework for their registration and regulation under the RBI's purview. This sequence of events highlights the policy evolution and regulatory implementation concerning ARCs in India.  The accurate identification of the committee and act is vital for comprehending the regulatory landscape of ARCs.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the accurate timeframe for asset resolution by ARCs and the role of the Narasimham Committee II and the SARFAESI Act.  A thorough understanding of the timeline and the regulatory framework is essential for a complete understanding of the functioning of ARCs in the Indian financial system.


**2. With reference to the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP), consider the following statements:**

1.  PPIRP, introduced as an amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in 2020, offers a streamlined insolvency resolution mechanism exclusively for large corporate debtors with defaults exceeding ₹1 crore.
2. The PPIRP process, characterized by a hybrid approach combining informal pre-initiation and formal post-initiation phases, must be completed within 180 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. First, PPIRP was introduced in 2021, not 2020, as an amendment to the IBC. Second, it's designed for stressed corporate MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises), not large corporate debtors, and the default threshold is ₹10 lakh, not ₹1 crore.  The precise year of introduction and the target debtor segment are key aspects differentiating PPIRP from other insolvency resolution mechanisms.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While PPIRP employs a hybrid process, the mandated completion period is 120 days, not 180 days. The stipulated timeframe is a critical factor in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the PPIRP framework.

Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the year of introduction, the target debtor group, the default threshold, and the completion timeline.  Understanding these details is crucial for grasping the nuances of PPIRP and its role in resolving insolvency issues among MSMEs in India.


**3. With reference to the RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs), consider the following statements:**

1.  To be eligible for recognition, an SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, with a substantial net worth and a diverse shareholder base representing the sector.
2. The governance framework mandates that at least one-third of the SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent members, and the SRO must fully comply with all RBI directives and guidelines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's framework requires SROs to be *not-for-profit* companies registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, not for-profit entities. The "not-for-profit" nature is a fundamental aspect of their structure and aligns with their objective of promoting sector-specific compliance and best practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's framework explicitly mandates that at least one-third of the SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must comprise independent members.  This provision ensures robust governance and minimizes conflicts of interest.  Furthermore, full compliance with all RBI regulations and guidelines is a non-negotiable requirement for SRO recognition.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they mischaracterize the eligibility criteria for SRO recognition under the RBI's framework.  The for-profit/not-for-profit distinction and the independent director requirement are crucial aspects of the framework's design.  Understanding these characteristics is essential for comprehending the regulatory oversight of SROs in the Indian financial sector.


**4.  With reference to the RBI's revised NPA Provision Norms for Co-operative Banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  These norms apply to all categories of co-operative banks, including Urban, State, and Central co-operative banks, irrespective of their size or financial health.
2.  Co-operative banks are required to charge provisions for Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) as an expense against their profit and loss account, following the Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms, before allocating any net profits to the BDDR.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The revised NPA provision norms apply to all Urban, State, and Central co-operative banks.  The comprehensive application of these norms ensures consistent standards across all categories of co-operative banks.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The norms mandate that co-operative banks must first charge provisions for BDDR as an expense against their profit and loss account, in accordance with IRACP norms, before allocating any net profits to the BDDR. This sequential process ensures that potential losses are adequately accounted for before profit distribution.

Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the key features of the revised NPA provision norms for co-operative banks.  Understanding these provisions is crucial for assessing the financial health and regulatory compliance of these institutions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope and application of the revised norms.


**5. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework, effective from April 1, 2024, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) and applies to all UCBs except those already under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are the primary parameters for monitoring UCBs under the PCA framework; a UCB is placed under PCA if it breaches the risk thresholds in any of these parameters for two consecutive quarters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework's effective date is April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  The accurate effective date is a crucial detail for understanding the timeline of regulatory changes.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  A UCB is placed under PCA if it breaches risk thresholds for four consecutive quarters, not two. The number of consecutive quarters is a significant factor in determining the severity of the action taken.

Therefore, both statements contain errors regarding the effective date and the number of consecutive quarters for triggering PCA action.  Understanding these details is vital for assessing the regulatory framework governing UCBs in India.


**6. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC, registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), operates as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).
2.  The establishment of a UO for India's UCB sector was initially recommended by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das in 2006, with a refined model proposed by a subsequent working group led by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2009.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  The distinction between Type I and Type II NBFCs is significant in terms of regulatory requirements and operational scope.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The need for a UO was first highlighted by the Viswanathan Committee in 2006, and the model was refined by the Das Committee in 2009.  The correct sequence of these committees is essential for understanding the timeline of policy development.

Both statements contain factual errors regarding the type of NBFC and the chronological order of the committees that shaped the policy.  Understanding these details is crucial for comprehending the regulatory and operational aspects of NUCFDC and its role in supporting UCBs.


**7. With reference to Wilful Defaulters, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's directions on the treatment of wilful defaulters apply only to those with outstanding amounts exceeding ₹50 lakh.
2. The RBI's directions on wilful defaulters are based solely on the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The threshold for wilful defaulters, as per RBI directions, is ₹25 lakh and above, not ₹50 lakh. The accurate threshold is critical for identifying and addressing instances of wilful default.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RBI's directions on wilful defaulters draw upon multiple Acts, including the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005.  The multi-faceted legal basis underscores the comprehensive nature of the regulatory framework.

Both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the threshold amount and the legal basis for the RBI's directions.  Understanding these details is necessary for a complete grasp of the regulatory approach to wilful defaults in the Indian banking system.


**8. With reference to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), consider the following statements:**

1. Appeals against DRT decisions are exclusively filed with the Supreme Court.
2. The DRT system was established to expedite the recovery of debts owed to financial institutions, but it lacks the authority to adjudicate disputes involving non-financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against DRT decisions are first filed with the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), and further appeals can be made to the Supreme Court within 45 days. The two-tiered appellate process is a crucial aspect of the DRT system.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the DRT system primarily aims to speed up debt recovery for financial institutions, it *does* have the jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving certain non-financial institutions as well, depending on the nature of the debt and related regulations.  The scope of DRT's jurisdiction is an important aspect of its functioning.

Both statements misrepresent the appellate process and the scope of the DRT's jurisdiction.  A clear understanding of these aspects is crucial for evaluating the efficacy and reach of the DRT system in India.


**9. With reference to the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMP is a government initiative aimed at generating investment by monetizing existing government assets, with a target of ₹8 lakh crore over five years (FY22 to FY26).
2.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for the implementation of the NMP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target amount for the NMP is ₹6 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), not ₹8 lakh crore over five years.  The precise figures are crucial for assessing the scale and ambition of the NMP.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit plays a significant role, the implementation of the NMP involves multiple government agencies and departments.  The collaborative nature of implementation is an important aspect of the NMP's structure.

Both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the target amount and the responsible entities.  These details are essential for understanding the complexities and challenges of implementing the NMP.


**10. With reference to the Geographical Indications Act, 1999, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act guarantees individual rights over traditional knowledge related to geographical indications.
2.  The Act provides a mechanism for registering and protecting geographical indications, thus granting collective rights to producers associated with specific regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, guarantees *collective*, not individual, rights over traditional knowledge associated with specific geographical regions. The collective nature of the rights is a defining characteristic of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does indeed provide a legal framework for registering and protecting geographical indications, thereby granting collective rights to producers associated with those specific regions.  This protection is crucial for safeguarding traditional products and their associated knowledge.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of the rights granted under the Geographical Indications Act.  A clear understanding of the collective nature of these rights is vital for interpreting the Act's provisions.


**1. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST), consider the following statements:**

1. GST is a direct tax levied on the supply of goods and services, and it subsumed all forms of excise duty.
2. The GST Council, a constitutional body established under Article 279A, is responsible for setting tax rates and making policy decisions related to GST.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GST is an *indirect* tax, not a direct tax. While GST did subsume *many* types of excise duty, it did not subsume all of them. Excise duty continues to apply to petroleum products and liquor.  The statement incorrectly claims complete subsumption.

Statement 2 is correct. The GST Council, established under Article 279A of the Constitution through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016, is indeed responsible for setting tax rates and making policy decisions related to GST.  Its composition, decision-making process (three-fourths majority with a weighted voting system favoring states), and role in recommending policies to the Centre and states are all accurately reflected in the provided text.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS):**

1. IDS refers to a situation where the GST rate paid on sales exceeds the GST rate paid on purchases of input goods.
2.  IDS primarily benefits domestic industries by lowering input costs and enhancing their competitiveness in the export market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDS is characterized by import duties (or, in the context of GST, the GST rates) on input goods being *higher* than those on finished goods, not the other way around as stated. The statement reverses the relationship between input and output tax rates.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IDS actually *harms* domestic industries.  Higher taxes on inputs make products more expensive, hindering competitiveness in both domestic and export markets.  The statement misrepresents the impact of IDS on domestic industries.  The resulting Input Tax Credit (ITC) creates working capital issues, not benefits.


**3. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) and indexation benefits, consider the following statements:**

1. The recent amendment to LTCG tax provisions on immovable properties reinstated indexation benefits for all properties, regardless of acquisition date.
2. The grandfather clause in the amendment ensures that properties acquired before a specified cut-off date retain the benefit of indexation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendment did *not* reinstate indexation benefits for *all* properties.  It continued the abolishment of indexation benefits announced in Budget 2024-25.  The statement misrepresents the core change introduced by the amendment.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendment included a grandfather clause, protecting properties acquired before July 23, 2024, from the abolishment of indexation benefits. This clause provides a transitional measure to mitigate the impact of the change on existing property owners.


**4. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC).
2. NaBFID's primary objective is to promote short-term, recourse-based infrastructure financing in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI, and is classified as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI), not an NBFC. The statement incorrectly identifies the regulatory body and the type of financial institution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing, not short-term, recourse-based financing.  The statement misrepresents the duration and risk profile of the financing NaBFID is intended to provide.


**5. With reference to e-commerce in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model to encourage competition and lower prices for consumers.
2. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to reduce the dominance of large e-commerce platforms by creating a more decentralized and inclusive network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based e-commerce model in India. This restriction is intended to protect the domestic unorganized retail sector. The statement incorrectly states the FDI policy regarding inventory-based e-commerce.

Statement 2 is correct. ONDC's primary aim is to democratize digital commerce by creating an open network that promotes inclusivity and reduces the dominance of large platforms.  The statement accurately reflects ONDC's objective and approach.


**6.  Consider the following statements about the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT):**

1. The CBDT is responsible for the administration of indirect tax laws in India.
2. The CBDT functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBDT administers *direct* tax laws (income tax), not indirect tax laws.  The statement incorrectly assigns the responsibility for indirect tax administration to the CBDT.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBDT operates under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance. This accurately reflects the CBDT's organizational placement within the government structure.


**7. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) and the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  DTAAs primarily aim to increase the tax burden on foreign investors to maximize government revenue.
2. The Principal Purpose Test (PPT), incorporated into amended DTAAs, aims to prevent the abuse of treaties for tax evasion and avoidance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. DTAAs aim to *avoid* double taxation, thereby *reducing* the tax burden on foreign investors and promoting cross-border investment. The statement misrepresents the fundamental purpose of DTAAs.

Statement 2 is correct. The PPT is a key element of BEPS, designed to prevent the misuse of DTAAs for tax evasion and avoidance by focusing on the principal purpose of a transaction. The statement accurately describes the role of the PPT.


**8.  Consider the following statements about the Equalisation Levy:**

1. The equalisation levy was introduced in India to tax only resident e-commerce companies.
2. The equalisation levy was initially applied at a rate of 2% on online advertisements and related payments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The equalisation levy was introduced to tax *non-resident* e-commerce companies, not resident ones.  The statement incorrectly identifies the target of the equalisation levy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The initial rate of the equalisation levy was 6%, not 2%, and it applied to online advertisements and related payments. The statement incorrectly states the initial rate and scope of the levy.


**9. With reference to the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), consider the following statements:**

1. ONDC is a for-profit organization established under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
2. ONDC employs a platform-centric model, focusing on a single, centralized platform for all transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ONDC is a Section 8 company, meaning it's a *non-profit* organization. It's also under the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The statement incorrectly identifies ONDC's organizational structure and its parent ministry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ONDC uses a *network-centric* model, not a platform-centric model. This network-centric approach involves connecting multiple platforms and participants, not centralizing all transactions on a single platform. The statement misrepresents ONDC's core design principle.


**10. With reference to the Competition Commission of India (CCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCI was established in 2002 under the Competition Act, 2009.
2. The CCI's functions include protecting consumer interests and ensuring freedom of trade in Indian markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCI was established in 2009, not 2002, under the Competition Act, 2002. The statement incorrectly states the year of establishment and the relevant act.

Statement 2 is correct. The CCI's functions explicitly include protecting consumer interests and ensuring freedom of trade, along with preventing anti-competitive practices and promoting competition.  The statement accurately reflects the CCI's mandate.


**11. With reference to the challenges in India's coal sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's high dependence on coking coal imports is mainly due to the high gross calorific value (GCV) of domestically produced coking coal.
2. Coal India Limited (CIL) contributes less than 50% of India's total coal production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's high dependence on coking coal imports is due to the *low* GCV of domestically produced coking coal, which has high ash and sulfur content, unlike imported coal.  The statement incorrectly links import dependence to high GCV of domestic coal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CIL contributes *over* 80% of India's indigenous coal production, not less than 50%. The statement significantly underestimates CIL's share of domestic coal production.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK):**

1. RRSK is a fund established to enhance railway safety infrastructure, with a five-year allocation of ₹50,000 crore.
2. RRSK primarily focuses on the deployment of Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. RRSK is indeed a fund for upgrading railway safety infrastructure, but the total allocation is ₹1 lakh crore (100,000 crore), not ₹50,000 crore.  The statement underestimates the fund's total allocation but accurately reflects its primary purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the deployment of LHB coaches is a part of broader railway safety initiatives, RRSK's scope is much wider than just LHB coach deployment.  It encompasses a range of safety infrastructure upgrades.  The statement incorrectly limits RRSK's focus.


**13. With reference to the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to reduce private sector participation in infrastructure development.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP aims to *increase* private sector participation by monetizing existing government assets to generate investment. The statement incorrectly portrays the NMP's objective.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee is responsible for evaluating central sector PPP projects.  The statement accurately describes the committee's role.


**14. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP) is available only for large corporate entities with defaults exceeding ₹1 crore.
2. Appeals against decisions of the Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) are filed before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PPIRP is available for corporate MSMEs with defaults of at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹1 crore. The statement misrepresents the threshold for initiating PPIRP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against DRT decisions are filed before the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), not the NCLAT.  The statement incorrectly identifies the appellate authority for DRT decisions.  NCLAT deals with appeals related to the corporate insolvency resolution process under IBC.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1. ARCs are primarily responsible for acquiring Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions to improve their balance sheets.
2.  The establishment of ARCs was initially proposed by the Chelliah Committee in 1991.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ARCs play a crucial role in acquiring NPAs from banks and financial institutions, helping them clean up their balance sheets and focus on core lending activities.  The statement accurately reflects the primary function of ARCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The establishment of ARCs was proposed by the Narasimham Committee II (1998), not the Chelliah Committee in 1991. The statement incorrectly attributes the proposal to the wrong committee.  The Chelliah Committee focused on tax reforms.


**1. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Economic Affairs' Private Investment Unit is solely responsible for all aspects of PPP project implementation, including operational oversight.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee exclusively evaluates PPP projects undertaken by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs handles policy-level matters concerning PPPs, it does not manage every aspect of project implementation. Operational aspects are handled by various agencies and ministries involved in the specific projects.  The statement oversimplifies the complex multi-layered governance structure involved in PPP projects.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee specifically evaluates central sector PPP projects. This is a crucial function to ensure the viability and adherence to set standards in infrastructure development.  This committee plays a critical role in the financial appraisal of these large-scale projects.  Other entities may also review PPP projects at the state or local level.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India:**

1. InvITs can only issue subordinate units to sponsors upon the acquisition of any infrastructure project, regardless of whether it's publicly or privately placed.
2.  InvITs are exclusively designed for large-scale infrastructure projects, excluding smaller-scale initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amended SEBI regulations allow for the issuance of subordinate units by *privately placed* InvITs only to sponsors upon the acquisition of an infrastructure project. Publicly placed InvITs do not have this same restriction. This nuanced distinction is crucial and highlights the regulatory complexities in the InvIT framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While InvITs are commonly associated with large-scale infrastructure,  the definition does not exclude smaller-scale projects. The 'low ticket size' feature of InvITs suggests that they are designed to be accessible to a wider range of investors, making smaller-scale participation plausible.


**3. With reference to the functioning of Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are mandated to resolve all acquired financial assets within a maximum of 5 years from the date of acquisition.
2. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) explicitly recommended the establishment of ARCs modeled after asset management companies globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs are required to resolve assets within a maximum of 8 years, not 5 years, of acquisition. This timeframe reflects the complexities involved in resolving Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and the need for a longer period for effective restructuring and recovery.  A shorter timeframe would likely be unrealistic and hinder effective resolution.

Statement 2 is correct. The Narasimham Committee II (1998) did indeed propose the establishment of ARCs, drawing parallels to the global models of asset management companies. This recommendation laid the groundwork for the legal framework that governs ARCs in India. The creation of ARCs was a key policy response to the growing problem of NPAs in the Indian banking sector.


**4. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) oversight of Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit entity registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be recognized by RBI.
2.  The RBI's Omnibus Framework mandates that at least one-third of an SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI framework specifies that an SRO should be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.  This reflects the intention for SROs to focus on sector regulation and improvement rather than profit maximization. Profit motive could create inherent conflicts of interest.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognizing SROs clearly states that at least one-third of the members in the Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent. This ensures that the SRO's governance is not dominated by vested interests within the sector it regulates.  This independent oversight is critical to maintaining impartiality and effectiveness.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs):**

1. The new PCA framework, effective from April 1, 2024, replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2.  The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, including those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new PCA framework is effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  The one-year difference is significant in terms of the implementation timeline and allows for preparation and transition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PCA framework explicitly excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID). This exception reflects a differentiated approach to supervision based on the specific circumstances and financial health of individual UCBs.  The AID designation indicates a higher level of regulatory intervention already in place.


**6. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  The need for an umbrella organization for India's UCB sector was first proposed by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri V.S. Das.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFCs accept public funds or have a customer interface, which accurately reflects NUCFDC's operations.  The distinction between Type I and Type II NBFCs is crucial for regulatory purposes and understanding the level of risk involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The need for an umbrella organization was first highlighted by an RBI Working Group chaired by Shri N.S. Viswanathan in 2006.  The model was further refined by a working group led by Shri V.S. Das in 2009, but the initial proposal came from the Viswanathan committee.  Attributing the initial proposal to the wrong individual would be a significant factual error.


**7. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The incentive framework for PSL prioritizes districts with high credit flow to promote equitable distribution of credit.
2.  The Gadgil Committee (1969) and the Ghosh Committee (1982) were significantly involved in the initial conceptualization of PSL.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The revised PSL norms establish an incentive framework for districts with *lower* credit flow, not higher. The aim is to address credit gaps in underserved areas and ensure more equitable access to credit.  Prioritizing high credit flow areas would exacerbate existing inequalities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil Committee (1969) and the Ghosh Committee (1982) played key roles in shaping the early stages of PSL policy in India. Their recommendations influenced the framework and objectives of PSL, highlighting the evolution of policy over time to address changing economic needs.  These committees are important historical milestones in the development of India's financial inclusion policies.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism in India:**

1.  MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure accurate price determination based on market trends.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all crops without any external review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MSP is announced at the *beginning* of the sowing season, not at the end of the harvesting season.  This timing is crucial to provide farmers with price certainty before they begin planting their crops.  Announcing it after harvest would render the MSP mechanism largely ineffective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP recommends MSPs, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. The CCEA considers various factors, including the CACP's recommendations, before making the final determination.  This multi-step process reflects the political and economic weight of MSP decisions.


**9. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Agricultural exports in India registered a significant increase in 2023-24, surpassing the target set by the 2018 policy.
2. The 2018 Agricultural Export Policy aimed to achieve agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Agricultural exports in India saw an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the ambitious target. This shortfall highlights the challenges in achieving export targets in the agricultural sector, despite policy efforts.  External factors like global market conditions can significantly impact export performance.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, did indeed aim for agricultural exports of $60 billion by 2022.  The ambitious target reflected the government's commitment to boosting agricultural exports and enhancing the sector's contribution to the economy. While the target was not met, the policy remains a significant policy initiative.


**10. With reference to the Indian Railways' safety initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) is a 10-year fund allocated for upgrading critical railway safety infrastructure.
2.  The KAVACH system is an imported Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RRSK is a 5-year fund, not a 10-year fund, allocated for upgrading railway safety infrastructure. The shorter duration reflects a specific timeframe for achieving planned improvements.  The five-year period was chosen to allow for focused implementation and measurable outcomes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The KAVACH system is an *indigenous* Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, not an imported one. The development and deployment of KAVACH represent significant strides in enhancing railway safety through domestic technological innovation.  The emphasis on indigenous technology is crucial for self-reliance and reducing dependence on foreign technologies.


**11. With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1.  NaBFID was established as a Development Financial Institution (DFI) under the Companies Act, 2013.
2.  NaBFID's primary objective is to solely focus on short-term infrastructure financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, not the Companies Act, 2013.  The establishment of a separate act highlights the specialized nature of NaBFID's mandate and its distinct role in infrastructure financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term* non-recourse infrastructure financing, not short-term financing.  Long-term financing is crucial for large-scale infrastructure projects, which typically have long gestation periods and require sustained financial support.  Short-term focus would be inappropriate for the projects NaBFID is designed to support.


**12. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IBC code mandates that the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) must be completed within a maximum of 270 days.
2.  Information Utilities (IUs) play a crucial role in collecting and disseminating financial information of companies undergoing insolvency resolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IBC mandates the completion of CIRP within 180 days, extendable to a maximum of 330 days, not 270 days.  The 180-day timeframe is a key feature designed to ensure timely resolution of insolvency cases.  The possibility of extension is built into the system to accommodate exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct.  Information Utilities (IUs) are indeed vital for collecting, authenticating, and disseminating financial information during insolvency resolution.  This information is crucial for creditors, potential investors, and the insolvency professionals involved in the process.  The role of IUs ensures transparency and efficient decision-making.



**1. With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seaweed cultivation contributes significantly to India's GDP, exceeding 5% of the total national output.
2.  The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the fishing and aquaculture sector, which includes seaweed farming, contributes 1.5% to India's GDP, not more than 5%.  This is a significant contribution, but it is considerably less than the figure presented in the statement. The statement inflates the contribution to mislead the candidate.  The candidate needs to recall the precise percentage mentioned in the text.

Statement 2 is correct. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana explicitly aims for 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025. This is a clearly stated target within the provided context and requires direct recall of information.


**2. With reference to India's Silk Production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's silk production accounts for approximately 60% of the global output, making it the world's largest producer.
2.  Karnataka is the leading state in silk production, contributing more than 40% of India's total output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India is the *second* largest silk producer globally, contributing 42% to the world's total production in 2023, not 60%. The statement manipulates the ranking and percentage to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karnataka is a major contributor to India's silk production, the text indicates it contributes around 32%, not more than 40%. The statement alters the percentage to confuse the examinee.  The candidate must accurately recall the state's contribution percentage.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMSY solely focuses on enhancing marine fish production and does not address inland fisheries.
2.  The scheme involves the establishment of Integrated Aquaparks to consolidate various fisheries activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of PMMSY explicitly mentions addressing critical gaps in *both* marine and inland fisheries production, productivity, technology, and value chain strengthening. The statement wrongly restricts the scheme's scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text specifically mentions the introduction of Integrated Aquaparks under PMMSY to facilitate various fisheries activities in a single location. This requires direct recall of the scheme's components.


**4. With reference to India's Agricultural Exports, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's agricultural exports exceeded the target of $60 billion by 2022, as set by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.
2.  Rice is the highest-value agricultural export from India, accounting for more than 25% of the total export value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that agricultural exports in 2023-24 registered an 8% decline and fell short of the $60 billion target set by the 2018 policy.  The statement presents the opposite outcome to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice is a significant export, the text indicates it constitutes 21% of total exports, not more than 25%.  The candidate needs to precisely recall the percentage.  The statement slightly alters the percentage to create doubt.


**5. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  MSP is applicable to all agricultural crops produced in India, ensuring a minimum price for farmers.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP without any further review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that MSP covers 22 crops,  not all agricultural crops produced in India. The statement expands the scope of MSP to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While CACP recommends MSP, the text clearly states that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (chaired by the Prime Minister) takes the final decision. The statement omits this crucial step in the MSP determination process.


**6.  With reference to India's Deep Sea Mining, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  Polymetallic nodules are the only type of mineral resource that can be mined from the deep sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957. The statement incorrectly expands the applicability of the rules.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text lists several types of resources that can be mined from the deep sea, including polymetallic nodules, seafloor massive sulphides, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts. The statement wrongly limits the types of deep-sea mineral resources.


**7. With reference to the Steel Sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption exceeds the global average.
2.  The Indian steel sector's reliance on imported coking coal is a major challenge due to high costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India's per capita finished steel consumption (97.7 kg in 2023-24) is significantly lower than the world average (219.3 kg). The statement reverses the reality to test the candidate's knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly highlights India's substantial reliance on costly imported coking coal from Australia as a major challenge for the steel sector. This is a direct recall question.


**8. With reference to India's Port Sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vadhavan Port, once operational, will be India's second-largest container port.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that NISA celebrated its 100th anniversary, not its 50th anniversary. The statement alters the anniversary year.

Statement 2 is correct.  While NISA's activities are broader, the text explicitly connects NISA to the development of Integrated Aquaparks and the adoption of advanced technologies such as RAS and Biofloc. This is a direct recall question testing the candidate's knowledge of the institute's activities.


**1. With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) under the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1. The AoA mandates the complete elimination of all non-tariff barriers (NTBs) such as quotas and variable levies, regardless of the specific circumstances of member countries.
2. The AoA's provisions on domestic support differentiate between various types of subsidies based on their trade-distorting potential, categorizing them into different "boxes."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the AoA promotes tariffication—the conversion of NTBs into tariffs—it doesn't mandate the complete elimination of all NTBs.  The process of tariffication allows for the eventual reduction of tariffs over time, but it recognizes that immediate complete elimination might be impractical or unduly harmful for some countries.  The pace and manner of tariffication are negotiated and vary among WTO members depending on their level of development and specific agricultural sectors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AoA's provisions on domestic support are a cornerstone of the agreement.  It categorizes subsidies into different "boxes" (Amber, Blue, Green) based on their trade-distorting potential. Amber Box subsidies are considered the most trade-distorting and are subject to reduction commitments. Blue Box subsidies are less trade-distorting and are permitted subject to certain conditions. Green Box subsidies are deemed to have minimal trade-distorting effects and are generally exempt from reduction commitments. This categorization reflects the complexity of agricultural subsidies and the need for a nuanced approach to address their impact on international trade.  The existence of these different boxes demonstrates the careful consideration given to the varying nature and impact of domestic support measures.


**2. With reference to the OECD Global Minimum Tax, consider the following statements:**

1. The OECD Global Minimum Tax aims to prevent tax avoidance by multinational corporations (MNCs) by ensuring a minimum tax rate of 15% on their global profits, regardless of where they are headquartered.
2.  The Global Minimum Tax is solely based on a unilateral initiative by the OECD, with no collaboration or involvement from other international organizations or governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The OECD Global Minimum Tax, based on the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules, aims to establish a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on the profits of large multinational enterprises (MNEs).  The goal is to prevent profit shifting—the practice of MNCs shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions to reduce their overall tax burden. By setting a global minimum, the initiative seeks to create a more level playing field and ensure that MNCs contribute their fair share of taxes in all jurisdictions where they operate.  This is a key aspect of international tax cooperation and aims for a fairer and more stable global tax system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the OECD played a leading role in developing the Global Minimum Tax, it's not a solely unilateral initiative.  The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is a collaborative effort involving 147 countries and jurisdictions. This framework provides the platform for international cooperation and consensus-building on tax matters, including the Global Minimum Tax.  The participation of numerous governments and international organizations demonstrates the multilateral nature of this initiative and its importance in addressing global tax challenges.  The involvement of the G20 underscores the political and economic significance given to this issue at the highest levels of international governance.


**3. With reference to the UN Global Tax Treaty, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Global Tax Treaty aims to establish a universally binding legal framework that will override all existing bilateral tax treaties (DTAAs) between countries.
2. Developing countries overwhelmingly supported the terms of reference for the UN Global Tax Convention, while developed nations largely opposed it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN Global Tax Treaty, as envisioned, aims to create a multilateral framework for international tax cooperation. However, it is not intended to automatically override existing bilateral tax treaties (DTAAs).  The treaty would likely work in conjunction with existing DTAAs, providing a supplementary framework for resolving disputes and promoting greater consistency and fairness in international taxation.  The complexities of existing bilateral agreements and national tax systems would necessitate a phased and coordinated approach to integration with a new multilateral treaty.  The goal is to enhance, not replace, the existing system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The news reports accurately reflect a significant divergence in viewpoints regarding the UN Global Tax Convention. Developing countries, including India, generally favored the terms of reference, viewing the treaty as a potential mechanism to address the imbalances in the current international tax system and gain a greater share of tax revenue from multinational corporations.  Developed nations, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the potential impact on their national sovereignty and competitiveness, leading to their opposition to the terms of reference.  This reflects a broader power dynamic in global governance and the ongoing debate over equitable tax policies in an increasingly interconnected world.


**4. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package), consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Package aims to completely eliminate all forms of fisheries subsidies, regardless of their environmental impact.
2. The agreement was adopted unanimously by all WTO member countries at the 12th Ministerial Conference.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies (Geneva Package) targets *harmful* fisheries subsidies—those that contribute to overfishing and depletion of fish stocks.  It doesn't aim to eliminate all subsidies.  Some subsidies might have positive impacts, such as those promoting sustainable fishing practices or supporting small-scale fishers. The agreement focuses on identifying and addressing the subsidies that cause the most environmental damage and undermine the sustainability of fisheries resources.  This targeted approach reflects the need to balance economic interests with environmental protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Geneva Package was adopted at the 12th Ministerial Conference, it wasn't unanimously approved by all member countries.  The negotiations were complex and involved significant disagreements among member states regarding the scope and implementation of the agreement.  The final agreement represents a compromise that reflects the diverse interests and priorities of WTO members.  The fact that it wasn't unanimously adopted highlights the challenges of reaching consensus on global environmental and trade issues.


**5. With reference to India's offshore mineral resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons, found within India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
2. The rules mandate the use of the United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC) and Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) Template for exploration and feasibility studies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, specifically exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals listed in Part B of the First Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. This exclusion reflects the separate regulatory frameworks and complexities associated with the extraction of oil and gas resources compared to other minerals.  The rules focus on a specific set of offshore minerals, excluding those already covered under different legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. The rules indeed mandate the use of a modified version of the UNFC and CRIRSCO Template for exploration stages and feasibility studies. This requirement ensures a standardized and internationally accepted approach to exploration and resource assessment.  Adopting these internationally recognized standards enhances transparency, consistency, and comparability of data related to offshore mineral resources.  It also facilitates international collaboration and investment in the sector by aligning Indian practices with global best practices.  This is crucial for ensuring the sustainable and responsible development of these valuable resources.


**6. With reference to the Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "peace clause" agreed upon at the WTO's 9th Ministerial Conference (MC9) provides a permanent solution to the concerns raised by developed countries regarding PSH programs in developing countries.
2.  Developing countries advocate for an increase in the de minimis limit for agricultural subsidies, while most developed countries argue that PSH programs distort markets and should be subject to stricter regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "peace clause" adopted at the WTO's MC9 in Bali was an *interim* solution, not a permanent one. It provided temporary protection to developing countries' PSH programs from WTO dispute settlement actions.  However, it did not resolve the underlying concerns about the trade-distorting effects of PSH, leaving the issue open for future negotiations and potential challenges.  The temporary nature of the peace clause highlights the ongoing tension and need for a lasting solution to address the concerns of both developed and developing countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  There's a significant divergence of views on PSH between developed and developing countries. Developing countries argue that PSH programs are essential for food security and protecting their vulnerable populations.  They advocate for higher de minimis limits (the permissible level of subsidies) to allow for larger-scale procurement and distribution of food grains.  Developed countries, on the other hand, often express concerns that PSH programs can distort markets and provide an unfair advantage to domestic producers.  They generally advocate for stricter regulations and limitations on PSH, reflecting their concerns about fair trade practices and market competitiveness.  This global divide underscores the complexities of balancing food security concerns with international trade rules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FASAL does use space and agro-meteorological data, its primary focus is on providing *early forecasts* of crop output, not real-time updates on crop conditions.  The technologies mentioned (AI and remote sensing) are not the central features of FASAL's methodology. Statement 2 is correct. ADeX does hold the specified datasets and is designed to be a platform for farmer services.  While the integration with ICCC is not explicitly stated in all sources, the platforms are designed to complement each other.   Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the functions of FASAL and ADeX or fail to correctly identify the accurate statement.


**6. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSPs for 24 crops, including 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 4 commercial crops,  and the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
2.  The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal Central procuring agency for all 22 MSP-covered crops,  ensuring procurement at the announced MSPs across all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CACP recommends MSPs for 22 crops (14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops), not 24. The statement incorrectly inflates the number of crops covered.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While FCI is a major procuring agency, it is not the nodal agency for *all* 22 MSP-covered crops.  Other agencies also play a significant role in procurement at the state level.  The statement overstates FCI's role.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the number of crops covered under MSP and the role of FCI in procurement.


**7. With reference to India’s Agriculture Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's ambitious target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022, set by the Agriculture Export Policy 2018,  was achieved in 2021-22, despite facing challenges from global trade dynamics.
2. The decline in agricultural exports in 2023-24, as reported recently, was primarily due to a decrease in global demand for Indian agricultural products, unrelated to domestic policy challenges.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target of $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 was *not* achieved.  The recent news reports indicate a shortfall.  The statement misrepresents the outcome of the policy.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While decreased global demand might have played a role in the decline of agricultural exports in 2023-24, the decline was also influenced by various domestic policy challenges and logistical issues.  The statement oversimplifies the causes of the decline.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the achievement of the export target and the reasons for the recent decline.


**8. With reference to the  livestock sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The average annual productivity of cattle in India (1777 kg/animal/year in 2019-20) is lower than the world average (2699 kg/animal/year in 2019-20),  and this productivity gap is primarily due to the prevalence of animal diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).
2. The National Animal Disease Control Program (NADCP) aims to control and eradicate FMD and Brucellosis,  and utilizes advanced technologies like the 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip' for comprehensive disease surveillance and tracking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided data accurately reflects the productivity gap between Indian cattle and the world average. While multiple factors contribute to this gap, the prevalence of diseases like FMD is a significant contributor.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NADCP aims to control and eradicate FMD and Brucellosis, but the 'Gau Chip' and 'Mahish Chip' are not directly used for comprehensive disease surveillance and tracking within the NADCP framework. These chips are used for other purposes related to animal identification and traceability.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent either the productivity data or the role of the NADCP and the genomic chips.


**9. With reference to the World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in the Cooperative Sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The plan, implemented by the Ministry of Cooperation (MoC), aims to establish decentralized storage facilities at the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS) level,  and these facilities will primarily focus on modernizing existing grain storage infrastructure.
2. PACS can avail subsidies and interest subvention benefits for constructing godowns/storage facilities and setting up other agri-infrastructure,  and the plan involves the convergence of various schemes, including the Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MoC's plan aims to establish decentralized storage facilities at the PACS level, aiming to increase storage capacity at the grassroots level. While modernization is a component, the primary aim is to increase storage capacity, not solely modernization. Statement 2 is also correct. PACS can avail subsidies and interest subvention benefits under this initiative, and the plan indeed involves convergence with other schemes, including the Warehousing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2007.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements regarding the grain storage plan.


**10. With reference to the Food Corporation of India (FCI), consider the following statements:**

1. Established in 1965 under the Food Corporation Act 1964,  FCI's primary role is to manage buffer stocks of wheat and rice,  and it does not directly participate in the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) Domestic.
2.  States can purchase rice from FCI under the OMSS Domestic without participating in the e-auction from August 1, 2024,  and this direct purchase option aims to stabilize market prices and curb inflation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FCI's primary role is managing buffer stocks, it *does* participate in the OMSS Domestic, albeit through e-auctions, primarily.  The statement incorrectly excludes FCI's role in the OMSS.  Statement 2 is correct. The new provision allows states to directly purchase rice from FCI under OMSS Domestic without e-auctions, starting August 1, 2024,  with the aim of controlling market prices and curbing inflation. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent FCI's role in the OMSS or fail to correctly identify the accurate statement.


**11. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monitors UCBs primarily on the basis of their capital adequacy ratio,  and places them under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) if they breach the prescribed thresholds for non-performing assets (NPAs).
2.  A UCB can exit PCA and have restrictions withdrawn if it demonstrates consistent improvement in its financial health, as evidenced by four successive quarterly financial statements without any breaches in risk thresholds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI monitors UCBs focusing on capital, asset quality, and profitability.  PCA is implemented if risk thresholds are breached, and NPA levels are a key factor in this assessment.  Statement 2 is also correct.  A UCB can exit PCA if it shows consistent financial improvement, as demonstrated by four consecutive quarters without breaching any risk thresholds.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly represent the RBI's monitoring of UCBs or the conditions for exiting PCA.


**12. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises,  and these loans are categorized into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with no provision for higher loan amounts.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulatory body for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) operating in India,  and the RBI's Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a framework for regulating Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) operating as MFIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PMMY provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises,  the statement incorrectly states that there is no provision for higher loan amounts. The 2024 Union Budget increased the limit to ₹20 lakh under the 'Tarun Plus' category.  Statement 2 is correct. The RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs in India, and the Malegam Committee did recommend a regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the PMMY loan amounts or the RBI's role in regulating MFIs.


**1. With reference to India's logistics infrastructure, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharatmala Pariyojana aims to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases, with a significant portion allocated to Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs).
2.  The Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) and PM GatiShakti are primarily focused on improving road transport efficiency, while neglecting other modes of transportation like waterways and railways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Bharatmala Pariyojana does indeed aim to construct approximately 65,000 km of National Highways in two phases. While DFCs are a separate initiative under the National Rail Plan 2030, the improved road network indirectly supports freight movement and complements DFCs.  The statement accurately reflects the scale of the Bharatmala project and its connection to national highway development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While LEEP and PM GatiShakti aim to improve overall logistics efficiency, they are not limited to road transport. PM GatiShakti, in particular, adopts a multimodal approach, integrating railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure.  The statement misrepresents the scope of these programs by falsely suggesting a narrow focus on road transport alone.  The programs actively seek to optimize the entire logistics ecosystem, not just roads.


**2. With reference to the Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) was established in 2006 under the Indian Companies Act of 1956, primarily to oversee the planning and development of DFCs, but not their operation and maintenance.
2. The DFCs are solely intended to increase the share of rail freight traffic to 45% by 2030, without any consideration for improving overall logistics efficiency or reducing transportation costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  DFCCIL's mandate extends beyond planning and development. It is responsible for the entire lifecycle of DFCs, including construction, maintenance, and operation. The statement inaccurately limits DFCCIL's role, omitting its crucial operational responsibilities.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While increasing the share of rail freight traffic to 45% by 2030 is a key objective of the DFCs,  they also contribute to broader logistics efficiency and cost reduction by providing dedicated, high-capacity freight corridors.  The statement falsely presents a narrow and isolated objective, ignoring the wider benefits of DFCs in the national logistics network.  The improved efficiency translates directly into cost savings for businesses.


**3. With reference to India's port sector, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vadhvan Port, once operational, will be the 13th major port in India, surpassing all existing ports in terms of container handling capacity and depth.
2. The development of Vadhvan Port is primarily driven by the need to alleviate congestion at existing major ports and enhance India's overall port capacity to handle increasing cargo volumes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Vadhvan Port will be the 13th major port in India, the claim that it will surpass *all* existing ports in terms of container handling capacity and depth is an overstatement and currently unsubstantiated. While it's planned to be a large container port and a deep-water port,  its ultimate capacity relative to all other existing major ports remains to be seen and needs further information to verify.

Statement 2 is correct.  The development of new ports like Vadhvan is directly related to the need to increase India's port capacity.  Existing ports often face congestion, limiting their efficiency.  New ports, with modern infrastructure, help alleviate this pressure and improve overall cargo handling capacity.  The statement accurately reflects the strategic rationale behind the Vadhvan Port project within the broader context of India's growing trade and maritime sector.


**4.  With reference to the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RELOS agreement with Russia, once finalized, will solely focus on facilitating the exchange of military supplies and equipment between the two countries during wartime.
2.  India currently has similar RELOS agreements only with countries in the Indo-Pacific region, reflecting its strategic focus on this area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RELOS agreement encompasses both wartime and peacetime scenarios. It aims to facilitate access to logistics and support facilities, including fuel, rations, and spare parts, not only during conflicts but also for joint exercises, humanitarian assistance, and other collaborative missions. The statement incorrectly restricts the agreement's scope to wartime situations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While India has RELOS agreements with Indo-Pacific partners like Japan, Australia, and Singapore, it also has such agreements with countries outside this region, such as the US, France, and South Korea. The statement's assertion about the geographical limitation of India's RELOS agreements is false.  India's RELOS partnerships reflect a broader strategic outlook beyond the Indo-Pacific region.


**5. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a multilateral partnership exclusively focused on assisting Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in utilizing trade as a tool for economic growth and poverty reduction, excluding any other form of development assistance.
2. The EIF's operational structure is managed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) with financial support solely from the 51 partner countries involved in the framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the EIF's primary focus is on assisting LDCs in using trade for growth and poverty reduction, it doesn't exclude other forms of development assistance.  The statement falsely suggests an exclusive focus on trade-related support, overlooking the potential for broader development collaboration.  The EIF works in conjunction with other development initiatives.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While UNOPS manages the EIF Trust Fund, the EIF receives support not only from the 51 partner countries but also from international organizations like the World Bank and WTO.  The statement inaccurately restricts the funding sources to only the partner countries, ignoring the contribution of other key international players. The EIF benefits from a diverse range of financial and technical contributions.


**6. With reference to the Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN), consider the following statements:**

1. The DBN, established under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, completely replaced the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), eliminating all previous funding mechanisms for telecom schemes in underserved areas.
2.  The DBN solely relies on funding from the Department of Telecommunication (DoT) and does not accept contributions from other government bodies or private entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DBN replaced the USOF, but it doesn't imply the elimination of all previous funding mechanisms.  The statement presents an overly simplistic view of the transition, ignoring the possibility of other funding streams or transitional arrangements that may have existed alongside the USOF before the DBN's establishment.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The DBN's funding sources are not limited to the DoT. While the DoT plays a significant role, the DBN can potentially receive funding from other government sources or even private entities depending on the specific schemes and initiatives.  The statement incorrectly restricts the funding sources to a single entity, overlooking the potential for broader financial participation.


**7. With reference to the National Centre of Excellence for Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality (AVGC-XR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCoE for AVGC-XR was established as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013, with the primary objective of regulating the AVGC industry in India.
2. The Indian Institute for Immersive Creators (IIIC) is the final and officially registered name of the NCoE for AVGC-XR,  functioning independently of any government oversight.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NCoE for AVGC-XR is indeed a Section 8 company under the Companies Act, 2013, its primary objective is not industry regulation. It focuses on skill development, fostering innovation, and promoting growth within the AVGC-XR sector.  The statement misrepresents the NCoE's role and function.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the NCoE was provisionally named IIIC, this may not be the final registered name.  Furthermore, the NCoE is not entirely independent of government oversight,  given its importance in a sector with potential government interest.  The statement presents an inaccurate representation of the NCoE’s name and status.


**8. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore, focused solely on streamlining cross-border payments between these two countries.
2. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub conceptualized Project Nexus, with the goal of establishing a new global standard for cross-border payments, replacing existing systems like UPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a multilateral initiative, not limited to India and Singapore.  It involves several ASEAN countries alongside India, aiming for broader regional interoperability.  The statement falsely restricts the scope of Project Nexus to a bilateral arrangement.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the BIS Innovation Hub conceptualized Project Nexus, its goal is not to replace existing systems like UPI but to interconnect domestic instant payment systems (IPS) to enable seamless cross-border transactions.  The statement misrepresents the objective of Project Nexus as a replacement rather than an integration of existing systems.  The aim is to complement and enhance, not replace, existing infrastructure.


**9. With reference to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations, consider the following statements:**

1. The SEBI (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024 primarily aim to restrict foreign investment in Indian venture capital undertakings, protecting domestic businesses from foreign competition.
2.  Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) are permitted to invest only in venture capital funds registered with SEBI and are prohibited from directly investing in unlisted Indian companies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amendments to SEBI regulations concerning FVCIs are not intended to restrict foreign investment but rather to streamline and clarify regulations, potentially making it easier for foreign investors to participate in the Indian market. The statement incorrectly portrays the amendments as restrictive measures.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  FVCIs can invest either in SEBI-registered venture capital funds *or* directly in unlisted Indian companies.  The statement falsely presents an either/or condition that doesn't accurately reflect the flexibility provided to FVCIs under SEBI regulations.  The regulations allow for a variety of investment avenues for FVCIs.


**10. With reference to Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, will only apply to UCBs categorized as tier 1, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) primarily functions as a regulatory body, overseeing all aspects of UCB operations and enforcing compliance with the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework applies to tier 2, 3, and 4 UCBs, not just tier 1.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the PCA framework to a specific tier of UCBs.  It also incorrectly states that it replaces the Supervisory Action Framework for *all* UCBs.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While NUCFDC aims to improve regulatory compliance, it primarily functions as an umbrella organization providing support services like liquidity and capital support, technological assistance, and regulatory compliance guidance to UCBs.  It does not directly function as a regulatory body with enforcement powers. The statement misrepresents the NUCFDC's core functions, overstating its regulatory role.  It acts more as a facilitator and support system.


**1. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC) functions as a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) for UCBs and is registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  The RBI's Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, applies to all UCBs except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID) and will replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF), primarily focusing on capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NUCFDC is indeed an umbrella organization for UCBs and is registered with the RBI. However, it's registered as a *Type II* NBFC-ND, not Type I.  Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds and have a direct customer interface, unlike Type I NBFC-NDs.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the regulatory framework and NUCFDC's operational scope.  The statement incorrectly classifies the NUCFDC's NBFC type.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's introduction of the PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, is accurate. This framework aims to enhance the precision and flexibility of addressing the financial health of UCBs. The exclusion of UCBs under AID and the replacement of the SAF are also accurate details. The focus on capital, asset quality, and profitability as key monitoring areas is a core component of the new framework.  The statement accurately reflects the key features of the new RBI framework.


**2. With reference to the National Technical Textiles Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The mission aims to make India the second-largest exporter of technical textiles globally, prioritizing the development of niche segments such as geotextiles and medical textiles.
2.  Government initiatives supporting the mission include the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for textiles, the PM Mega Integrated Textile Regions and Apparel Parks (MITRA) Scheme, and the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), but exclude mandatory usage stipulations for technical textiles by government departments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Technical Textiles Mission aims to elevate India's position in the global technical textiles market, the goal is to become a *global leader*, not simply the second-largest exporter.  The statement misrepresents the ambition of the mission, oversimplifying its objectives.  Focusing on specific niche segments is a part of the strategy, but the primary aim is broader leadership.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The statement accurately lists several government schemes supporting the textile sector's growth, including the PLI scheme, MITRA, and SITP. However, it wrongly states that mandatory usage of technical textiles by central ministries and departments is *excluded*.  In reality, several government departments *have been mandated* to utilize technical textiles, furthering the mission's objectives.  The omission of this crucial detail makes the statement inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICI, released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, includes eight core industries representing over 50% of the weight of items in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP).
2.  Petroleum refinery products hold the highest weight in the ICI, exceeding 30%, followed by electricity, which accounts for approximately 20%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies the ICI as a measure of the combined performance of eight core industries. However, it wrongly attributes the release of the ICI to the National Statistical Office (NSO).  The ICI is actually released by the Office of the Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry. Furthermore, the statement incorrectly states that the eight core industries represent over 50% of the IIP weight; the actual figure is approximately 40%.  These inaccuracies make the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately reflects the weighting of petroleum refinery products and electricity within the ICI. Petroleum refinery products indeed hold the highest weight (28.04%), followed by electricity (19.85%). The statement correctly presents the relative importance of these two sectors within the ICI.


**4. With reference to the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  From the 1980s until economic liberalization, GFCF as a percentage of GDP consistently remained below 10%.
2.  Private investment, as a component of GFCF, experienced a significant decline from 2011-12 onwards, reaching a low point of approximately 20% of GDP in 2020-21 before showing signs of recovery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly asserts that GFCF as a percentage of GDP remained consistently below 10% from the 1980s until economic liberalization.  While it fluctuated around 10%, it did at times exceed that figure. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the historical trend.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately describes the trend of private investment as a component of GFCF in India since 2011-12.  The decline to a low of around 19.6% in 2020-21 and the subsequent recovery are correctly depicted, highlighting a significant economic challenge and subsequent recovery.


**5. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All seven CRAs registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) — Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, INFOMERICS, and Brickwork — are accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2.  SEBI regulations mandate CRAs to publicly disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines for managing conflicts of interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly lists the seven CRAs registered with SEBI. However, it inaccurately claims that all of them are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.  Brickwork Ratings is the exception; while registered with SEBI, it lacks RBI accreditation.  This crucial detail renders the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI's regulations for CRAs rightly mandate the public disclosure of their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policies, and conflict-of-interest management guidelines.  Transparency and accountability are central to these regulations. The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of SEBI's oversight of CRAs.


**6. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  InvITs are exclusively used for investing in large-scale infrastructure projects such as national highways and major port developments, excluding smaller-scale projects.
2.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulations allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only upon the acquisition of infrastructure assets, aiming to bridge valuation gaps between the sponsor and the InvIT.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of InvIT investments to only large-scale infrastructure projects.  While InvITs are commonly used for major projects, they can also be utilized for smaller-scale infrastructure ventures. The statement's restrictive definition of InvIT applicability is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The SEBI's amendment to the InvIT regulations, permitting privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only upon asset acquisition, accurately aims to address valuation discrepancies between sponsors and InvITs.  This measure is designed to improve the efficiency and transparency of InvIT transactions.


**7. With reference to the International Financial Services Centres (IFSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) is an autonomous body established under the IFSC Act, 2019, with its headquarters located in GIFT City, Gujarat.
2. The IFSCA's regulatory purview extends to all financial products, services, and institutions within IFSCs, with the exception of entities specifically regulated by other central agencies like the RBI or SEBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IFSCA is indeed a statutory body established under the IFSC Act, 2019, and is headquartered in GIFT City, Gujarat.  Its role as a unified regulator for IFSCs is accurate. The statement correctly identifies the IFSCA's establishment and location.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the IFSCA has broad regulatory powers, it doesn't exclude entities regulated by other central agencies.  There can be overlapping regulatory frameworks in certain areas, necessitating coordination between the IFSCA and other regulators like the RBI and SEBI. The statement incorrectly portrays the IFSCA's regulatory scope as completely independent of other central agencies.


**8. With reference to Nidhi Companies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nidhi companies are governed by the Nidhi Rules, 2014, issued by the Ministry of Finance and are required to maintain a minimum of 500 members and a net owned fund of at least 20 lakh rupees.
2.  Their primary objective is to encourage thrift and savings amongst their members by accepting deposits and providing loans exclusively to members for their mutual benefit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies the Nidhi Rules, 2014, as the governing regulations for Nidhi companies.  However, it incorrectly states the minimum membership requirement as 500 and the net owned fund requirement as 20 lakh rupees. The correct figures are 200 members and 10 lakh rupees, respectively.  These numerical discrepancies make the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately describes the primary objective of Nidhi companies, which is to promote thrift and savings among their members by accepting deposits and providing loans exclusively within their membership.  This mutual benefit aspect is a core characteristic of Nidhi companies.


**9. With reference to the Indian Standards Institution (ISI) mark, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark is awarded by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) based on a voluntary application process, and its presence on a product guarantees its compliance with all relevant international standards.
2. The central government mandates the ISI mark for several product categories through Quality Control Orders (QCOs) under the BIS Act, 2016, ensuring consumer safety and quality control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ISI mark is indeed awarded by the BIS, it is not based solely on a voluntary application process.  The central government mandates the ISI mark for certain product categories through QCOs.  Furthermore, the ISI mark guarantees compliance with Indian standards, not necessarily all relevant international standards.  The statement misrepresents both the mandatory nature of the mark for certain products and the scope of its certification.

Statement 2 is correct. The central government's power to mandate the ISI mark for specific products through QCOs under the BIS Act, 2016, is accurate.  This mechanism is used to ensure consumer safety and quality control for essential products. The statement correctly outlines the government's role in enforcing the ISI mark's application.


**10. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at streamlining cross-border payments using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
2.  It is built upon the concept of interlinking domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) and is supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), aiming to achieve G20 targets for faster and more transparent cross-border payments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Project Nexus is not a bilateral initiative limited to India and Singapore. It's a *multilateral* initiative involving multiple countries, including several ASEAN nations besides India. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the project's participation.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately describes Project Nexus as an initiative focused on interlinking domestic IPSs to facilitate cross-border payments.  The support from the BIS and the alignment with G20 goals for improved cross-border payment systems are also accurately presented.  The statement correctly captures the project's core features and objectives.



**1. With reference to Project Nexus, consider the following statements:**

1. Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating instant cross-border payments.
2. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is an example of an Instant Payments System (IPS) that could be integrated into Project Nexus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative, involving India and several ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), not just India and Singapore.  Its core purpose is to interconnect domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS) to enable faster cross-border payments.  The focus is on creating a broader network, not a bilateral arrangement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a prime example of an Instant Payments System (IPS).  The question's description of an IPS aligns perfectly with UPI's functionality: facilitating inter-bank fund transfers with near-instantaneous confirmation.  Project Nexus aims to link such systems across international borders, making UPI a likely candidate for integration.  The fact that it's explicitly mentioned as an example in the source material further supports this.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Foreign Venture Capital Investors) (Amendment) Regulations, 2024:**

1. These regulations primarily govern investments made by Indian venture capital funds in foreign companies.
2.  The amendments aim to streamline the process for Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) investing in Indian venture capital undertakings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The regulations focus on *foreign* venture capital investors (FVCIs) investing in *India*, not the other way around.  The amendments relate to FVCIs, which are entities incorporated outside India, making investments in Indian markets.  The regulations aim to clarify and potentially simplify the process for these foreign investors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The news clearly indicates that the 2024 amendment to the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, is designed to modify existing rules governing FVCIs.  This implies a streamlining or improvement of the investment process for these foreign entities within the Indian context. The core objective is to adjust the regulatory framework for FVCIs operating within India.


**3. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1. NUCFDC is a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) primarily focused on providing microloans to rural populations.
2.  One of NUCFDC's key functions is to offer liquidity and capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NUCFDC is indeed an NBFC, its focus is on *urban* cooperative banks (UCBs), not rural microfinance.  The description explicitly states that it's an umbrella organization for UCBs, indicating a focus on urban cooperative banking rather than rural microfinance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text clearly outlines that one of NUCFDC's major functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to UCBs.  This is a core element of its role as an umbrella organization aimed at strengthening the financial health and stability of these banks.  The mention of raising capital (targeting Rs. 300 crore) further reinforces this function.


**4. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework will be implemented retroactively, applying to all UCBs regardless of their financial health.
2. Capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability are key parameters for monitoring under the PCA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework is explicitly stated to be effective from April 1, 2025, meaning it's *prospective*, not retroactive. It will not apply retrospectively to past actions or financial situations of UCBs.  The implementation date indicates a forward-looking approach to regulating UCBs.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions that capital, asset quality, and profitability will be the key areas for monitoring under the new PCA framework.  These are standard indicators of a bank's financial health, and the framework clearly uses them to assess and intervene in the case of struggling UCBs.


**5. With reference to the eligibility criteria for Small Finance Banks (SFBs) to transition into Universal Banks, consider the following statements:**

1. SFBs must have been operating for at least 10 years to be eligible for transition.
2.  A minimum net worth of ₹1000 crore is a mandatory requirement for SFBs seeking to become Universal Banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The eligibility criteria specify a minimum of 5 years of satisfactory performance, not 10 years, for SFBs seeking to become Universal Banks. This requirement aims to ensure that the SFBs have a proven track record before expanding their operations.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that SFBs must have a minimum net worth of ₹1000 crore to meet the eligibility requirements for transitioning to Universal Banks. This substantial net worth requirement reflects the increased capital demands associated with offering a broader range of financial services.


**6.  With reference to the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID), consider the following statements:**

1. NaBFID is primarily responsible for providing short-term, recourse-based loans for infrastructure projects.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) acts as the regulatory body for NaBFID.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NaBFID's objective is to support *long-term*, *non-recourse* infrastructure financing.  The emphasis on long-term financing and the non-recourse nature of the loans differentiate it from institutions providing short-term, recourse-based lending.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that NaBFID is regulated and supervised by the RBI as an All India Financial Institution (AIFI) under specific sections of the RBI Act, 1934. This regulatory oversight by the RBI is a key aspect of NaBFID's operations.


**7.  With reference to India's e-commerce market, consider the following statements:**

1.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in the inventory-based model of e-commerce in India.
2. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create a closed, proprietary e-commerce network.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FDI is *not* permitted in the inventory-based model of e-commerce in India to protect the domestic retail sector.  The passage explicitly states this restriction, highlighting the government's policy to safeguard the unorganized retail segment from competition from large foreign players.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ONDC is designed to be an *open source*, *open* network, not a closed or proprietary one. Its aim is to promote greater competition and interoperability within the e-commerce ecosystem, contrasting with closed, proprietary networks.


**8. With reference to India Stack, consider the following statements:**

1. India Stack is a proprietary digital public infrastructure (DPI) developed by a private consortium.
2. The One Future Alliance is an initiative aimed at promoting the adoption of India Stack globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India Stack is a *foundational* digital public infrastructure (DPI) developed by the Indian government, not a private consortium.  It's explicitly described as "India's own foundational DPI," emphasizing its public nature and development within the Indian government's framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the One Future Alliance aims to promote the adoption of DPI globally, it is not specifically focused on India Stack. It seeks broader DPI adoption in low- and middle-income countries, not the exclusive promotion of a specific national platform like India Stack.  The goal is to leverage DPI principles and best practices, not to replicate one specific model.


**9. With reference to the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), consider the following statements:**

1. UPI was launched in 2012 and is managed by a private sector company.
2.  NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) is involved in expanding UPI's reach to international markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UPI was launched in 2016, not 2012, and is managed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a *public* entity, not a private sector company.  The passage clearly states NPCI's establishment and role in operating retail payment systems in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The news explicitly mentions NIPL's partnership with Trinidad and Tobago to develop a UPI-like system, demonstrating its role in internationalizing UPI.  This aligns with the broader objective of expanding UPI's reach beyond India's borders.


**10. With reference to the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), consider the following statements:**

1. TRIPS mandates compulsory licensing only for pharmaceutical products.
2. The TRIPS Agreement is administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing for a broader range of intellectual property, not just pharmaceutical products.  The text explicitly mentions that compulsory licensing is allowed to produce patented products or processes without the patent owner's consent, which applies beyond pharmaceuticals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The TRIPS Agreement is indeed administered and overseen by the World Trade Organization (WTO).  The mention of WTO dispute settlement procedures regarding TRIPS obligations confirms its role in administering the agreement.


**11. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF consistently remained above 25% of GDP in India since economic liberalization.
2. A decline in private investment contributed to a significant drop in GFCF as a percentage of GDP after 2011-12.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GFCF rose significantly to around 27% of GDP in 2007-08, it did not consistently remain above 25% since economic liberalization.  The text clearly points out that private investment, a major component of GFCF, dropped significantly after 2011-12, indicating fluctuations below 25%.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that private investment began to decline after 2011-12, reaching a low of 19.6% of GDP in 2020-21. This decline directly impacted GFCF, as private investment is a crucial component of the overall investment in fixed capital.


**12. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microloans to women-led enterprises.
2.  All collateral-free loans to individuals with an annual income below ₹3,00,000 are considered microfinance loans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While PMMY aims to support micro and small enterprises, it's not exclusively for women-led businesses.  The scheme provides loans to various non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, regardless of gender.

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's definition of microfinance loans, as stated in the passage, accurately reflects the statement.  The definition is clear regarding the income threshold and the absence of collateral as defining characteristics of microfinance loans.


**13. With reference to India's transition from LIBOR, consider the following statements:**

1. The RBI has mandated the exclusive use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a replacement for LIBOR.
2. The Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL) plays a role in developing alternative reference rates (ARRs) for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI is encouraging a transition away from LIBOR, it has not mandated the *exclusive* use of SOFR.  The text indicates that the RBI has established a system of ARRs, allowing banks to choose from a *basket* of rates, including MIFOR (India), rather than mandating a single replacement like SOFR.

Statement 2 is correct. FBIL's role in developing and administering benchmarks relating to money market, government securities, and foreign exchange in India directly relates to the development of ARRs to replace LIBOR.  Its involvement in this process is clearly stated in the passage.


**14. With reference to RBI surplus transfers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI surplus is primarily generated from its investments in government securities.
2. The FY24 surplus transfer to the government was significantly higher than the previous year's transfer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the RBI's income includes returns from investments, the passage indicates that the surplus is primarily generated from the *net interest income*, which is significantly larger than its total expenditure.  The statement misrepresents the primary source of the RBI's surplus.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the FY24 surplus transfer to the government (₹2.11 lakh crore) was more than double the previous year's transfer (₹86,416 crore).  This significant increase is a key aspect of the news.


**15. With reference to Finternet, consider the following statements:**

1. Finternet is a centralized financial system controlled by a single governing body.
2.  A key feature of Finternet is the seamless transfer of financial assets across various platforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Finternet envisions *interconnected* financial ecosystems, not a centralized system. The concept emphasizes decentralization and empowerment of individuals and businesses, contrasting with a centralized, controlled architecture.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of Finternet highlights its ability to enable seamless transfer of financial assets anytime, anywhere, and using any device. This seamless transfer across platforms is a core element of its vision for a more efficient and accessible financial system.


**16. With reference to Perpetual Bonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Perpetual bonds have a fixed maturity date like other bonds.
2.  Investors can recover their principal investment by selling the bond in the secondary market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The defining characteristic of perpetual bonds is the *absence* of a maturity date.  Unlike traditional bonds with fixed maturity periods, perpetual bonds continue indefinitely, offering interest payments but no guaranteed principal repayment at a specific time.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that investors can recover their principal by selling the bond in the secondary market or when the issuer decides to redeem them.  This liquidity feature in the secondary market is a key aspect of perpetual bonds.


**17. With reference to Participatory Notes (P-Notes), consider the following statements:**

1. P-Notes allow foreign investors to invest in the Indian stock market without direct registration with SEBI.
2.  P-Notes are issued by SEBI-registered domestic mutual funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that P-Notes are issued by registered foreign FPIs to overseas investors who wish to invest in India without direct registration with SEBI.  This is a key function and benefit of P-Notes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. P-Notes are issued by *registered foreign portfolio investors (FPIs)*, not domestic mutual funds.  The text clarifies that these notes are a mechanism for indirect investment by overseas investors, bypassing direct registration requirements.  Domestic mutual funds are not involved in this process.


**18. With reference to the Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge, consider the following statements:**

1. The treaty is primarily focused on protecting intellectual property rights related to software and digital technologies.
2.  The treaty acknowledges the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The treaty's focus is on the interface between intellectual property (IP), genetic resources (GRs), and traditional knowledge (TK), encompassing a much broader scope than just software and digital technologies.  The description highlights its aim to address the intersection of these three areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the treaty acknowledges the UNDRIP and its commitments. This acknowledgement reflects the treaty's consideration of the rights and interests of indigenous peoples in relation to traditional knowledge.


**19. With reference to measures taken by the Indian government to protect Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Genetic Resources (GRs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) primarily focuses on registering patents for traditional medicinal practices.
2. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, aims to prevent the misappropriation of TK and GRs through fair and equitable benefit-sharing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the TKDL is a digital repository of traditional knowledge, its purpose is to *prevent biopiracy and wrongful patents*, not to register patents for traditional practices.  The library serves as a defensive measure to protect traditional knowledge against unauthorized appropriation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, is explicitly designed to ensure fair and equitable benefit-sharing related to the utilization of TK and GRs.  This mechanism aims to prevent the misappropriation of traditional knowledge and genetic resources by ensuring that local communities benefit from their use.



**1. With reference to deep-sea mining, consider the following statements:**

1. Polymetallic nodules, primarily composed of manganese and iron, are potato-shaped mineral lumps found on the seabed.
2. Seafloor massive sulphides, located near hydrothermal vents, are rich in copper, gold, and zinc, but lack significant silver deposits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Polymetallic nodules are indeed small, potato-shaped mineral deposits found on the ocean floor.  They are rich in manganese and iron, along with other valuable metals.  The description accurately reflects their composition and location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While seafloor massive sulphides are found near hydrothermal vents and do contain copper, gold, and zinc, they also contain significant amounts of silver.  The omission of silver in the statement makes it factually inaccurate.  The presence of silver is a key characteristic of these deposits and a significant factor in their economic value.


**2. With reference to the Indian steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's per capita steel consumption significantly surpasses the global average, reflecting its robust industrial growth.
2. The steel industry's reliance on imported coking coal contributes significantly to its production costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that India's per capita finished steel consumption (97.7 kg in 2023-24) is considerably *lower* than the global average (219.3 kg) and drastically lower than China's (628.3 kg). This indicates a significant gap in steel consumption between India and global benchmarks, contradicting the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly highlights that India heavily relies on costly imports of coking coal from Australia to meet its needs. This dependence on imports directly impacts the production costs within the Indian steel industry, making it a key challenge for the sector's competitiveness.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text indicates that PMMSY is an "umbrella scheme" aiming to address gaps in *both* fish production and productivity across marine *and* inland fisheries sectors. It doesn't solely focus on inland fisheries; its scope encompasses the entire fisheries value chain.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that PMMSY promotes the adoption of advanced technologies such as RAS and Biofloc to improve efficiency and sustainability in aquaculture.  These technologies are key components of the scheme's strategy for modernizing the fisheries sector.


**4. With reference to India's horticulture sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India's gross cropped area under horticulture accounts for over 20% of its total agricultural land.
2. India holds the global top rank in the production of bananas, mangoes, and papayas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that India's gross cropped area under horticulture is 13.1%, which is less than 20%.  The statement misrepresents the actual percentage.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately states that India ranks first globally in the production of bananas, mangoes, and papayas. This highlights India's significant position in the global horticulture market for these specific fruits.

**9. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs primarily cater to the needs of rural populations, providing financial services in underserved areas.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monitors the capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability of UCBs to ensure their financial soundness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UCBs do serve urban populations, the statement implies an exclusive focus on rural areas, which is inaccurate.  UCBs operate within urban settings, catering to the financial needs of urban residents and businesses.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that the RBI closely monitors key parameters like capital, asset quality, and profitability for UCBs. This monitoring is crucial for ensuring their financial health and stability within the banking system.


**10. With reference to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement mandates compulsory licensing for patented products only in developed countries.
2. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement emphasizes the importance of protecting public health while upholding intellectual property rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Doha Declaration explicitly acknowledges the need to balance intellectual property rights with public health considerations. It affirms that TRIPS should not prevent countries from taking measures to protect public health, highlighting a crucial aspect of the agreement's interpretation and application.


**11. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  GFCF as a percentage of GDP consistently remained above 25% throughout the post-independence period.
2.  A decline in private investment contributed to the slowdown in GFCF growth from 2011-12 onwards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text shows that GFCF as a percentage of GDP fluctuated considerably post-independence.  While it rose significantly in the period leading up to 2007-08, it subsequently declined and was considerably below 25% in 2020-21.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate picture of GFCF's historical trend.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly points out that private investment started declining from 2011-12, which directly contributed to the sluggish growth of GFCF. This decline in private sector participation is identified as a key factor in the slowdown.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While KISAN does leverage space technology and geoiNformatics for yield estimation,  it's inaccurate to say it *doesn't* use Artificial Intelligence.  The broader context of modern agricultural technology suggests that AI would likely be integrated into such a system for enhanced analysis and prediction.  The omission of AI is a potentially misleading simplification.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that ADeX includes three datasets: farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and *crops-sown data*. The statement leaves out the crucial "crops-sown data," which is a key aspect of the platform's functionality.  This omission makes the statement incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**13. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MSP is announced at the end of the harvesting season to ensure accurate assessment of crop yields.
2.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the MSP for all crops without any government oversight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that MSP is announced at the *beginning* of the sowing season, not the end of the harvesting season. This timing is crucial for allowing farmers to plan their cultivation based on the guaranteed minimum price.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CACP *recommends* MSP, the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by the Prime Minister.  The statement incorrectly attributes sole authority to the CACP, neglecting the role of the government in the final decision-making process.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the rules address deep-sea mineral resources, they are not limited to polymetallic nodules.  The text mentions various types of deep-sea minerals, including seafloor massive sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, indicating a broader scope than just polymetallic nodules.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the 2024 rules were framed under the Offshore Areas Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 2002. This correctly identifies the legal basis for these regulations.



**1. With reference to the Indian insurance sector's growth, consider the following statements:**

1.  Insurance penetration in 2021-22 was significantly higher than in 2001-02, indicating increased insurance coverage relative to the GDP.
2.  Insurance density in 2021-22, while substantially improved from 2001-02 levels, still suggests a relatively low per capita insurance premium.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that insurance penetration rose from 2.71% in 2001-02 to 4.2% in 2021-22. This demonstrates a considerable increase in the proportion of insurance premiums relative to the GDP, signifying broader insurance coverage within the economy.  This growth signifies increased financial security and risk mitigation within the population.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the insurance density improved from $11.5 in 2001-02 to $91 in 2021-22, a substantial increase,  the figure of $91 still represents a relatively low per capita insurance premium compared to many developed nations. This indicates that while progress has been made, there remains significant scope for expanding insurance coverage and deepening financial inclusion within the Indian population.  The relatively low density suggests that a large segment of the population remains underinsured.


**2. With reference to the World Bank's B-Ready Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The B-Ready Index, launched in 2024,  replaces the Ease of Doing Business rankings due to data irregularities and ethical concerns associated with the latter.
2. The index currently assesses 50 economies, excluding India, and focuses primarily on policy reforms and investment climate assessments, providing benchmarks and recommendations for governments.

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the B-Ready Index is a replacement for the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings, which were discontinued in 2021 due to identified irregularities in data collection and ethical concerns.  This highlights a shift in the World Bank's methodology for assessing business climates globally.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage indicates that the initial rollout of the B-Ready Index covers 50 economies, explicitly excluding India.  Furthermore, its core functions are presented as encouraging policy reforms through benchmarking, offering policy guidance based on data comparisons, and conducting analysis and research to support private sector development.  These functions directly relate to assessing and improving the business and investment climate.


**3. With reference to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Global MPI, launched in 2010, uses a weighted average of indicators across education, health, and living standards to identify individuals experiencing acute multidimensional poverty.  A person is considered MPI poor if deprived in at least one-third of these indicators.
2. India's National MPI (NMPI), introduced in 2021, incorporates all original global MPI indicators,  adding maternal health and bank account access as additional dimensions of deprivation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of the Global MPI accurately reflects the information provided in the text.  The index uses a weighted average of indicators across education, health, and living standards. The threshold for classification as "MPI poor" is correctly stated as deprivation in at least one-third of the weighted indicators. The 2010 launch date is also consistent with the provided information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NMPI was indeed introduced in 2021 and utilizes the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) for data, the statement incorrectly asserts that *all* original global MPI indicators were retained.  The text explicitly states that *two* additional indicators (maternal health and bank account) were added to the original ten, indicating a modification rather than complete retention.  This detail is crucial for accurately understanding the NMPI's composition.


**4. With reference to the Human Development Report (HDR) and its associated indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) measures gender inequalities across reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation; a lower GII ranking indicates greater gender equality.
2. The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the standard HDI to account for inequalities in income distribution, and a higher IHDI value indicates a more equitable distribution of human development achievements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text accurately describes the GII's focus on reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation as key dimensions of gender inequality. A lower ranking on the GII does indeed signify a higher level of gender equality, as it reflects fewer disparities between men and women in these crucial areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IHDI adjusts the HDI to account for inequalities, but the interpretation of its value is reversed. A *lower* IHDI value, not higher, indicates a greater loss in HDI due to inequality.  A higher IHDI value signifies that human development achievements are more equitably distributed. The statement misinterprets the relationship between the IHDI value and the level of inequality.


**5. With reference to  Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to low-income households (with an annual income up to ₹3,00,000) and regulates Microfinance Institutions (MFIs).
2. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹20 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, with loans categorized into Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun (now including Tarun Plus, expanding the upper limit).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the RBI defines microfinance loans based on the criteria of collateral-free lending to low-income households with an annual income up to ₹3,00,000.  It also clearly assigns the regulatory role for MFIs operating in India to the RBI.

Statement 2 is also correct. The information provided accurately describes the PMMY, including its loan amount (up to ₹20 lakh with the recent Tarun Plus addition) and the categorization of loans (Shishu, Kishore, Tarun, and now Tarun Plus). The expansion to ₹20 lakh for those who successfully repaid previous Tarun loans is also correctly reflected.  This shows government initiatives to support micro and small enterprises.

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monitors UCBs primarily focusing on their capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability.
2.  A UCB can be placed under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) if it consistently breaches pre-defined risk thresholds in any of these parameters for four consecutive quarters.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the RBI's oversight and regulatory framework for UCBs.  Statement 1 correctly identifies capital adequacy, asset quality, and profitability as key monitoring areas. The RBI's supervisory actions are designed to ensure the financial health and stability of UCBs.  Statement 2 is also correct; the PCA framework is a crucial tool for addressing financial distress in UCBs.  A consistent failure to meet the specified risk thresholds across multiple quarters triggers the PCA mechanism, leading to restrictions and supervisory interventions aimed at restoring the UCB's financial soundness.  The four consecutive quarters requirement ensures that the action is not taken prematurely based on temporary fluctuations.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines microfinance loans as collateral-free loans to individuals or groups from households with an annual income exceeding ₹3,00,000.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) exclusively provides microfinance loans to women entrepreneurs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents the RBI's definition of microfinance loans. The RBI actually defines them as collateral-free loans to low-income households with an annual income *up to* ₹3,00,000, not exceeding it.  This is a crucial distinction, as it highlights the target population of microfinance initiatives. Statement 2 is also incorrect because PMMY isn't exclusively for women entrepreneurs; it provides loans to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, encompassing a broader range of beneficiaries than just women.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the facts related to microfinance in India.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMMSY is an umbrella scheme designed to address critical gaps across the entire fish production and productivity value chain, encompassing both marine and inland fisheries.  Its focus isn't limited to post-harvest infrastructure; it addresses technology, infrastructure, and value chain strengthening for both sectors.  Statement 2 is correct; the Rangeen Machhli app is indeed a PMMSY initiative providing multilingual information on ornamental fish species. This aligns with the scheme's broader objective of promoting sustainable and diversified fisheries. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding deep-sea mining:**

1.  Polymetallic nodules, a target of deep-sea mining, are primarily composed of high concentrations of copper and gold.
2.  The exploration and mining of deep-sea minerals are governed by a standardized set of international norms applicable to all types of deposits and minerals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While polymetallic nodules do contain valuable metals, their primary composition includes high concentrations of manganese and iron, not copper and gold. Copper and gold are present, but not as the dominant components. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While there are efforts toward establishing international norms for deep-sea mining, a completely standardized set of norms covering all types of deep-sea mineral deposits (including polymetallic nodules, seafloor massive sulphides, and cobalt-rich crusts) is not yet fully in place. The regulatory landscape is still evolving, with different regions and international bodies having varying regulations.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the Indian steel sector, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's per capita steel consumption significantly exceeds the global average.
2.  The Indian steel industry's reliance on imported coking coal makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global coal prices and potential carbon taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's per capita finished steel consumption is considerably *lower* than the global average. The provided text highlights this disparity, indicating that India's consumption lags behind global and especially Chinese levels.  Statement 2 is correct. India's significant reliance on imported coking coal (a crucial element in steel production) exposes the domestic steel industry to price volatility in the international coal market.  Furthermore, the imposition of carbon taxes by importing countries (like the EU) directly impacts the competitiveness of Indian steel exports.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate.


**6.  With reference to monetary policy tools, consider the following statements:**

1.  An increase in the repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) generally leads to increased market liquidity and higher borrowing by businesses and individuals.
2.  The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is a mechanism used by the RBI to absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An increase in the repo rate has the opposite effect; it makes borrowing more expensive, reducing market liquidity and discouraging borrowing by businesses and individuals. This is a standard monetary policy tool used to control inflation. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Variable Rate Repo (VRR) is used to *inject* short-term liquidity, not absorb it.  The Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) is the tool used to absorb excess liquidity. Therefore, both statements misrepresent the functions of these monetary policy tools.


**7. With reference to Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Recent revisions to PSL guidelines aim to reduce lending to economically disadvantaged districts.
2.  PSL norms mandate that banks allocate a certain percentage of their lending to specific sectors deemed crucial for national development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Recent revisions to PSL guidelines actually aim to *increase* lending to economically disadvantaged districts, promoting financial inclusion and development in those areas.  The goal is to improve access to credit in underserved regions. Statement 2 is correct.  PSL norms are indeed a key aspect of India's banking system, requiring banks to allocate a certain percentage of their credit to sectors like agriculture, small-scale industries, and other priority areas.  This policy is designed to channel credit towards sectors crucial for economic growth and social development. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8.  With reference to the Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio, consider the following statements:**

1.  A high CD ratio always indicates robust economic growth and low risk for banks.
2.  The RBI's Financial Stability Report indicates that a majority of banks with high CD ratios are public sector banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a high CD ratio might suggest significant lending activity, potentially stimulating economic growth, it also indicates a higher risk for banks.  A large proportion of assets tied up in loans increases the bank's vulnerability to loan defaults.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RBI's report indicates that over 75% of banks with CD ratios above 75% are *private* sector banks, not public sector banks. This highlights a different dynamic in lending practices between the two sectors.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the implications and data related to the CD ratio.


**9. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is a measure of financial inclusion that only considers banking penetration.
2. The FI-Index is published bi-annually by the RBI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is a *comprehensive* index that goes beyond banking penetration. It incorporates data from banking, investment, insurance, postal, and pension sectors to provide a holistic picture of financial inclusion.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The FI-Index is published *annually*, not bi-annually, by the RBI.  The frequency of publication is explicitly stated in the provided text.  Therefore, neither statement is accurate regarding the FI-Index.


**10. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS only covers complaints against commercial banks.
2. The RB-IOS is established under the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, but not the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS covers a much wider range of regulated entities beyond just commercial banks. It includes regional rural banks, scheduled and non-scheduled urban co-operative banks (meeting certain criteria), and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs, excluding housing finance companies) that accept deposits or have customer interfaces. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The RB-IOS is explicitly stated to be formed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in addition to the RBI Act, 1934, and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.  Therefore, neither statement accurately describes the scope and legal basis of the RB-IOS.


**11. With reference to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

2. The TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licensing, enabling the production of patented products or processes without the patent owner's consent under specific circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TRIPS Agreement does *not* mandate patents for all inventions.  It sets minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights, but member countries retain some flexibility in determining patentable subject matter.  Statement 2 is correct.  The TRIPS Agreement does include provisions for compulsory licensing, recognizing that this mechanism can be important for public health and development in certain situations.  This flexibility is crucial for developing countries to access essential medicines and technologies.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. With reference to Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), consider the following statements:**

1.  Private GFCF as a percentage of GDP in India has consistently increased since the economic liberalization in the 1990s.
2.  GFCF is a key indicator of investment in the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While GFCF rose significantly in the period leading up to 2007-08, it has experienced periods of decline and fluctuation since then, not consistently increasing. The provided text specifically mentions a drop in private investment from 2011-12 onwards.  Statement 2 is correct. GFCF (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) is indeed a crucial indicator of investment in an economy. It measures the total investment in fixed assets, such as machinery, equipment, and infrastructure. This makes it a vital metric for understanding economic growth and development. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**13. With reference to the Horticulture sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Horticulture accounts for less than 10% of India’s gross cropped area.
2.  India is the world's leading producer of bananas, mangoes, and papayas.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text indicates that horticulture accounts for 13.1% of India's gross cropped area, exceeding the 10% threshold.  Statement 2 is correct. India is indeed ranked first globally in the production of bananas, mangoes, and papayas, highlighting its significant position in the global horticulture market.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**14. With reference to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  NBFCs are permitted to accept demand deposits like commercial banks.
2.  The Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs categorizes them into four layers based on their size and risk profile, with each tier facing differential regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A key distinction between NBFCs and banks is that NBFCs are *not* permitted to accept demand deposits.  This is a fundamental difference in their operational structure and regulatory oversight.  Statement 2 is correct. The SBR framework for NBFCs accurately categorizes them into four layers based on size, activity, and risk, applying tailored regulatory requirements to each tier.  This risk-based approach is a significant aspect of NBFC regulation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**15. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Financial Stability Report (FSR) primarily focuses on the negative aspects of NPAs without acknowledging any achievements in NPA management.
2.  NPAs represent loans that are in default or have a high probability of default.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FSR analyzes the risks and challenges posed by NPAs, it also highlights achievements made in NPA management.  The text mentions that the FSR highlights achievements, suggesting a balanced perspective.  Statement 2 is correct.  NPAs represent loans where borrowers have defaulted on their repayment obligations or are highly likely to default.  This is a standard definition used in financial reporting and risk assessment.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

2. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is a regional organization headquartered in London, UK, and owns 63 central banks globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project Nexus is a *multilateral* initiative, not bilateral, involving India and several ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) to interconnect their domestic Instant Payment Systems (IPS).  It's not solely focused on India and Singapore.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is indeed owned by 63 central banks, including the RBI, but its headquarters are in Basel, Switzerland, not London. The BIS is also an *international*, not regional, organization.


**2. With reference to Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FVCIs are primarily Indian entities registered with SEBI to invest in Indian venture capital funds.
2. Venture capital funds (VCFs) in India are primarily used for low-risk, low-return investments in established businesses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FVCIs are *foreign* entities incorporated outside India, registered under SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000. They invest in Indian venture capital funds or venture capital undertakings (unlisted companies).

Statement 2 is incorrect. VCFs are specifically designed for *high-risk, high-return* investments in new ventures.  The high risk is inherent to the early-stage nature of the businesses they fund, which carries the potential for substantial returns if successful.

1. The Indian Space Association (ISpA) is a government agency under the Department of Space (DoS) responsible for commercial space activities.
2. The announced venture capital fund of Rs. 1,000 crore aims to reduce India's share in the global commercial space economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that the RBI issued a new PCA framework for UCBs, effective from April 1, 2025, replacing the SAF and applying to most UCBs.  This demonstrates a shift in regulatory approach towards UCBs, focusing on proactive corrective measures. The exclusion of UCBs under AID is also mentioned, highlighting a nuanced regulatory approach.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly describes the NUCFDC's role as an umbrella organization for UCBs, its registration as a Type II NBFC-ND, its capital-raising target, and its provision of fund management and consultancy services. The mention of its function as an SRO further emphasizes its regulatory role within the UCB sector.  The detail about its capital raising target (Rs. 300 crores) adds a specific factual element to the statement.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect information provided about UCBs and related regulatory bodies.



**2. With reference to Microfinance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) provides loans up to ₹10 lakh to non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises, categorized as Shishu, Kishore, and Tarun, with the 2024 Union Budget increasing the Tarun category limit to ₹20 lakh (Tarun Plus) for those who have successfully repaid previous loans.
2.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s Malegam Committee (2010) recommended a regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies – Microfinance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs), and the RBI is the regulatory body for MFIs operating in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect information about microfinance in India. Statement 1 correctly describes the PMMY, its loan limits, categorization of loans, and the 2024 budget enhancement.  The specific mention of the "Tarun Plus" category and the condition for eligibility (successful repayment of previous Tarun loans) provides a degree of specificity that distinguishes it from a general statement about PMMY.

Statement 2 accurately identifies the RBI's role in regulating MFIs and the Malegam Committee's contribution to the regulatory framework for NBFC-MFIs.  The inclusion of the year (2010) and the specific committee name adds to the factual accuracy and precision of the statement, making it more difficult to guess.  Thus, both statements provide accurate and detailed information on the subject.


**3. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) regulatory actions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), published annually in July, measures financial inclusion across the country using a single-value index (0 to 100), where 0 represents complete exclusion and 100 represents full inclusion.  The index incorporates details from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.
2.  The RBI, under the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), 2021, provides a cost-free redressal mechanism for customer grievances related to services from regulated entities, including commercial banks, regional rural banks, and certain cooperative and non-banking financial companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the RBI's FI-Index, its purpose, methodology (single-value index from 0 to 100), publication frequency, and the sectors it encompasses. The specific details about the index's range and components make it less susceptible to casual guessing.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the RB-IOS, its objective (cost-free redressal), and the types of regulated entities it covers (commercial banks, RRBs, and specific cooperative and NBFCs). The inclusion of the year (2021) and the specific name of the scheme adds to the factual nature of the statement.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the RBI's regulatory activities in the areas of financial inclusion and grievance redressal.


**4. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and related regulatory frameworks, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's biannual Financial Stability Report (FSR) assesses the financial health of the banking sector, and the FSDC's sub-committee underlies its assessment.  The report highlighted that scheduled commercial banks' Gross NPAs (GNPAs) and Net NPA ratios fell to multi-year lows at the end of March 2024.
2.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, facilitates the recovery of secured loans by allowing secured creditors to take possession of collateral upon default; while the IBC, 2016, provides a framework for corporate insolvency resolution. The National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) aims to resolve stressed assets above ₹500 crore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the RBI's FSR, its basis (FSDC sub-committee assessment), and its recent findings regarding NPA ratios. The inclusion of specific data (multi-year lows at March-end 2024) makes the statement more challenging.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the roles of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, the IBC, 2016, and NARCL in addressing NPAs.  The inclusion of the specific amounts (₹500 crore) and the detailed description of the roles of these different legislative and corporate instruments makes this statement harder to answer without detailed knowledge of the topic.  Both statements provide accurate and detailed information on NPA management and related regulatory measures in India.



**5.  With reference to Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters, consider the following statements:**

1. A wilful defaulter is defined as a borrower who defaults on loan repayments, possessing the capacity to pay but exhibiting characteristics such as fund diversion, asset disposal, or failure to infuse equity despite the ability to do so.  The threshold for a wilful defaulter is an outstanding amount of ₹25 lakh and above.
2. A large defaulter is defined as a borrower with an outstanding amount of ₹1 crore and above, where a suit has been filed or the account is classified as doubtful or a loss.  Lenders use an Identification Committee to examine evidence of wilful default.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines a wilful defaulter, highlighting the key criteria of repayment capacity, yet exhibiting actions like fund diversion or asset disposal. The specific threshold of ₹25 lakh and above is also correctly stated.

Statement 2 correctly defines a large defaulter, specifying the outstanding amount threshold (₹1 crore and above) and the conditions of a filed suit or account classification.  The mention of the Identification Committee further adds factual detail.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the definitions and processes related to wilful and large defaulters.  The specific monetary thresholds make these statements less easily guessable.


**6. With reference to the regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  NBFCs are categorized into four tiers based on size, activity, and risk, and each tier faces different regulatory requirements under the Scale-based Regulation (SBR) framework.  NBFCs cannot accept demand deposits, are not part of the payment and settlement system, and their depositors lack DICGC coverage.
2.  The RBI regulates NBFCs through various entities and acts.  For example, the National Housing Bank regulates Housing Finance Companies, SEBI regulates certain NBFCs involved in securities markets, and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs regulates Nidhi Companies.  State Governments regulate Chit Fund Companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the SBR for NBFCs, their limitations (no demand deposits, exclusion from payment systems, no DICGC coverage), and the basis for the tiered regulatory approach. The detail regarding the exclusion of certain activities and the lack of DICGC coverage provides crucial factual elements.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the regulatory bodies overseeing different types of NBFCs. The mention of specific regulatory bodies (National Housing Bank, SEBI, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, State Governments) and the types of NBFCs they regulate provides detailed, factual information.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the regulatory landscape for NBFCs in India, highlighting the diverse regulatory agencies and approaches.  The specific mention of the regulatory bodies and the types of NBFCs they oversee adds to the factual depth and complexity of the question.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural data infrastructure:**

1. KISAN uses space technology and geoinformatics to improve crop yield estimation, while ADeX is a platform for farmer services holding datasets on farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and crops sown.
2. The Krishi Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) employs AI, remote sensing, and GIS for informed decision-making in agriculture, focusing primarily on real-time monitoring of crop health and weather patterns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. KISAN (Crop Insurance using Space technology And geoiNformatics) indeed leverages space technology and geoinformatics to enhance crop yield estimation accuracy.  ADeX (Agricultural Data Exchange) functions as a centralized platform providing crucial data for farmer services, encompassing farmer identity, geotagged farm locations, and sown crop details. Both systems contribute significantly to improving agricultural efficiency and decision-making.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Krishi ICCC (Integrated Command and Control Centre) is a technology-driven initiative under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. It utilizes AI, remote sensing, and GIS to facilitate informed decision-making within the agricultural sector.  While real-time monitoring is a key component, its applications are broader, encompassing data analysis for resource allocation, policy formulation, and overall agricultural planning.  Therefore, the description in statement 2, while not entirely inaccurate, is a simplification of the ICCC's comprehensive functionalities.


**2. With reference to Minimum Support Price (MSP) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP, announced before the sowing season, is the minimum price at which the government procures 24 crops, including all Kharif, Rabi, and commercial crops, ensuring farmers against distress selling.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP based on A2+FL cost, while the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MSP aims to prevent distress selling and is announced before the sowing season, the number of crops covered is 22, not 24. The 22 crops include 14 Kharif, 6 Rabi, and 2 commercial crops, along with MSPs for Toria and de-husked coconut derived from those of rapeseed & mustard, and copra respectively.  The statement overstates the number of covered crops.

Statement 2 is correct. The CACP (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) indeed recommends the MSP, considering various cost factors, including A2+FL (Actual cost of production plus Family Labour).  The final authority for determining the MSP rests with the CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs), chaired by the Prime Minister.  This statement accurately reflects the decision-making process for MSP implementation.


**3. With reference to India's Agricultural Export Policy, consider the following statements:**

1. The ambitious target set by India's Agricultural Export Policy, 2018, of achieving $60 billion in agricultural exports by 2022 was surpassed, with exports registering an 8% increase in 2023-24.
2.  Rice is the leading agricultural export item for India, followed by marine products and spices, whereas vegetable oil constitutes the largest agricultural import, followed by pulses and fruits & vegetables.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that agricultural exports in India experienced an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the $60 billion target set for 2022 by the Agricultural Export Policy, 2018.  The statement contradicts the given information.

Statement 2 is correct.  The data presented indicates that rice holds the largest share (21%) of India's total agricultural exports, followed by marine products (15%) and spices (9%). On the import side, vegetable oil constitutes the highest percentage (45%) of agricultural imports, with pulses (11%) and fruits & vegetables (8%) following. The statement accurately reflects the composition of India's agricultural trade.


**4. Consider the following statements about Cooperative Banks in India:**

1. Cooperative banks, registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, operate solely for the mutual benefit of their members, accepting deposits and extending loans only to those members and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. To be considered a cooperative bank, an institution must have at least two hundred members and net owned funds of ten lakh rupees or more, and all such banks are subject to RBI's Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Cooperative banks primarily serve the mutual benefit of their members, restricting their deposit acceptance and loan disbursement activities to these members.  However, the statement is slightly misleading in claiming that *all* cooperative banks are regulated by the RBI.  While some aspects of their operations might be overseen by the RBI, they are primarily registered and administered under the respective State Cooperative Societies Act and regulated by the State Registrar of Cooperative Societies.  The RBI's regulatory purview is limited to certain aspects, particularly concerning larger cooperative banks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the criteria of at least two hundred members and net owned funds of ten lakh rupees or more are mentioned in the text for a specific type of cooperative bank, it doesn't apply universally to all cooperative banks.  Furthermore, PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Societies), a significant type of cooperative bank, are explicitly stated as being *outside* the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  The statement presents an overgeneralized and inaccurate representation of the regulatory framework.


**5. With reference to the ISI Mark in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The ISI mark, a mandatory quality and safety assurance for all products sold in India, is issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) under Scheme II of the BIS Act, 2016.
2.  The Central Government mandates the ISI mark for certain products through Quality Control Orders (QCOs), including electrical appliances, cement, automobile accessories, medical equipment, and steel and iron products, but not necessarily toys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI mark is not mandatory for *all* products sold in India.  It is mandated for specific products determined by the Central Government through QCOs (Quality Control Orders).  The statement also incorrectly refers to "Scheme II"; the text mentions "Scheme I" of the BIS (ISI Mark Scheme) under which QCOs are issued.  The BIS Act, 2016, provides the legal framework, but the statement misrepresents the scope and implementation of the ISI mark.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Central Government does indeed mandate the ISI mark for certain products via QCOs. The listed product categories—electrical appliances, cement, automobile accessories, medical equipment, and steel and iron products—are examples given in the source material. The statement's qualification regarding toys is accurate as, while toys are mentioned as potentially subject to ISI marking, it's not an absolute inclusion in all cases.  Therefore, the statement, while not perfectly comprehensive, is more accurate than statement 1.


**6. With reference to "Green Shoots" in the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The term "Green Shoots" refers to early indicators of economic recovery in a specific sector, such as the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, after a period of economic slowdown or recession, predominantly driven by rural economic activity.
2. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified the rural economy as a significant driver of growth in the FMCG sector, signifying that the rural economy is showing positive signs of growth, even when the overall economic growth is sluggish.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  "Green shoots" accurately describes early signs of economic recovery or growth following a downturn. The statement correctly identifies its application to sectoral analysis, such as in the FMCG sector, implying that the growth may be confined to a particular part of the economy.  The reference to rural economic activity as a driver reflects the specific context of the RBI's observation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The RBI's assessment directly supports this statement. The RBI's identification of the rural economy as a key driver of growth in the FMCG sector implies that positive trends are visible in the rural economy, even if overall economic growth might be slower. This aligns precisely with the concept of "green shoots" indicating early signs of recovery within a specific segment.


**7. With reference to Household Savings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Household savings are broadly categorized into financial savings (currency, deposits, life insurance funds, etc.) and physical savings (physical assets, gold, and silver), with a decline in physical savings posing greater challenges to the banking sector compared to a decline in financial savings.
2. The household savings rate, expressed as the ratio of household savings to GDP, reveals that the Indian household sector typically invests more than it saves, relying on external sources to meet its investment needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The categorization of household savings into financial and physical forms is accurate.  The statement's assertion about the relative impact of a decline in physical versus financial savings on the banking sector is debatable. While a decline in financial savings directly affects banking sector liquidity and credit risk, a decline in physical savings has a less direct impact.  However, the core idea of the two categories and their general impact is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states the opposite:  "In India, household sector typically generates surplus savings relative to its investments, lending the excess to other sectors."  The statement misrepresents the relationship between household savings and investment in India.  The Indian household sector generally saves more than it invests, lending the surplus to other sectors of the economy.


**8. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Council, established to address the taxation of luxury, sin, and demerit goods after the compensation cess ends in March 2026, levies a compensation cess at varied rates on these goods, in addition to the standard 28% GST rate.
2.  The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, compensates states for revenue losses incurred due to GST implementation, with the compensation cess levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods contributing to this compensation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GST Council's role in addressing the taxation of luxury, sin, and demerit goods is accurate.  The council's intention to decide on the taxation of these goods after the compensation cess ends in March 2026 is also stated.  The fact that a compensation cess is levied at varied rates on these goods, over and above the 28% GST, is also true.

Statement 2 is also correct. The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was indeed enacted to compensate states for revenue losses arising from GST implementation.  The compensation cess levied on luxury, sin, and demerit goods serves as a critical source of funds for this compensation mechanism, as stated in the given text.  The statement correctly links the compensation cess to the revenue-sharing mechanism among the states.


**9.  With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on finished goods is higher than the GST rate on the inputs used to produce those goods.
2.  IDS leads to increased working capital requirements and refund-related issues for taxpayers because the GST paid on inputs (Input Tax Credit or ITC) remains blocked and cannot be fully offset against the GST payable on sales.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The definition of IDS is that import duties or GST on input goods are *higher* than on finished goods. The statement reverses this relationship.  In an inverted duty structure, the tax burden on inputs is greater than that on the final product.

Statement 2 is correct.  IDS does create working capital problems because the Input Tax Credit (ITC) generated from higher taxes on inputs cannot be fully utilized to offset the lower tax on the final product. This leads to a blockage of funds and necessitates refunds, often creating delays and administrative challenges for taxpayers. The statement accurately describes the negative consequences of IDS for businesses.


**10. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The recent amendment abolishes indexation benefits for long-term capital gains on immovable properties acquired after July 23, 2024, but allows properties acquired before this date to retain the benefit under a grandfather clause.
2. The Finance Bill, 2024, introduced a provision for a flat 20% tax rate on all long-term capital gains, eliminating the distinction between different types of assets and the indexation benefit for all assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendment to LTCG provisions focuses specifically on immovable properties. It removes indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* July 23, 2024, but includes a grandfather clause protecting properties acquired *before* that date.  The statement accurately reflects the key aspects of this targeted amendment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Bill, 2024, did make changes to LTCG taxation, it did *not* introduce a flat 20% tax rate on *all* long-term capital gains, eliminating indexation benefits for *all* assets.  The amendment was specifically targeted at immovable properties acquired after a specific date, as indicated in statement 1. The statement overgeneralizes the scope of the amendment.


**11. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP), consider the following statements:**

1. The PMGS NMP, a digital master planning tool developed by BISAG-N using GIS, integrates data from ISRO satellite imagery and Survey of India basemaps, and is hosted on the Meghraj cloud platform.
2. The PMGS NMP's seven engines—Railways, Roads, Ports, Waterways, Airports, Mass Transport, and Logistics Infrastructure—are designed to improve connectivity, reduce logistics costs, and enhance the ease of doing business in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of PMGS NMP's development by BISAG-N using GIS, its integration with ISRO and Survey of India data, and its hosting on the Meghraj cloud are all accurate according to the provided text.

Statement 2 is also correct. The seven engines identified in the statement are indeed the core components of the PM GatiShakti initiative.  The stated goals—improving connectivity, reducing logistics costs, and enhancing ease of doing business—align perfectly with the overall objectives of the PMGS NMP.  The statement accurately summarizes the plan's purpose and intended outcomes.


**12. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Bank's Benchmarking Infrastructure Development report analyzes PPP regulatory landscapes globally, indicating India's PPP framework is among the top-performing globally.
2.  The Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs handles policy-level matters related to PPPs, while the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text mentions the World Bank's report analyzing PPP regulatory landscapes across 140 economies. However, it does *not* state that India's framework is among the top performers.  The statement draws a conclusion not supported by the information.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that the Private Investment Unit in the Department of Economic Affairs is responsible for policy-level PPP matters, and the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.  The statement correctly identifies the key entities and their roles in the Indian PPP framework.


**13. With reference to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. SEBI's amendments to InvIT Regulations 2024 allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors only upon the acquisition of infrastructure projects.
2. InvITs, similar to mutual funds, allow investors to participate in infrastructure projects, earning income through tolls, rents, interest, or dividends, and are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The SEBI amendments to InvIT Regulations 2024, as mentioned, do allow privately placed InvITs to issue subordinate units to sponsors specifically upon the acquisition of infrastructure projects. This detail is directly stated in the provided text.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The description of InvITs as investment vehicles similar to mutual funds, their income-generating mechanisms (tolls, rents, interest, dividends), and their recognition as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002, are all accurate according to the given text.  The statement accurately characterizes the nature and legal status of InvITs.


**14. With reference to the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, consider the following statements:**

1. The Inclusive Framework, involving 147 countries and jurisdictions (including India), aims to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) through a two-pillar approach: Pillar One focuses on reallocating profits of large multinational enterprises (MNEs) to market jurisdictions, while Pillar Two establishes a global minimum corporate tax rate.
2.  The Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS, signed by India in 2017, updates international tax rules to reduce opportunities for tax avoidance by MNEs, and the Inclusive Framework is a separate initiative that does not directly influence the Convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, its membership, and its two-pillar approach (Pillar One for profit allocation and Pillar Two for minimum corporate tax) are all accurate.  The statement correctly outlines the framework's goals and mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement implies that the Multilateral Convention and the Inclusive Framework are distinct and unrelated.  However, the Convention is a *result* of the BEPS project that led to the creation of the Inclusive Framework.  The two are interconnected, with the Convention aiming to implement some of the measures agreed upon within the Inclusive Framework.  The statement inaccurately portrays their relationship.


**15. With reference to Duty Drawback in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) electronically disburses duty drawback amounts to exporters' bank accounts using the Public Finance Management System, under the Customs Act, 1962.
2. Duty Drawback, a rebate on customs duty paid on imported or excisable materials used in export goods, helps exporters offset costs incurred during the export process, and is administered by the CBIC, which is a part of the Department of Revenue under the Union Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of the CBIC's electronic disbursement of duty drawback amounts using the Public Finance Management System is accurate.  The mention of the Customs Act, 1962, as the legal basis is also correct.

Statement 2 is also correct. The explanation of duty drawback as a rebate on customs duty for imported or excisable materials used in exports is accurate. The statement also correctly identifies the CBIC as the administering body and its position within the Department of Revenue under the Union Ministry of Finance.  The statement provides a clear and accurate description of the duty drawback mechanism and its administrative context.


**16. With reference to Windfall Tax in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The windfall tax, imposed on industries experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favorable economic conditions, is currently levied on domestically produced crude oil only.
2. The Central Government has the power to reduce or abolish the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil at any time, based on prevailing market conditions and the economic situation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that the Centre has reduced the windfall tax on domestically produced crude oil. While the text doesn't specify whether it's levied on other products, the focus on crude oil reduction suggests a current concentration on this sector.

Statement 2 is also correct. The government's ability to adjust or remove the windfall tax based on economic factors is implicit in the very nature of a windfall tax.  Such taxes are typically temporary measures responding to specific market conditions; thus, the government retains the authority to modify or eliminate them as needed.  The statement accurately reflects the dynamic nature of windfall taxes and the government's power to adjust them.


**17. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Seven CRAs—Acuite, CRISIL, ICRA, CARE, India Ratings, INFOMERICS, and Brickwork—are registered with SEBI, and all are accredited by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as External Credit Assessment Institutions for rating bank loans and facilities.
2. SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, and guidelines for dealing with conflicts of interest, and RBI also regulates certain aspects of CRAs under its sectoral jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While seven CRAs are listed as registered with SEBI, the statement incorrectly claims that *all* are accredited by the RBI.  The text explicitly states that only six CRAs (excluding Brickwork Ratings) have RBI accreditation.  The statement contains a factual inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulations do require CRAs to disclose their rating methodologies and conflict-of-interest policies. The statement also correctly points out that the RBI, in addition to SEBI, also regulates certain aspects of CRAs within its respective area of authority.  The statement accurately reflects the dual regulatory oversight of CRAs.


**18. With reference to the Jute sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jute Corporation of India (JCI), established in 1971, implements the Jute I-CARE project, aiming to mechanize jute farming and improve retting processes using microbial consortia.
2. The Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, mandates the use of jute packaging materials for all commodities, regardless of their nature or packaging requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The information about JCI's establishment, its role as a price support agency, and its implementation of the Jute I-CARE project for mechanization and improved retting are all accurately described in the text.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act mandates the use of jute packaging materials, but it does *not* apply to *all* commodities unconditionally.  The statement overstates the scope of the Act's mandate.  The Act specifies certain commodities and situations where jute packaging is compulsory, not a blanket requirement for all products.


**19. With reference to NABARD's All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey (NAFIS), consider the following statements:**

1. NAFIS, launched in 2016-17, provides a comprehensive overview of rural livelihoods and financial inclusion levels, including access to loans, insurance, and pensions, and the NAFINDEX is derived from the data collected through NAFIS.
2. The second NAFIS survey (2021-22) revealed a significant increase in financial inclusion across all rural areas of India, indicating complete financial inclusion in all rural regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of NAFIS as a comprehensive survey of rural livelihoods and financial inclusion, including its coverage of loans, insurance, and pensions, is accurate. The statement also correctly mentions that NAFINDEX, a measure of financial inclusion, is based on NAFIS data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that the second NAFIS survey provides insights into rural development indicators since 2016-17, it does *not* claim complete financial inclusion across all rural areas.  The statement draws a conclusion not supported by the provided information.  The survey likely provides nuanced data, and a claim of complete financial inclusion would be an oversimplification.


**20. With reference to Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), consider the following statements:**

1. PACS, registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, are the grassroots-level arms of the short-term cooperative credit structure and are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
2. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs), also registered under State Cooperative Societies Acts, provide funds to PACS, and both PACS and DCCBs are subject to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PACS are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, and they are the grassroots arms of the short-term cooperative credit structure. However, they are *not* regulated by the RBI.  The text explicitly states that PACS are outside the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While DCCBs do provide funds to PACS and are registered under State Cooperative Societies Acts, the statement incorrectly asserts that both PACS and DCCBs are subject to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.  The text clearly indicates that PACS are not under this Act's jurisdiction.  The statement contains a factual error concerning the regulatory framework.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's agricultural export policy:**

1.  Agricultural exports in India witnessed an 8% decline in 2023-24, falling short of the ambitious $60 billion target set for 2022.
2.  Rice constitutes the largest share of India's agricultural exports, followed by marine products and spices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that agricultural exports in India declined by 8% in 2023-24 and missed the target of $60 billion set for 2022. This reflects challenges in achieving export targets despite government initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While rice is a significant agricultural export for India (constituting 21% of total exports), the text clearly indicates that marine products (15%) are the second largest export, followed by spices (9%).  The statement incorrectly reverses the order of marine products and spices. This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between significant and less significant exports and to avoid common misconceptions.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMSY aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 1 million tons annually by 2025, indicating a focus on seaweed aquaculture.
2.  The scheme primarily focuses on strengthening the value chain for ornamental fish, promoting their export potential.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions PMMSY's ambitious target of 1 million tons of seaweed production per year by 2025.  This demonstrates the scheme's focus on expanding aquaculture beyond traditional fisheries, including the development of seaweed farming. The statement accurately reflects a key objective of PMMSY.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While PMMSY addresses several aspects of the fisheries sector, including the development of the ornamental fish market (as evidenced by the "Rangeen Machhli" app), its primary focus is not solely on ornamental fish export. The scheme aims for holistic development across various segments of the fisheries and aquaculture industry.  The incorrect statement acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the scheme's broader goals.


**3. With reference to initiatives promoting pulses cultivation in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) scheme procures oilseeds and pulses at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), ensuring price stability for farmers.
2.  The Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) is implemented nationwide to encourage the shift from traditional crops to pulses, thereby enhancing nutritional security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly mentions that PM-AASHA includes a price support scheme for oilseeds and pulses at the MSP. This demonstrates the government's commitment to protecting farmers from distress sales and ensuring price stability for these important crops.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) aims to increase pulse production,  it is specifically implemented in the original Green Revolution States (Haryana, Punjab, and Western Uttar Pradesh), not nationwide. This illustrates the geographically targeted nature of some agricultural initiatives.  The incorrect statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific geographical scope of agricultural programs.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Jute Board (NJB):**

1.  The NJB was established under the National Jute Board Act, 2008, primarily focusing on the development of jute cultivation and marketing.
2.  The Jute Corporation of India (JCI), established in 1971, acts as a price support agency for jute, ensuring a minimum price for farmers' produce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The text explicitly mentions the establishment of the NJB under the 2008 Act and its mandate for developing jute cultivation, manufacturing, and marketing.  The text also confirms the establishment of JCI in 1971 as a price support agency for jute, fulfilling its role in stabilizing farmers' income.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key institutions and their roles in the jute industry.


**5.  With reference to India's millet production, consider the following statements:**

1.  India accounts for approximately 80% of Asia's and 20% of the global millet production, highlighting its dominance in the sector.
2.  The stagnation in millet production is primarily attributed to high consumer demand for millets compared to other cereals, resulting in limited acreage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text accurately states that India accounts for roughly 80% of Asia's and 20% of global millet production, making it a major player in the global millet market.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text attributes the stagnation in millet production to factors like yield gaps due to labor shortages and insufficient fertilizer, a shift in consumer preferences towards fine cereals (not high demand for millets), and storage issues due to the relatively shorter shelf life of millets.  The statement misrepresents the reasons for the production stagnation, serving as a key distractor.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the factors influencing millet production.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding India's horticulture sector:**

1.  India ranks first globally in the production of bananas, mangoes, and papayas, demonstrating its strength in tropical fruit cultivation.
2.  Fruits and vegetables constitute approximately 50% of the total horticulture production in India, reflecting their significant contribution to the sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions India's leading position in the production of bananas, mangoes, and papayas, showcasing its dominance in tropical fruit cultivation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While fruits and vegetables are the major components of horticulture production, the text specifies that they account for 90% (not 50%) of the total horticulture production.  This highlights the need for careful attention to numerical data. The incorrect percentage serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall and interpret quantitative information.


**7. With reference to the Agricultural Data Exchange (ADeX), consider the following statements:**

1.  ADeX is India's first data exchange platform aimed at streamlining farmer services and scheme delivery, using geotagged farm locations and crop-sown data.
2.  ADeX primarily focuses on providing real-time weather forecasts and crop condition assessments through the integration of remote sensing data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes ADeX as India's first data exchange platform for farmer services, utilizing geotagged farm locations and crop-sown data to improve efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ADeX uses data to support decision-making in agriculture, its primary function is not real-time weather forecasting and crop condition assessment. This is the role of other initiatives like the Krishi Decision Support System (DSS) and FASAL project.  The statement misattributes the core function of ADeX, acting as a distractor. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific role of ADeX within the broader context of agricultural technology.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Minimum Support Price (MSP):**

1.  The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends the MSP, with the final decision resting with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by the Prime Minister.
2.  The MSP currently covers 20 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops, ensuring price support for a wide range of agricultural produce.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the process of MSP determination, with CACP's recommendation and the CCEA's final decision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that MSP covers 14 Kharif crops, 6 Rabi crops, and 2 commercial crops, totaling 22 crops (not 20).  The incorrect number of crops serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of factual information. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the MSP mechanism and its scope.


**9. With reference to the  'World's Largest Grain Storage Plan in Cooperative Sector', consider the following statements:**

1. The pilot project of this plan was inaugurated for 11 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) across 11 states, demonstrating a focus on decentralized storage.
2. This initiative primarily aims to improve the cold chain infrastructure for perishable agricultural produce, thereby reducing post-harvest losses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the inauguration of the pilot project for 11 PACS across 11 states. This correctly reflects the initiative's focus on expanding grain storage capacity at the grassroots level using cooperative structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The initiative focuses on grain storage, not specifically on cold chain infrastructure for perishable goods. The cold chain infrastructure is a separate issue addressed by different initiatives.  The statement misrepresents the primary objective of the plan, serving as a distractor. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the initiative's specific goals and implementation strategy.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the  National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP):**

1. Launched in 2018-19, NFSM-OS&OP focuses on seed components (breeding, distribution), production inputs, and technology transfer to improve oilseed production.
2. NFSM-OS&OP primarily aims to expand oil palm cultivation in the North Eastern States and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes NFSM-OS&OP's focus on seed components, production inputs, and technology transfer to boost oilseed production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NFSM-OS&OP does address oil palm cultivation, that's the main focus of the National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), not NFSM-OS&OP.  The statement confuses the objectives of two different schemes, acting as a distractor. This question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between different government schemes and their specific objectives.


**1. With reference to Co-operative Banks in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) solely regulates all aspects of cooperative banks, including their management and incorporation.
2.  Cooperative banks operate on the principle of "one person, one vote," ensuring democratic decision-making among members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cooperative banks in India are under dual control. The RBI regulates their banking aspects (capital adequacy, risk control, lending norms) under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and the Banking Laws (Application to Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965. However, the Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS) of the respective State or Central Government regulates management-related aspects (incorporation, registration, management, audit, board supersession, liquidation).  The RBI does not have sole regulatory authority.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key principle of cooperative banks is "one person, one vote," irrespective of shareholding, promoting democratic participation in decision-making among members who are both owners and customers. This distinguishes them from other banking structures where voting rights are often linked to share ownership.


**2. With reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The LCR mandates that banks hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) equal to 130% of their short-term liabilities, irrespective of market conditions.
2.  A higher LCR indicates a bank's greater ability to withstand short-term liquidity stress during a financial crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the LCR does mandate that banks hold a certain percentage of HQLA relative to their short-term liabilities to meet short-term liquidity needs during a crisis,  the percentage is not a fixed 130%. The actual percentage varies and can be adjusted by regulatory bodies like the RBI.  The statement misrepresents the dynamic nature of the LCR requirement.

Statement 2 is correct. The LCR is a key metric designed to assess a bank's resilience to short-term liquidity shocks. A higher LCR signifies that a bank possesses a larger buffer of high-quality liquid assets, providing greater capacity to meet its obligations even under stressful conditions.  A higher ratio suggests lower liquidity risk.


**3. With reference to Wilful Defaulters, consider the following statements:**

1.  Borrowers with outstanding amounts below ₹25 lakh are automatically excluded from being classified as wilful defaulters.
2.  Wilful defaulters face only civil consequences, such as being barred from future credit, with no potential for criminal charges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition of a wilful defaulter includes a minimum outstanding amount threshold.  Borrowers with outstanding amounts below ₹25 lakh are generally not classified as wilful defaulters, as the threshold is set to target significant levels of default. This does not mean that smaller defaults are not scrutinized, but they fall under different categories of non-performing assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While being barred from future credit is a significant consequence, wilful defaulters also face the potential for criminal charges, reflecting the serious nature of intentionally avoiding loan repayment despite having the capacity to do so.  The potential for legal repercussions extends beyond purely civil penalties.


**4. With reference to the Co-lending Model, consider the following statements:**

1.  In the co-lending model, banks bear the entire credit risk, while Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) only act as intermediaries.
2.  Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The co-lending model involves a risk-sharing arrangement between banks and NBFCs.  While the specific risk allocation may vary depending on the agreement, it's not the case that banks bear the entire risk.  Typically, NBFCs bear a minimum of 20% of the credit risk, with the remaining portion borne by the bank.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Regulations explicitly prohibit banks from entering into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction aims to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and maintain transparency in lending practices.  The intent is to avoid preferential treatment or increased risk associated with related-party transactions.


**5. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index solely focuses on banking penetration, neglecting other financial services such as insurance and investments.
2.  A FI-Index score of 100 represents complete financial exclusion, while a score of 0 signifies complete financial inclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FI-Index is a comprehensive measure encompassing various financial services, including banking, investments, insurance, postal services, and the pension sector.  It provides a holistic view of financial inclusion, not just banking access.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FI-Index uses a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents complete financial exclusion and 100 indicates complete financial inclusion.  The statement reverses the meaning of the scores.


**6. With reference to the Reserve Bank – Integrated Ombudsman Scheme (RB-IOS), consider the following statements:**

1. The RB-IOS covers all Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), irrespective of their asset size.
2. The RB-IOS is primarily aimed at resolving customer grievances related to services provided by only commercial banks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RB-IOS does not cover all NBFCs. It specifically excludes Housing Finance Companies and only covers NBFCs authorized to accept deposits or have customer interface with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above. The scheme has a size-based coverage for NBFCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While commercial banks are covered, the RB-IOS also covers other regulated entities, including Regional Rural Banks, Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks and Non-Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with deposits of ₹50 crore and above.  It's not limited to commercial banks alone.


**7. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework applies to all UCBs, including those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).
2.  Capital adequacy is not a key parameter considered under the PCA framework for UCBs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PCA framework explicitly excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  This shows a differentiated approach based on the bank's existing regulatory status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Capital adequacy, along with asset quality and profitability, are key areas for monitoring under the PCA framework for UCBs.  These three parameters are crucial indicators of a bank's financial health and are used to trigger PCA measures.


**8. With reference to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. UCBs are solely regulated by the State/Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies.
2. UCBs are mandated to achieve a priority sector lending target of 75% by March 2026.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UCBs are under dual regulation. The RBI regulates their banking functions, while the State/Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies oversees management and administrative matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  UCBs are mandated to meet a priority sector lending target of 75% by March 2026. This demonstrates a commitment to supporting priority sectors within the Indian economy.


**9. With reference to Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) and Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1. ARCs are primarily responsible for creating NPAs by providing loans to financially unstable entities.
2. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 8 years of acquisition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ARCs are not responsible for creating NPAs; instead, they acquire NPAs from banks and financial institutions to help resolve them and clean up the balance sheets of the banks.  Their role is remedial, not causative.

Statement 2 is correct.  ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum period of 8 years from the time of acquisition. This timeframe is a regulatory requirement to ensure timely resolution of stressed assets.


**10. With reference to  Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), consider the following statements:**

1. All loans provided by MFIs are considered microfinance loans, irrespective of the borrower's income level.
2. MFIs typically charge lower interest rates compared to commercial banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Only collateral-free loans to low-income households (annual income up to ₹3,00,000) are treated as microfinance loans by the RBI.  Loans exceeding this income threshold or those with collateral are not classified as microfinance loans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. MFIs typically charge higher interest rates than commercial banks.  This is partly due to the higher risk associated with lending to low-income borrowers and the operational costs involved in reaching them.  The higher interest rates are a subject of debate and regulatory scrutiny.


**11. With reference to  the Scale-based Regulation (SBR) for NBFCs, consider the following statements:**

1. The SBR categorizes NBFCs into two layers based on their asset size and perceived riskiness.
2.  Each tier under SBR is subject to identical regulatory requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SBR for NBFCs segregates them into four layers, not two, based on their size, activity, and perceived risk level. This differentiated approach allows for tailored regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Each tier under the SBR is subject to *different* regulatory requirements. The regulatory intensity increases with the tier, reflecting the higher risk profile of larger and more complex NBFCs.  The differentiation is a core principle of the SBR.


**12. With reference to  Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CRAs provide opinions on past debt repayments by borrowers.
2. CRAs in India are solely regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CRAs provide forward-looking opinions on the ability of an entity to meet its financial commitments (credit risk), not assessments of past performance. Credit bureaus provide information on past debt repayments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  In India, CRAs are primarily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), not the RBI.  This reflects their role in the securities market.



**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s regulatory framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs, irrespective of their asset size, are mandated to be members of at least one Credit Information Company (CIC) registered with the RBI.
2.  The RBI regulates all types of NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies, Merchant Bankers, and Chit Fund Companies.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RBI's regulations specify that only certain NBFCs (those with an asset size of ₹100 crore and above, and those acting as Payment System Participants or Credit Information Companies) are subject to the membership requirement with a CIC.  Smaller NBFCs are not necessarily under this mandate. The text explicitly states that the requirement applies to NBFCs (except Housing Finance Companies) with assets of ₹100 crore and above, plus Payment System Participants and CICs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RBI plays a significant role in regulating NBFCs, it does not regulate all types. The text itself clarifies that different regulatory bodies oversee various NBFC sub-sectors.  For instance, Housing Finance Companies are regulated by the National Housing Bank, Merchant Bankers and Venture Capital Funds by SEBI, Insurance companies by IRDAI, Chit Fund Companies by State Governments, and Nidhi Companies by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The RBI's jurisdiction is specific and does not encompass all NBFC categories.  The question attempts to create confusion by implying a broader, incorrect scope of RBI's power over all NBFC types.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the RBI's Omnibus Framework for recognising Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs):**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to ensure its financial viability and independence.
2.  The RBI's framework mandates that at least one-third of the members of an SRO's Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent to maintain robust governance.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI framework explicitly states that an SRO must be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. This is a crucial aspect of the framework, ensuring that the SRO's primary focus is on the benefit of its members and the sector, rather than profit maximization.  The question tries to mislead by incorrectly stating "for-profit".

Statement 2 is correct. The RBI's framework for SROs emphasizes the importance of independent oversight. It mandates that at least one-third of the members of the Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent. This provision safeguards against potential conflicts of interest and ensures objective decision-making within the SRO.  This is a key element in establishing strong governance.


**3. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will be implemented from April 1, 2024, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. All UCBs, including those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID), are subject to the new PCA framework.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that the new PCA framework will be effective from April 1, 2025, not 2024. This seemingly minor detail is a crucial distractor in the question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that the PCA framework applies to all UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, *except* those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  The question attempts to create confusion by falsely implying all UCBs are included.  This highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the scope of the regulations.


**4.  With reference to the RBI's management of its surplus, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of the RBI's entire net interest income to the central government.
2.  The Economic Capital Framework (ECF), as determined by the Bimal Jalan Committee, dictates that surplus transfers to the government are solely based on the realized equity of the RBI.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RBI Act, 1934, mandates the transfer of the RBI's *profits* to the central government, not its entire net interest income.  A significant portion of the net interest income contributes to the RBI's operational expenses and reserves. The question uses a subtle but crucial misrepresentation of the actual regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Economic Capital Framework (ECF) does not solely rely on realized equity for determining surplus transfers.  It also considers the economic capital (CGRA), which includes capital, reserves, and unrealized gains or losses. Both realized equity and economic capital are assessed to determine the appropriate amount to be transferred to the government.  The question simplifies a complex process to create a misleading statement.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India:**

1. All seven CRAs registered with SEBI are accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions for rating bank loan/facilities.
2.  SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs must disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy, but not guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While six of the seven CRAs registered with SEBI are accredited by the RBI, Brickwork Ratings is explicitly mentioned as an exception.  The question tries to create a false sense of completeness by ignoring this crucial exception.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that SEBI regulations require CRAs to disclose their rating criteria, methodology, default recognition policy, *and* guidelines on dealing with conflicts of interest. The question omits this crucial aspect of the regulatory framework, aiming to confuse the candidate.


**1. With reference to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) oversight of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All NBFCs, except Housing Finance Companies, with assets exceeding ₹100 crore and either accepting deposits or having customer interfaces, fall under RBI's purview.
2.  The RBI's authority over NBFCs extends to their management, governance, and winding-up procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the RBI's regulatory framework for NBFCs.  Statement 1 correctly identifies a key threshold for RBI's oversight: NBFCs (excluding Housing Finance Companies) with assets exceeding ₹100 crore and engaging in deposit acceptance or direct customer interaction are subject to RBI regulation. This reflects a risk-based approach, focusing on larger entities with greater potential impact on the financial system.  Statement 2 is also correct; the RBI's regulatory powers encompass the entire lifecycle of an NBFC, including its management structure, governance practices, and the procedures for its eventual dissolution or winding-up. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure the stability and soundness of the NBFC sector. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incomplete, and option (d) is entirely incorrect.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the RBI's Ombudsman Scheme:**

1.  The RBI may appoint Ombudsmen and Deputy Ombudsmen for a term not exceeding five years.
2.  The redressal of complaints under the scheme is currently managed by 24 RBI Ombudsman Offices (ORBIOs) and a Centralized Receipt and Processing Centre (CRPC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text specifies that the tenure of Ombudsmen and Deputy Ombudsmen is a maximum of three years, not five. This shorter tenure likely aims to ensure fresh perspectives and prevent potential entrenchment within the grievance redressal system. Statement 2, however, is accurate. The description clearly states that the RBI Ombudsman Scheme's complaint handling mechanism involves 24 ORBIOs and a CRPC. This decentralized yet coordinated structure facilitates efficient processing and resolution of customer complaints across different regions and entities.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate choice. Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**3. With reference to the Omnibus Framework for recognizing Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs) for Regulated Entities (REs), consider the following statements:**

1.  An SRO must be a for-profit company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be eligible for recognition by the RBI.
2.  The governance framework for SROs mandates that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, must be independent members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The framework explicitly states that an eligible SRO must be a *not-for-profit* company registered under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013. This stipulation ensures that the SRO's primary focus remains on serving the interests of its members and the sector, rather than profit maximization. Statement 2, however, is accurate. The RBI's framework mandates independent representation on the SRO's governing body, requiring at least one-third of the Board of Directors, including the Chairperson, to be independent. This requirement is crucial for ensuring robust governance, impartiality, and preventing conflicts of interest.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**4.  Consider the following statements concerning the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC):**

1.  NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  One of NUCFDC's major functions is to provide liquidity and capital support to Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), including raising capital and offering fund management services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that NUCFDC is registered as a Type II NBFC-ND, not Type I.  The distinction is significant as Type II NBFC-NDs accept public funds or have a customer interface, indicating a higher level of regulatory scrutiny. Statement 2 accurately describes a core function of NUCFDC: providing liquidity and capital support to UCBs. This includes raising capital (with a target of ₹300 crore mentioned) and offering fund management and consultancy services. This support is critical for strengthening the financial health and operational efficiency of UCBs. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**5. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCA framework for UCBs will be implemented from April 1, 2026, replacing the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF).
2. The framework applies to all UCBs in tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4 categories, except those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The implementation date of the PCA framework is stated as April 1, 2025, not 2026. This highlights the RBI's proactive approach to addressing the financial health of UCBs. Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that the framework's application excludes UCBs under All-Inclusive Directions (AID), while covering UCBs categorized as tier 2, 3, and 4. This targeted approach ensures that the PCA framework is applied appropriately based on the risk profiles of different UCBs. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1's implementation date.


**6. With reference to the Financial Inclusion Index (FI-Index), consider the following statements:**

1. The FI-Index is a single-value index ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing complete financial exclusion and 0 representing full financial inclusion.
2. The FI-Index incorporates data from banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the FI-Index clearly states that 0 represents complete exclusion and 100 represents full inclusion—the opposite of what statement 1 claims.  This seemingly minor detail is crucial for understanding the index's interpretation. Statement 2 is accurate. The index's comprehensive nature is emphasized by its inclusion of data across multiple financial sectors: banking, investments, insurance, postal services, and pensions. This broad scope provides a more holistic view of financial inclusion. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the reversal of the index's scale in statement 1.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council:**

1. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279B of the Constitution.
2.  Decisions within the GST Council require a three-fourths majority of the weighted votes, with states collectively holding a two-thirds voting weight and the Centre holding one-third.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is established under Article 279A, not 279B, of the Constitution. This seemingly minor difference in article number is a significant detail for understanding the constitutional basis of the council's authority. Statement 2, however, correctly describes the council's decision-making process, emphasizing the weighted voting system that balances the interests of both the central and state governments.  The two-thirds weight for states and one-third for the Centre accurately reflects the federal structure of India's governance. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the error in the article number cited in statement 1.


**8. With reference to the GST Appellate Tribunal, consider the following statements:**

1. The GST Appellate Tribunal is a first appellate authority established under the Central GST (CGST) Act, 2017.
2. The Principal Bench of the GST Appellate Tribunal is located in Mumbai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the GST Appellate Tribunal serves as a *second* appellate authority, not a first appellate authority. This distinction is crucial in understanding its place within the GST dispute resolution mechanism. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text specifies that the Principal Bench is located in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  This geographical detail is important for understanding the tribunal's organizational structure and accessibility. Because both statements are incorrect, (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual errors.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding Excise Duty in India:**

1.  Excise duty on petroleum products is collected by the State Governments.
2.  Prior to the introduction of GST, Central Excise Duty was levied on all goods manufactured in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage specifies that excise duty on petroleum products (and liquor) is collected by the Central Government, not State Governments. This distinction is key to understanding the division of tax revenue between the Centre and the states. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Central Excise Duty was a significant indirect tax before GST, it did not apply to *all* goods manufactured in India.  Certain goods or sectors might have been exempt or subject to different types of indirect taxes.  Therefore, both statements are factually inaccurate, making (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements.


**10. With reference to the Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1. IDS refers to a situation where import duties on finished goods are higher than on input goods.
2.  IDS creates working capital issues for taxpayers due to Input Tax Credit (ITC) remaining blocked.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition of IDS clearly states that the import duties (or GST rates in the domestic context) on *input* goods are higher than on *finished* goods, not the other way around. This inverted relationship is the core characteristic of IDS. Statement 2 accurately describes one of the key negative consequences of IDS: it leads to working capital issues because the higher tax paid on inputs results in a blocked ITC, tying up the taxpayer's resources. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 misrepresents the definition of IDS.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the amendment to the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provision on immovable properties:**

1. The amendment abolishes indexation benefits for properties acquired after July 23, 2024.
2. The amendment introduces a grandfather clause, allowing indexation benefits for properties acquired before July 23, 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendment does abolish indexation benefits for properties acquired *after* July 23, 2024. This change aims to simplify the tax calculation and potentially broaden the tax base. Statement 2 is incorrect. The grandfather clause applies to properties acquired before July 23, 2024 (not 2023), allowing those transactions to retain the benefit of indexation despite the new rules.  The difference in the year is a critical detail. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the error in the cut-off date in statement 2.


**12. With reference to the RBI's revised Non-Performing Asset (NPA) provisioning norms for cooperative banks, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cooperative banks are required to allocate net profits to the Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR) only after complying with IRACP norms and other regulations.
2.  Under the revised norms, provisions for BDDR under IRACP norms must be charged as an expense to the balance sheet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The revised norms stipulate that cooperative banks must first meet the requirements of the Income Recognition, Asset Classification, and Provisioning (IRACP) norms and other regulations before allocating net profits to the BDDR. This sequential approach ensures that provisions are made for potential losses before distributing profits. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that provisions for BDDR under IRACP norms must be charged as an expense to the *Profit and Loss Account*, not the balance sheet. This distinction is important in accounting practices. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 2 misstates where the BDDR expense is recorded.


**13.  With reference to co-lending arrangements between banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Banks are permitted to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group.
2.  As per RBI guidelines, a minimum of 20% credit risk in co-lending arrangements must be borne by the NBFC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that banks are *not* allowed to enter into co-lending arrangements with NBFCs belonging to their promoter group. This restriction is designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and enhance the integrity of the co-lending model. Statement 2 is correct. The RBI guidelines mandate that NBFCs bear a minimum of 20% of the credit risk in co-lending arrangements. This risk-sharing mechanism ensures that NBFCs have a significant stake in the success of the loan and encourages responsible lending practices. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 misrepresents the RBI's restrictions on co-lending arrangements.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding Wilful Defaulters (WDs):**

1.  An individual is classified as a WD only if the outstanding amount is ₹50 lakh or more.
2.  The RBI's directions on the treatment of WDs are issued under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the threshold for classification as a WD is ₹25 lakh and above, not ₹50 lakh. This lower threshold broadens the scope of the WD classification. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RBI's directions on WDs are issued under the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005—not the SARFAESI Act, 2002.  These multiple acts reflect the multi-faceted nature of the regulatory framework for dealing with WDs. Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements.


**15. With reference to Primary Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  A UCB must have at least one hundred members to meet the criteria for registration.
2.  UCBs are permitted to accept deposits from and lend to non-members for their mutual benefit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that a UCB must have at least *two hundred* members, not one hundred, to fulfill the registration criteria. This higher minimum membership requirement reflects the scale and scope of operations expected from UCBs. Statement 2 is also incorrect. UCBs are explicitly defined as institutions that deal with their *members only* for mutual benefit, excluding non-members from their operations.  This restriction is fundamental to the cooperative nature of UCBs. Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements.


**16. Consider the following statements concerning the ISI Mark:**

1. The ISI Mark is mandatory for all products sold in India.
2. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is responsible for developing and issuing the ISI Mark.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ISI Mark is not mandatory for *all* products sold in India; it is mandatory only for certain specified products as determined by the government through Quality Control Orders (QCOs). This targeted approach focuses on products where quality and safety are paramount. Statement 2 is correct. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is indeed responsible for developing and issuing the ISI Mark. This reflects the BIS's role as the national standards body of India.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because statement 1 incorrectly states the scope of the ISI Mark's mandatory application.


**17. With reference to the Pre-Packaged Insolvency Resolution Process (PPIRP), consider the following statements:**

1. PPIRP is available for defaults of at least ₹5 lakh.
2.  PPIRP is required to be completed within a period of 90 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that PPIRP is available for defaults of at least ₹10 lakh, not ₹5 lakh. This higher threshold reflects the scale of defaults that trigger the PPIRP process. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The timeframe for completing PPIRP is 120 days, not 90 days. This longer timeframe allows for a more thorough and comprehensive resolution process. Therefore, both statements are inaccurate, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect due to the numerical errors in both statements.


**18. Consider the following statements about Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs):**

1. ARCs are required to resolve the assets within a maximum of 5 years of acquisition.
2.  The Narasimham Committee I (1991) proposed the establishment of ARCs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that ARCs have a maximum of 8 years to resolve acquired assets, not 5 years. This longer timeframe acknowledges the complexities involved in resolving stressed assets.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text correctly attributes the proposal for ARCs to the Narasimham Committee II (1998), not Committee I (1991). This difference in committee and year is crucial for understanding the historical context of ARC development.  Therefore, both statements are factually incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect due to the errors in both statements.


**19. With reference to Credit Rating Agencies (CRAs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI as External Credit Assessment Institutions.
2.  SEBI regulations mandate that CRAs must disclose their rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While several CRAs registered with SEBI are also accredited by the RBI, this is not true for *all* of them.  The text specifically notes that only six of the seven CRAs registered with SEBI are RBI-accredited. This highlights the nuanced relationship between different regulatory bodies. Statement 2 is correct. SEBI regulations do indeed mandate the disclosure of rating criteria, methodology, and default recognition policies by CRAs. This transparency requirement is crucial for maintaining the credibility and integrity of credit ratings. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1.


**20.  Consider the following statements regarding Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs):**

1. InvITs are exclusively permitted to issue subordinate units to institutional investors.
2.  Sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that privately placed InvITs are allowed to issue subordinate units to sponsors only, not exclusively to institutional investors.  This distinction is important for understanding the flexibility within the InvIT regulatory framework. Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately notes that sponsors of InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. This legal recognition facilitates the financing and operation of infrastructure projects under the InvIT structure. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the limitation on the issuance of subordinate units mentioned in statement 1.



**1. With reference to the Geographical Indications Act 1999, consider the following statements:**

1.  It grants individual rights over traditional knowledge related to specific products.
2.  It primarily focuses on protecting the geographical origin of goods and the reputation associated with them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Geographical Indications Act, 1999, aims to protect the unique identity and reputation of goods linked to a specific geographical region.  It grants collective rights, not individual rights, to producers associated with that region. This protection is based on the distinctive qualities and reputation of the product, which are intrinsically linked to its origin.  Statement 1 is incorrect because individual rights are not the focus; collective rights of producers within a geographical area are protected. Statement 2 accurately reflects the Act's core purpose: safeguarding the geographical origin and associated reputation of goods.  The Act ensures that only products originating from the specified region can use the GI tag, preventing others from misrepresenting their products' origin and potentially exploiting the established reputation.  This protection enhances market value and fosters economic development for producers in the designated area.


**2. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is primarily focused on developing India's digital infrastructure.
2.  It integrates data from various ministries and agencies to facilitate infrastructure project planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) is a comprehensive initiative aimed at improving infrastructure development in India.  While it utilizes a digital platform and GIS technology for planning, its core function is not solely focused on digital infrastructure development (statement 1 is incorrect).  The plan's strength lies in its integrative approach, bringing together data from various ministries and agencies involved in infrastructure projects.  This integrated approach enables better coordination and efficient planning, reducing duplication and conflicts between different projects.  Statement 2 correctly highlights this key feature of the PMGS NMP, facilitating a holistic and coordinated approach to infrastructure development across various sectors like railways, roads, ports, and waterways. The use of open-source technology and integration with ISRO satellite imagery further strengthens its capabilities.


**3. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Economic Affairs is solely responsible for the implementation of all PPP projects.
2.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in the PPP framework, but it is not solely responsible for the implementation of all projects.  Implementation involves various agencies at the central and state levels. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, not just state-level ones. State governments have their own appraisal mechanisms. Thus, statement 2 is also incorrect.  The PPP framework in India involves a multi-layered approach with the central government setting policy guidelines and providing oversight, while states and implementing agencies manage individual projects.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is another key initiative that complements the PPP framework by attracting private investment in existing government assets.


**4. With reference to the GST Council, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a non-constitutional body established through a simple majority vote in Parliament.
2.  The Union Finance Minister holds the position of Chairperson and has a weighted vote that outweighs all state votes combined.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GST Council is a crucial constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Constitution through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it is a constitutional body, not a non-constitutional one, and its formation required a constitutional amendment process, not a simple majority vote.  The Union Finance Minister chairs the council, but the voting structure doesn't give the Centre a disproportionate power.  States collectively hold a two-thirds voting weight, while the Centre holds one-third.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect. A three-fourths majority is required for decisions, ensuring that states have a significant voice in shaping GST policy.  This structure reflects the federal nature of India's governance, balancing central and state interests in tax matters.


**5. With reference to the GST Appellate Tribunal, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is the first appellate authority for disputes related to GST.
2.  The President of the Principal Bench is appointed by the government without consultation with the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GST Appellate Tribunal acts as a second appellate authority, not the first.  Appeals against orders from the Appellate Authority under the CGST Act, 2017, and State GST Acts are heard by the GST Appellate Tribunal.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The appointment of the President of the Principal Bench involves consultation with the Chief Justice of India or their nominee, highlighting the importance of judicial independence and expertise in the tribunal's functioning.  Hence, statement 2 is also incorrect.  The tribunal's structure, with a Principal Bench and various State Benches, ensures that appeals are handled efficiently across the country. The three-year tenure or age limit of 70 years for the President ensures a balance between experience and fresh perspectives.


**6. With reference to Excise Duty in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Excise duty is levied only on goods imported into India.
2.  Post-GST implementation, excise duty is no longer levied on most goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Excise duty is an indirect tax levied on goods manufactured within India for domestic consumption, not on imported goods (customs duty applies to imports). Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) subsumed many types of excise duty, significantly altering the tax structure.  Currently, excise duty primarily applies to petroleum products and alcoholic beverages. State governments collect excise duty on alcohol. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The shift from the earlier Central Excise Duty to GST aimed at simplifying the tax system and creating a unified indirect tax structure across the country. The exceptions for petroleum and alcohol reflect the complex revenue considerations associated with these sectors.


**7. With reference to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), consider the following statements:**

1.  It is responsible for the administration of indirect tax laws.
2.  It functions under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CBDT is responsible for the administration of direct tax laws, primarily through the Income Tax Department. It does not handle indirect tax laws, which fall under the purview of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The CBDT operates under the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.  This organizational structure reflects the government's approach to tax administration, with distinct bodies handling direct and indirect taxes. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The CBDT's functions include policy formulation, implementation of tax laws, taxpayer services, and enforcement actions to ensure compliance with tax regulations.


**8. With reference to Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  DTAAs primarily aim to increase the tax burden on foreign investors.
2.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a mechanism for resolving double taxation disputes arising from DTAAs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DTAAs are designed to reduce, not increase, the tax burden on foreign investors by preventing double taxation of the same income in two different countries.  This encourages cross-border investment and promotes economic cooperation. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) is a crucial mechanism within DTAAs that provides an avenue for resolving double taxation disputes between countries.  Taxpayers can utilize the MAP process to seek a resolution when faced with conflicting interpretations of the DTAA or other double taxation issues. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The MAP process usually involves negotiations between the tax authorities of the two countries involved, aiming for a mutually acceptable solution.


**9. With reference to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  BEPS primarily targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to prevent tax avoidance.
2.  The Principal Purpose Test (PPT) is a key measure introduced to counter BEPS strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The BEPS initiative primarily focuses on multinational enterprises (MNEs), not SMEs, to address aggressive tax planning strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Principal Purpose Test (PPT) is a significant measure introduced under the BEPS initiative to counter tax avoidance strategies.  The PPT examines the main purpose of a transaction to determine whether it qualifies for tax benefits under a DTAA, preventing the artificial shifting of profits to low-tax jurisdictions.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The BEPS initiative, involving the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework, aims to create a more level playing field for businesses and ensure that MNEs pay their fair share of taxes globally.


**10. With reference to the National Urban Cooperative Finance and Development Corporation Limited (NUCFDC), consider the following statements:**

1.  It is registered with the RBI as a Type I Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND).
2.  It primarily focuses on providing direct loans to individual borrowers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NUCFDC is registered with the RBI as a Type II Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC-ND), not Type I. Type II NBFCs accept public deposits or have customer interfaces, reflecting NUCFDC's role in supporting urban cooperative banks.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The NUCFDC's main function is not to provide direct loans to individual borrowers; it acts as an umbrella organization for urban cooperative banks (UCBs), providing support in areas like liquidity, capital, regulatory compliance, and technology.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  Its role is to strengthen the UCB sector as a whole, enhancing its stability and efficiency.  The NUCFDC aims to improve the overall financial health and operational capacity of UCBs, indirectly benefiting individual borrowers through a more robust banking system.


**11. With reference to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for Primary Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), consider the following statements:**

1.  It is applicable to all UCBs regardless of their size or financial health.
2.  It will replace the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) effective from April 1, 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PCA framework for UCBs is not applicable to all UCBs indiscriminately; it targets UCBs in specific tier categories (tier 2, tier 3, and tier 4) and excludes those under All-Inclusive Directions (AID).  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The implementation of the new PCA framework is effective from April 1, 2025, not April 1, 2024.  It replaces the existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF). Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  The PCA framework aims to address the financial health of UCBs with greater precision and flexibility, providing a more targeted and adaptable approach to supervision and intervention.  The key monitoring areas are capital, asset quality, and profitability of the UCBs.


**12. With reference to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ARCs are primarily responsible for lending money to businesses facing financial distress.
2.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, mandates that ARCs be registered and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ARCs are not involved in lending; their core function is to acquire Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) from banks and financial institutions to help clean up bank balance sheets.  They aim to resolve stressed assets and help banks focus on their core lending function.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The SARFAESI Act, 2002, mandates that ARCs be registered and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not SEBI.  Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.  ARCs play a vital role in the Indian financial system by facilitating asset recovery, resolving stressed assets, and reviving businesses by restructuring loans.  The Narasimham Committee II (1998) first proposed the establishment of ARCs in India.


**13. With reference to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IBC primarily aims to liquidate all distressed businesses quickly, regardless of their viability.
2.  Information Utilities (IUs) play a significant role in gathering and disseminating financial information for the insolvency resolution process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IBC's objective is not solely to liquidate businesses; it aims to promote a time-bound resolution process, prioritizing resolution over immediate liquidation whenever possible.  It seeks to improve recovery rates for creditors and provide an exit mechanism for distressed companies, focusing on maximizing value for stakeholders. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Information Utilities (IUs) are integral to the IBC process, collecting, authenticating, and disseminating financial information about companies.  This information is crucial for insolvency professionals, creditors, and other stakeholders involved in the resolution process.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The IBC framework comprises various key players, including insolvency professionals (IPs), adjudicating authorities (AAs), and appellate tribunals, all working together to ensure a fair and efficient insolvency resolution process.


**14. With reference to the Monetary Policy of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's monetary policy primarily focuses on controlling the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee against other currencies.
2.  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) determines the inflation target every five years in consultation with the Central Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the RBI's monetary policy indirectly influences the exchange rate, its primary objective is to achieve sustainable economic growth and maintain price stability by adjusting the money supply.  The exchange rate is a factor considered, but not the sole focus.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Central Government, in consultation with the RBI, determines the inflation target (currently 4% with a tolerance band of +/- 2%) every five years, which the MPC then strives to achieve through its monetary policy decisions.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The RBI uses various tools to implement monetary policy, including policy rate changes, open market operations (OMOs), cash reserve ratio (CRR), and others.  The framework is based on flexible inflation targeting.


**15. With reference to Inverted Duty Structure (IDS), consider the following statements:**

1.  IDS refers to a situation where the GST rate on finished goods is higher than the GST rate on input goods.
2.  IDS typically leads to a build-up of Input Tax Credit (ITC) for taxpayers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

IDS is characterized by import duties or GST rates on input goods being higher than on finished goods, not the other way around. This creates a situation where the tax paid on purchases exceeds the tax payable on sales.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  When facing an inverted duty structure, taxpayers often have a higher Input Tax Credit (ITC) balance in their electronic credit ledger because they pay more tax on inputs than they collect on sales.  This can lead to working capital issues and refund-related problems.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  Addressing IDS is crucial for ensuring competitiveness of domestic industries and preventing distortions in the market.


**16. With reference to Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax provisions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Indexation benefits are always applicable to LTCG on immovable properties.
2.  The recent amendment abolishes indexation benefits for properties acquired after a specified cut-off date.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Indexation benefits on LTCG from immovable properties were not always applicable.  Recent amendments introduced changes to this provision. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  A recent amendment to the Finance Bill abolished indexation benefits for properties acquired after a specific cut-off date (July 23, 2024), but properties acquired before that date are grandfathered and retain the benefit.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The amendment aimed to rationalize the tax treatment of capital gains on immovable property, leading to changes in how LTCG is calculated and potentially affecting tax liabilities for taxpayers.  The grandfather clause protects those who acquired properties before the change.


**17. With reference to Duty Drawback, consider the following statements:**

1.  Duty Drawback is a mechanism to reduce the cost of imported raw materials used in the manufacture of export goods.
2.  Duty Drawback is disbursed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Duty Drawback rebates customs duty paid on imported materials or excisable materials used in manufacturing export goods, effectively reducing costs for exporters.  This promotes exports by offsetting some of the costs associated with using imported inputs. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Duty Drawback is disbursed by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), not the CBDT. The CBIC is responsible for customs and indirect tax matters, while CBDT handles direct taxes. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  The electronic disbursement of duty drawback amounts directly to exporters' bank accounts through the Public Finance Management System improves the efficiency of the process.


**18. With reference to Windfall Tax, consider the following statements:**

1.  Windfall tax is levied on all industries irrespective of their profit levels.
2.  Windfall tax is a temporary measure usually imposed during periods of unusually high profits in specific sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Windfall tax is not levied on all industries; it targets specific sectors experiencing exceptionally high profits due to favorable economic circumstances (e.g., unexpectedly high oil prices).  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Windfall taxes are typically temporary measures, imposed when specific industries enjoy windfall gains due to external factors, and are removed once those conditions change.  This approach aims to capture some of the extraordinary profits generated during such periods, often to fund social programs or reduce budget deficits. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.  The imposition and removal of windfall taxes are subject to government policy and economic conditions.


**1. With reference to the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The plan utilizes a Digital Master Planning tool developed by BISAG-N, employing a GIS platform and integrating ISRO satellite imagery.
2.  It exclusively focuses on the development of new infrastructure projects, neglecting the integration of existing infrastructure assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS NMP) indeed leverages a Digital Master Planning tool created by BISAG-N, incorporating GIS technology, ISRO satellite imagery, and Survey of India basemaps. This integrated approach is crucial for efficient planning and execution of infrastructure projects.  The use of open-source technology hosted on Meghraj (Government of India’s cloud) further underscores the plan's commitment to transparency and accessibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan's core objective is not solely about developing new infrastructure.  It aims for holistic development, integrating existing infrastructure assets with planned projects.  This integrated approach is vital for optimizing resource allocation and minimizing redundancy. The plan encompasses a comprehensive database of ongoing and future projects from various ministries, including those related to Bharatmala, Sagarmala, inland waterways, dry/land ports, and UDAN, demonstrating its focus on a unified and comprehensive infrastructure development strategy.  Ignoring existing assets would be a significant oversight in a plan aiming for national-scale logistical efficiency.


**2. With reference to Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates only state-level PPP projects.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by monetising existing government assets, primarily focusing on the energy sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates *central sector* PPP projects, not solely state-level ones.  The scope of the committee's appraisal extends to projects undertaken by the central government, reflecting its role in overseeing major national infrastructure initiatives. State-level PPP projects fall under the purview of respective state-level committees or authorities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) does aim to generate investment through the monetisation of existing government assets targeting ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), its scope is not limited to the energy sector. The NMP encompasses a broader range of assets across various sectors, including infrastructure, aiming for a diversified investment portfolio.  Focusing solely on the energy sector would overlook opportunities for monetization and investment in other crucial areas.


**3. With reference to the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement has been fully ratified by all WTO member countries and is currently in effect.
2.  India has actively supported the agreement and is a signatory to it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, while adopted, has not yet been fully ratified by all WTO member countries and is therefore not yet fully in effect.  It requires acceptance from two-thirds of WTO members, a threshold that has not yet been reached. The agreement's implementation hinges upon the consensus and ratification of a sufficient number of member states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is *not* a part of the agreement.  India has expressed concerns about the agreement's potential impact on its fishing industry and has raised specific demands regarding special and differential treatment for developing countries and the need for greater responsibility from historically large subsidizing nations.  These concerns highlight the complexities and diverse interests involved in international trade agreements related to resource management.


**4. With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement was established after the formation of the WTO.
2. The agreement sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection for all member countries, thereby ensuring uniform protection across all nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) was developed during the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and became one of the main annexes to the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO.  It came into force on January 1, 1995, which is *after* the WTO's establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the TRIPS Agreement sets *minimum* standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, it doesn't ensure perfectly uniform protection across all nations.  The agreement allows for some flexibility in implementation, reflecting the diverse legal and economic contexts of member countries.  The minimum standards aim to establish a baseline level of protection, but individual countries may choose to provide higher levels of protection based on their national laws and policies.


**5. With reference to India’s offshore mineral resources, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  Geological Survey of India has identified significant deposits of polymetallic nodules and crusts primarily in the Bay of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.  This exclusion reflects the separate regulatory frameworks governing these specific resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Geological Survey of India has indeed delineated resources of polymetallic nodules and crusts in Indian offshore areas, these deposits are primarily located in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not the Bay of Bengal.  The geographical distribution of these resources is a crucial factor in planning exploration and extraction activities.


**6. With reference to the Agreement on Agriculture within the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement on Agriculture mandates the complete elimination of all export subsidies by all member countries.
2. The "peace clause" provides a permanent solution to the issue of Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Agreement on Agriculture aims to reduce trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies, it doesn't mandate the complete elimination of all export subsidies by all member countries.  The Nairobi Ministerial Decision of 2015 did lead to the elimination of export subsidies by developed members, but exceptions and transitional periods exist, reflecting the complexities of agricultural trade policies and the varying capacities of different nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "peace clause" agreed upon at the 9th Ministerial Conference (MC9) in Bali serves as an *interim* solution for Public Stockholding (PSH) for food security, not a permanent one.  The peace clause aims to provide temporary protection from WTO disputes related to PSH programs, while negotiations continue on a long-term solution.  India, for instance, continues to advocate for a permanent solution that would legitimize higher subsidies for food stockholding programs.


**7. With reference to the Internationalization of the Indian Rupee, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Rupee is fully convertible in both the current and capital accounts.
2. The inclusion of the INR in the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system has significantly reduced transaction costs for international trade involving the Rupee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Rupee (INR) is fully convertible in the current account, meaning that transactions related to trade in goods and services are freely allowed. However, it is only partially convertible in the capital account, which means there are restrictions on transactions related to capital flows, such as foreign direct investment or portfolio investments.  These restrictions are imposed to manage capital flows and maintain macroeconomic stability.

Statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of the INR in the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system has indeed facilitated smoother and more efficient international transactions involving the Rupee.  CLS is a crucial system for settling foreign currency transactions, and its adoption helps reduce settlement risk and transaction costs. This step contributes to greater use of the Rupee in international trade and finance.


**8. With reference to the IMF and World Bank lending mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMF primarily lends for specific development projects, similar to the World Bank.
2. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform aims to reduce the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IMF's lending is distinct from the World Bank's. The IMF provides financial support to countries facing economic crises, offering lending instruments like the General Resources Account (GRA), Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), and Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).  Unlike the World Bank, which provides loans for specific development projects, the IMF's lending is not project-specific; it addresses broader macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Bank Group Guarantee Platform (WBG-GP) was launched to *increase*, not reduce, the World Bank's annual guarantee issuance.  The platform aims to streamline and consolidate guarantee products and expertise to boost annual guarantee issuance to $20 billion by 2030. This reflects the World Bank's commitment to mobilizing private sector investment in development projects, particularly those involving significant risks.


**9. With reference to Seaweed Farming in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana aims to achieve a seaweed production target of 5 million tonnes per year by 2025.
2.  Seaweed cultivation is primarily undertaken in inland water bodies such as lakes and rivers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojana's target for seaweed production is 1 million tonnes per year by 2025, not 5 million tonnes.  This ambitious target reflects India's growing interest in seaweed cultivation's economic and environmental benefits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While seaweed can grow in various water bodies, its cultivation in India is predominantly focused on *offshore* areas, utilizing coastal marine environments.  This approach maximizes the potential for large-scale cultivation and leverages the natural conditions conducive to seaweed growth. Inland water bodies are not the primary focus for large-scale seaweed farming initiatives.


**10. With reference to the Indian Silk Sector, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the world's largest producer of silk, accounting for over 50% of global production.
2.  The Central Silk Board recently celebrated its diamond jubilee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is the *second* largest producer of silk globally, not the largest.  While India holds a significant share of global silk production (approximately 42% in 2023), China maintains its position as the world's leading silk producer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Central Silk Board celebrated its *platinum* jubilee, not its diamond jubilee.  The platinum jubilee marks 75 years of the board's existence and contribution to the Indian silk industry.  The distinction between platinum and diamond jubilees highlights the importance of accurate factual recall in understanding historical milestones.


**1. With reference to deep-sea mining in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, apply to all minerals, including mineral oils and hydrocarbons.
2.  Geological Survey of India has identified significant reserves of polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts in the Bay of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Offshore Areas (Existence of Mineral Resources) Rules, 2024, explicitly exclude mineral oils, hydrocarbons, and minerals specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Mines & Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, from their applicability.  This exclusion highlights the specific regulatory framework governing these resources, distinct from the rules focused on other offshore minerals.  The rules aim to provide a comprehensive yet targeted approach to the exploration and development of deep-sea minerals, excluding those already under separate legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Geological Survey of India has indeed delineated polymetallic ferromanganese nodules and crusts in offshore areas,  the text specifies these are found in the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea, not the Bay of Bengal. This distinction is crucial; the geographical location of these mineral deposits directly impacts exploration strategies and resource management.  The precise location of mineral reserves is a key element in resource assessment and planning for extraction.  Confusing the Andaman Sea and Lakshadweep Sea with the Bay of Bengal demonstrates a lack of precise geographical knowledge, a common weakness in UPSC-style questions.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's steel sector:**

1. India's per capita finished steel consumption exceeds the global average.
2.  The Indian steel industry's reliance on imported coking coal significantly increases its production costs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that India's per capita finished steel consumption in 2023-24 was 97.7 kg, considerably lower than the world average of 219.3 kg. This significant gap highlights India's relatively lower steel consumption per person compared to global benchmarks.  The disparity underscores the need for increased domestic demand and infrastructure development to boost steel consumption.  This statement acts as a distractor, playing on the general perception of India's rapid economic growth.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that India heavily relies on costly imports of coking coal from Australia to meet its needs. This dependence on imports exposes the Indian steel industry to volatile international coal prices, increasing production costs and impacting the sector's competitiveness. The reliance on imports is a major challenge, making the sector vulnerable to global market fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.  Understanding this vulnerability is crucial for analyzing the sector's economic health and formulating appropriate policies.


**3. With reference to India's asset monetization initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) primarily focuses on greenfield infrastructure projects.
2. The Viability Gap Funding Scheme (VGF) provides financial assistance to enhance the viability of public-private partnership (PPP) projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMP explicitly targets the monetization of *brownfield* infrastructure assets—existing government-owned assets—to generate revenue and investment.  The focus on brownfield assets distinguishes the NMP from initiatives that concentrate on new projects. This detail is critical for comprehending the NMP's strategic objectives and its role in unlocking the value of existing infrastructure.  The use of "greenfield" as a distractor highlights the need for precise understanding of terminology in this context.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the VGF as a scheme that provides up to 40% of project costs as a capital grant to improve the financial attractiveness of PPP projects.  This support is crucial in mitigating risks and attracting private sector investment in infrastructure development.

2.  The Agreement on Agriculture, negotiated during the Uruguay Round and finalized in Marrakesh, introduced the concept of “tariffication,” mandating the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, and established different subsidy categories based on their trade-distorting effects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994 by 123 countries, concluded the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations.  A key outcome was the establishment of the WTO in 1995, replacing GATT as the primary global trade body.  The agreement significantly broadened the scope of international trade rules beyond just goods, incorporating services, intellectual property rights, and investment-related aspects. This expansion reflected the growing importance of these sectors in the global economy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), a crucial component of the Marrakesh Agreement, aimed to reform agricultural trade policies.  A core element of the AoA was the principle of "tariffication," requiring countries to convert non-tariff barriers (like quotas and variable levies) into tariffs.  This measure aimed to create a more transparent and predictable trading environment for agricultural products.  Furthermore, the AoA categorized agricultural subsidies based on their potential to distort trade, using the "Green Box," "Amber Box," and "Blue Box" classifications to distinguish between permissible and prohibited forms of support.  Understanding these boxes is crucial for analyzing agricultural trade policies within the WTO framework.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Marrakesh Agreement and its impact on global trade.


**2. With reference to India's Public Stockholding (PSH) policy and its implications within the WTO framework, consider the following statements:**

1. India's PSH policy, which allows the government to procure crops at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) and distribute them to the poor, has faced challenges within the WTO due to concerns from developed countries that it distorts agricultural markets.
2. The WTO's de minimis limits on agricultural subsidies, currently calculated using a reference price from 1986-88, restrict the amount of support developing countries can provide to their farmers through price support programs, creating a point of contention between developing and developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's PSH policy, designed to ensure food security and support farmers by procuring crops at MSPs, has been a subject of debate within the WTO.  Developed countries argue that such policies distort agricultural markets by artificially inflating prices and creating unfair competition for their farmers.  This disagreement highlights the tension between the need for food security in developing nations and the WTO's rules aimed at promoting free and fair trade. The WTO's 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi demonstrated the ongoing difficulty in finding a permanent solution to this issue.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture imposes limits on agricultural subsidies, referred to as "de minimis" limits. These limits define the permissible level of support a country can provide to its farmers without triggering WTO dispute settlement procedures.  The current calculation of these limits, using a reference price from 1986-88, is criticized by developing countries as outdated and inadequate.  They argue that the formula does not reflect the increased costs of agricultural production and fails to account for the specific needs of their farmers.  This has led to ongoing negotiations and disagreements within the WTO regarding the appropriate level and calculation method for de minimis limits.  The discrepancy between the demands of developing nations for increased de minimis limits and the objections of developed countries underscores the complexities of agricultural trade negotiations within the WTO.


**3. With reference to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) framework in India and its associated initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Private Investment Unit within the Department of Economic Affairs plays a crucial role in formulating policies related to PPPs in India, while the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects.
2. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is a significant initiative aimed at attracting private investment by monetizing existing government assets, with a target of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years (FY22 to FY25), while the  Logistics Efficiency Enhancement Programme (LEEP) focuses on improving freight transport efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**2. With reference to the Minimum Support Price (MSP) mechanism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MSP is calculated by considering only the A2+FL cost of production, ignoring other crucial factors affecting farmers' profitability.
2. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) solely determines the final MSP for all crops, without any government oversight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CACP considers three types of production costs while calculating MSP: A2, A2+FL, and C2.  While A2+FL (Actual cost of production plus family labor) is a significant component, it is not the sole factor considered.  The CACP takes a comprehensive approach, factoring in various other aspects influencing farmer profitability.  The statement oversimplifies the MSP calculation process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CACP recommends the MSP, but the final decision rests with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The VRR is primarily used by the RBI to *inject* short-term liquidity into the banking system, not absorb excess liquidity.  The statement incorrectly describes the function of the VRR.  The Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) is the mechanism used to absorb excess liquidity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Increasing the CRR has the opposite effect; it *reduces* the liquidity available to banks as they are required to hold a larger portion of their deposits with the RBI.  This contractionary monetary policy measure can curb inflation but may also slow down economic growth.  The statement incorrectly describes the impact of CRR changes on liquidity and economic activity.


**6. With reference to the Horticulture sector in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by privatizing all existing government assets, thereby reducing the government's role in infrastructure.
2. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee evaluates central sector PPP projects, ensuring transparency and efficient allocation of resources.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) aims to generate investment by *monetizing* (not privatizing) existing government assets. This means leveraging the value of these assets to attract private investment without necessarily transferring ownership.  The government retains ownership but allows private entities to operate and manage the assets for a specific period, sharing in the revenue generated.  The government's role in infrastructure remains significant, though the mode of financing and management changes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee plays a crucial role in evaluating central sector PPP projects. Its function is to ensure that these projects are financially viable, technically sound, and aligned with the government's overall development objectives.  The committee's evaluation contributes to transparency and efficient resource allocation within the PPP framework, minimizing risks and maximizing benefits.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies aims to curb *harmful* subsidies that contribute to the depletion of fish stocks. It does not aim to eliminate all subsidies.  The agreement recognizes the importance of subsidies for developing countries and small economies to support their fisheries sectors and achieve sustainable development goals.  The agreement focuses on phasing out specific types of subsidies that are environmentally damaging, not a complete ban on all subsidies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that India is *not* a part of the agreement.  This highlights India's concerns regarding the agreement's provisions, particularly those related to the "polluter pays principle" and the need for special and differential treatment for developing countries.  India's position reflects its prioritization of its national interests and the specific challenges faced by its fisheries sector.


**4.  With reference to the TRIPS Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, allowing countries flexibility to exceed these minimum standards based on their specific needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TRIPS Agreement establishes minimum standards for intellectual property rights protection, but it doesn't prevent countries from implementing higher standards or adopting measures that go beyond these minimum requirements.  This flexibility allows countries to tailor their IPR regimes to their specific economic and social contexts.  The agreement aims to balance the interests of innovators with the broader public interest.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement explicitly affirms that the TRIPS Agreement does *not* and should *not* prevent members from taking measures to protect public health.

2.  Since 2011-12, private investment, a major component of GFCF, has continuously declined, posing a significant challenge to economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that from independence to economic liberalization, investment remained slightly *below/above* 10% of GDP. This indicates fluctuation around the 10% mark, not a consistent level below 10%.  The statement oversimplifies the complex dynamics of investment during this period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text notes a drop in private investment from around 27% of GDP in 2007-08 to a low of 19.6% in 2020-21, it also explicitly states that private investment *again started rising* after hitting that low.  The statement incorrectly presents a continuous decline as a persistent trend. The fluctuations in private investment highlight the cyclical nature of economic activity and the challenges of maintaining consistent high investment levels.


**6. With reference to the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF), consider the following statements:**

1. The EIF is a bilateral partnership focused exclusively on providing financial assistance to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to improve their trade infrastructure.
2.  The United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) serves as the EIF Trust Fund Manager, overseeing the allocation and utilization of resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EIF is a *multilateral* partnership, not a bilateral one. It involves multiple countries and international organizations working together to assist LDCs.  Its focus is broader than just financial assistance; it aims to use trade as an engine for growth, sustainable development, and poverty reduction in LDCs.  The framework encompasses technical assistance, capacity building, and policy support, in addition to financial resources.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNOPS is indeed the EIF Trust Fund Manager.  This reflects the importance of a reputable and experienced organization in overseeing the efficient and transparent management of the EIF's financial resources to ensure they are effectively utilized to achieve the framework's objectives.  UNOPS's role in managing the trust fund enhances the credibility and accountability of the EIF.

2. The establishment of the NCoE is a direct response to the 2022-23 budget announcements, reflecting the government's commitment to fostering growth in the AVGC-XR sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCoE will be set up as a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013. This means it will be a non-profit organization, not a government-owned and operated entity. This structure allows for greater flexibility and autonomy in managing the NCoE's operations while still aligning with the government's objectives for promoting the AVGC-XR sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The formation of the NCoE directly follows the 2022-23 budget announcements, which proposed the creation of an AVGC task force.

1. The amendments primarily aim to restrict foreign investment in Indian venture capital undertakings, protecting domestic businesses from foreign competition.
2.  A Foreign Venture Capital Investor (FVCI) is defined as an investor incorporated outside India and registered under the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, investing in venture capital funds or undertakings in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

It was established under the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development Act, 2021, and notified as a PFI under the Companies Act, 2013. The government's significant involvement highlights its role in supporting infrastructure development through dedicated financial institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. NaBFID's objective is to provide long-term, non-recourse infrastructure financing. This is crucial for attracting investment in large-scale infrastructure projects that typically require substantial upfront capital and extended periods for returns. The focus on non-recourse financing reduces the risk for investors and encourages participation in crucial infrastructure projects.  The development of relevant financial markets is key to creating a sustainable ecosystem for infrastructure financing.


**13. With reference to the Marrakesh Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, led to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO), replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2. The agreement primarily focused on regulating trade in manufactured goods, leaving the regulation of agricultural trade to separate bilateral agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Marrakesh Agreement, signed in 1994, was a landmark achievement in international trade negotiations. It established the WTO, expanding the scope of trade regulation beyond the GATT's focus on tariffs and encompassing services, intellectual property, and other aspects of international trade.  The WTO's establishment marked a significant shift towards a more comprehensive and integrated system of global trade governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Marrakesh Agreement expanded the scope of trade regulation to include not only manufactured goods but also agriculture, services, and intellectual property.  The Agreement on Agriculture, a crucial part of the Marrakesh Agreement, dealt specifically with trade-related issues in the agricultural sector.  The agreement established a multilateral framework for agricultural trade, moving away from reliance on bilateral agreements.


**14. With reference to the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Agreement on Agriculture's "Market Access" pillar requires the conversion of all non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs, a process known as tariffication.
2.  The Agreement on Agriculture's "Domestic Support" pillar strictly prohibits all forms of government subsidies in the agricultural sector, promoting fair competition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Market Access" pillar of the Agreement on Agriculture does indeed require the conversion of non-tariff barriers into equivalent tariffs (tariffication). This aims to create a more transparent and predictable system of agricultural trade by replacing less transparent non-tariff measures with clearly defined tariffs.  Tariffication is a key element in the WTO's efforts to liberalize agricultural trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Domestic Support" pillar of the Agreement on Agriculture does *not* prohibit all forms of government subsidies. It allows for certain types of subsidies within defined limits ("Green Box" and "Blue Box" subsidies) while restricting others ("Amber Box" subsidies).  The agreement aims to balance the need to support farmers with the objective of preventing trade-distorting subsidies.  The "de minimis" provision allows for a certain level of permissible subsidies, reflecting the complexities of agricultural policy and the varying needs of different countries.


**15. With reference to the Public Stockholding (PSH) policy and its implications under the WTO, consider the following statements:**

1. Developing countries advocate for increased de minimis limits for food subsidies, allowing them to maintain larger food stockholding programs without facing trade penalties.
2. Most developed countries support the unrestricted use of PSH by developing countries, recognizing its importance for food security and poverty reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Developing countries strongly advocate for higher de minimis limits for food subsidies to accommodate their larger food stockholding programs.  These programs are crucial for ensuring food security and protecting vulnerable populations.  Higher de minimis limits would allow these countries to continue their crucial food security initiatives without facing trade penalties under WTO rules.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Most developed countries do *not* support the unrestricted use of PSH by developing countries.  They often argue that PSH can distort markets and create unfair competition.  The disagreement highlights the tension between the need for food security in developing countries and the principles of fair trade under the WTO framework.  The "peace clause" is a temporary measure, and finding a permanent solution remains a significant challenge.


**16. With reference to India's initiatives to promote Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) globally, consider the following statements:**

1. The One Future Alliance, proposed by the G20 India Presidency, aims to provide financial and technical support to high-income countries for implementing DPI.
2. The Global DPI Repository (GDPIR) aims to establish a centralized institution to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices related to DPI development and implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While UPI was launched in 2016 and facilitates instant real-time payments, it was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), not directly by the RBI. The RBI plays a regulatory role, but NPCI is the implementing body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NPCI is *not* a private entity. It was incorporated in 2008 by the RBI and the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.

1.  India's first additional Tier I (AT-1) perpetual bond was issued before recent rule changes designed to enhance their appeal.
2.  Perpetual bonds are characterized by a fixed maturity date, offering buyers a coupon or interest payment at that date.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The issuance of India's first AT-1 perpetual bond *followed* recent regulatory changes aimed at making them more attractive investment options. These changes were crucial in paving the way for the successful introduction of this type of bond into the Indian market.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The defining characteristic of perpetual bonds is the *absence* of a maturity date. Unlike conventional bonds, they offer continuous interest payments without a predetermined repayment date for the principal.  The principal can be recovered through secondary market sales or issuer redemption, but this is not a guaranteed or fixed feature.


**4. With reference to Participatory Notes (P-Notes), consider the following statements:**

1.  P-Notes are issued by unregistered foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to overseas investors wishing to invest in the Indian stock market without direct registration.
2.  A benefit of using P-Notes is that they avoid the complexities of registering with SEBI and offer a degree of anonymity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. P-Notes are issued by *registered* foreign FPIs, not unregistered ones. This registration is a crucial aspect of their regulatory framework, ensuring some level of oversight and compliance with Indian regulations.  The issuing FPI is still subject to regulatory scrutiny.

Statement 2 is correct. One of the key advantages of P-Notes is the avoidance of direct registration with SEBI for overseas investors. This simplifies the investment process and also offers a degree of anonymity compared to direct investment, although not complete anonymity given the regulatory requirements on the issuing FPI.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Credit-Deposit (CD) Ratio:**

1.  A high CD ratio signifies that a bank is lending out a small portion of its mobilized deposits, potentially hindering economic growth.
2.  According to the RBI's Financial Stability Report, the CD ratio peaked at 78.8% in December 2023, with a majority of banks exceeding 75% being public sector banks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A high CD ratio indicates that a bank is lending out a *significant* portion of its mobilized deposits. While this carries risks, it can also *stimulate* economic growth by making more funds available for investment and lending.  The statement misrepresents the implication of a high CD ratio.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RBI report indicated that *over 75%* of banks with CD ratios above 75% were *private sector* banks, not public sector banks. This highlights a key difference in lending practices and risk profiles between the two sectors.


**6. With reference to India's efforts towards oilseed self-sufficiency, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Food Security Mission - Oilseeds & Oil Palm (NFSM-OS&OP) launched in 2018-19, primarily focuses on increasing the production inputs and technology transfer, but not on seed components.
2.  The Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) ensures that oilseed farmers receive Minimum Support Price (MSP) through a price support scheme but not through a price deficiency payment scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MPI is not solely based on economic indicators.  It's a multidimensional measure encompassing deprivations across education, health, and living standards.  While economic factors influence these aspects, the MPI directly assesses multiple dimensions of poverty, not just income or wealth.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the MPI's scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NMPI, indeed, uses NFHS data. Moreover, it expands upon the global MPI by adding indicators like maternal health and access to bank accounts. This demonstrates India's tailored approach to poverty measurement, incorporating context-specific factors influencing multidimensional poverty. The inclusion of these additional indicators highlights a move beyond the original global MPI framework.
