**2. Consider the following statements regarding the differences between carbon trading under the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement:**

1.  The Kyoto Protocol's carbon trading mechanism primarily focused on project-based mechanisms, whereas the Paris Agreement incorporates both market-based and non-market-based approaches.
2.  The Paris Agreement allows for the unrestricted use of legacy credits from pre-2013 projects, unlike the Kyoto Protocol which had stricter limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kyoto Protocol relied heavily on project-based mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI). These mechanisms focused on specific projects in developing and developed countries, respectively, that reduced emissions.  The Paris Agreement, however, adopts a broader approach, encompassing both market-based mechanisms (like international emissions trading) and non-market-based approaches (such as nationally determined contributions and policy measures).  This more flexible framework aims to foster greater participation and a more comprehensive response to climate change.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Paris Agreement places restrictions on the use of legacy credits (credits generated under the Kyoto Protocol's mechanisms before 2013).  There are concerns about the oversupply of these older credits and their potential to undermine the integrity of the new carbon market.  The Paris Agreement's Article 6 seeks to establish a robust and transparent system for carbon trading, minimizing the risk of double-counting and ensuring environmental integrity.  Therefore, the statement misrepresents the Paris Agreement's approach to legacy credits.

1.  The NCQG aims to replace the unmet $100 billion annual target set in 2009, extending beyond 2025.
2.  The NCQG is a legally binding commitment under the Paris Agreement, obligating developed countries to provide specific financial support to developing nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCQG was proposed at COP21 to establish a new climate finance goal post-2025, acknowledging the failure to meet the $100 billion annual target set in 2009. This new goal aims to build upon the previous commitment and address the continuing financial needs of developing countries in tackling climate change.  The process of setting the NCQG involves negotiations and discussions among participating countries to determine an appropriate and achievable target.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 9 of the Paris Agreement mandates developed countries to provide financial support to developing nations, the NCQG itself is not a legally binding commitment with specific amounts stipulated.  The amount and the modalities of financial support are subject to ongoing negotiations and agreements among the participating countries.  The lack of a legally binding figure for the NCQG reflects the complexities of international climate finance and the need for consensus-building among diverse nations.


**4.  With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

2.  States achieving a score of 100 on the SDG India Index have fully achieved the targets set for 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SDG India Index, while comprehensive, doesn't cover *all* 17 SDGs in their entirety.  It focuses on a subset of indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework.  The selection of indicators reflects the data availability and relevance to the Indian context.  While striving for comprehensiveness, the index acknowledges practical limitations in data collection and analysis.

Statement 2 is correct. A score of 100 on the SDG India Index signifies that a state or union territory has achieved the targets set for 2030 for the indicators included in the index.  This represents a significant milestone in achieving the SDGs but it is important to note that this score reflects progress on a specific set of indicators and not necessarily a complete fulfillment of all aspects of the relevant SDGs.  The index provides a valuable tool for monitoring progress but doesn't replace more nuanced assessments of SDG achievement.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):**

1.  The CBAM is a European Union policy that imposes a carbon tax on imports of all products from countries with less stringent climate policies.
2.  The primary objective of the CBAM is to prevent 'carbon leakage', where companies relocate production to countries with less stringent environmental regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBAM does not apply to *all* imported products.  It targets specific carbon-intensive products, initially focusing on a limited set of goods such as steel, cement, and fertilizers.  The EU's approach is phased, expanding the scope of covered products over time as data collection and monitoring systems improve.  This targeted approach reflects the need for a practical and manageable implementation strategy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CBAM's core objective is to prevent carbon leakage. This phenomenon occurs when companies shift their production to countries with less stringent environmental regulations to avoid higher carbon costs in their home countries.  By imposing a carbon tax on imports, the CBAM aims to level the playing field and incentivize companies to reduce their emissions throughout their supply chains, regardless of their location. This mechanism supports the EU's climate goals while also addressing concerns about competitiveness and fairness in international trade.


**7. With reference to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), consider the following statements:**

**4. With reference to the impact of cyclones in Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have led to a decrease in the frequency of cyclones in Southeast Asia.
2.  Cyclones in the Arabian Sea are now significantly less frequent than those in the Bay of Bengal, maintaining a ratio of approximately 1:4.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are not associated with a decrease in cyclone frequency in Southeast Asia. Instead, they are linked to an increase in the intensity, rapid intensification, and longer duration of these storms over land.  The higher SSTs provide more energy for cyclone development and intensification, making them more powerful and destructive. The statement contradicts established scientific understanding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While it's true that more cyclones historically occur in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea (approximately 4:1 ratio), the statement incorrectly claims this ratio is *maintained*.  Recent trends show an increase in cyclone frequency on the western coast (Arabian Sea), challenging the traditional 4:1 ratio.  Several factors, including unusual monsoon wind systems and warming of the Indian Ocean, are contributing to this shift.  The statement fails to reflect the changing dynamics of cyclone formation in the Indian Ocean region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While wind speed is the primary factor used to categorize tropical cyclones on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it's not the *sole* factor. The scale indirectly reflects other destructive potential through wind speed correlation with storm surge and rainfall.  Higher wind speeds typically correlate with higher storm surges and more intense rainfall, leading to greater damage.  The statement oversimplifies the factors considered in the scale's categorization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines a Category 5 hurricane (or super typhoon in the Pacific) as having sustained wind speeds of 252 km/hr or higher. This category represents the most intense and destructive type of tropical cyclone, capable of causing catastrophic damage. The statement accurately reflects the wind speed threshold for Category 5 storms.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Crocodile Conservation Project began in Bhitarkanika National Park, Odisha in 1975 with assistance from the UNDP and FAO, its focus was not solely on saltwater crocodiles.  The project aimed to conserve various crocodile species across India. The initial focus might have been on Bhitarkanika due to its significant saltwater crocodile population, but the project's scope expanded beyond a single location and species over time.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the UNDP and FAO did provide crucial assistance in the initial stages of the Crocodile Conservation Project,  it is inaccurate to state they provided continuous financial support throughout the project's 50-year history. The funding sources and levels likely changed and evolved over the years, involving various national and international organizations and governmental bodies. The continuous involvement of UNDP and FAO is not explicitly stated in the provided information.


**2. With reference to Ramsar sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries in Bihar are natural wetlands, recognized for their unique Deccan Plateau-like landscape within the Gangetic Plains.
2. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu is a freshwater lake situated along the Coromandel Coast, playing a crucial role in the Central Asian Flyway for migratory birds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries are *man-made* reservoirs (Nagi dam and Nakti dam), not natural wetlands. While they feature a landscape reminiscent of the Deccan Plateau, this is a characteristic of their surrounding area, not an inherent feature of the wetlands themselves.  The description emphasizes the artificial nature of these sanctuaries, contradicting the statement's claim of natural wetlands.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary is indeed located on the Coromandel Coast and falls within the Central Asian Flyway. However, it is a *brackish* shallow lake, not a freshwater lake. This crucial detail regarding the water's salinity makes the statement inaccurate. The presence of brackish water is a key characteristic of the sanctuary's ecosystem, highlighting the importance of precise terminology in ecological descriptions.


**3. With reference to the IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems, consider the following statements:**

1. The assessment covered mangrove ecosystems in 44 countries, classifying over 75% as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.
2. The mangrove ecosystems of South India were identified as vulnerable, while those in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Bay of Bengal were classified as least concern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List assessment covered 36 regions across 44 countries, but the percentage of ecosystems classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered was approximately 50%, not over 75%. This significant difference in the reported percentage highlights the importance of accurate data representation in environmental reports.  A misrepresentation of this scale can significantly alter the understanding of the severity of the threat.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The assessment indicated that the mangrove ecosystems of South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and the Northwest Atlantic were classified as *critically endangered*.  The statement incorrectly assigns a vulnerable status to South India and contradicts the provided information regarding the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Bay of Bengal, which were identified as Least Concern.  This incorrect categorization of the endangerment level demonstrates a failure to accurately recall the assessment's findings.


**4.  With reference to Fungi and its conservation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fungi Foundation, in collaboration with the UN Biodiversity program, advocates for the inclusion of "Funga" alongside "flora" and "fauna" to represent the full spectrum of life on Earth, highlighting fungi's crucial role in ecosystems.
2. Fungi encompass only multicellular organisms, exhibiting a remarkable diversity across various ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to arctic regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fungi Foundation, through its collaboration with the UN Biodiversity program, indeed promotes the use of the term "Funga" to emphasize the importance of fungal diversity in ecological classifications.  This initiative aims to raise awareness about fungi's often-overlooked role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health.  The statement accurately reflects the aims and actions of the Fungi Foundation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fungi are not exclusively multicellular organisms.  They exhibit a vast range of forms, including both single-celled (unicellular) and multicellular organisms.  This diverse range of structures and life cycles underlines the complexity of the fungal kingdom and its adaptation to various environments. The statement's assertion of exclusive multicellularity is a significant inaccuracy that demonstrates a lack of understanding of fundamental mycology.


**5. With reference to the  International Year of Camelids, consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations declared 2024 as the International Year of Camelids to promote the sustainable use of camelids for economic development, primarily focusing on their role as draught animals.
2.  The Kharai camel, found in the Kutch region of Gujarat, is known for its ability to swim long distances in the sea to graze on mangrove vegetation, highlighting its unique adaptation to coastal environments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN did declare 2024 as the International Year of Camelids, aiming to raise awareness of the untapped potential of camelids and promote their sustainable use. While their role as draught animals is a significant aspect, the initiative also encompasses other uses and benefits associated with these animals, including their economic and cultural significance.  The statement accurately reflects a major objective of the declaration.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kharai camel, unique to the Kutch region, possesses the remarkable ability to swim in the sea to access mangrove vegetation for grazing. This unique adaptation is a testament to its resilience and its specialized ecological niche. The statement correctly highlights this specific characteristic of the Kharai camel, showcasing its distinct ecological role.


**6. With reference to the  UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlights that only a small fraction of the top twenty countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have included quantified forest-related targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The UN-REDD Programme primarily focuses on afforestation and reforestation initiatives to mitigate climate change, advocating for a reduction in deforestation as a secondary objective.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN-REDD Programme's report indeed indicates that a limited number of countries among the top twenty with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have included quantified forest-related targets in their NDCs. This finding underscores the significant gap between stated commitments and concrete actions to combat deforestation. The statement accurately reflects a key finding of the report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UN-REDD Programme acknowledges the importance of afforestation and reforestation, its primary focus is on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).  Reducing deforestation is considered a crucial first step in mitigating climate change, not a secondary objective. The statement misrepresents the core mandate and priorities of the UN-REDD Programme.  It prioritizes the direct reduction of deforestation as the primary method to decrease emissions.


**7. With reference to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, consider the following statements:**

1. The La Gomera giant lizard ( *Gallotia bravoana*) was reclassified from Endangered to Critically Endangered in the recent update, reflecting a worsening of its conservation status.
2.  The Bornean elephant was upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered status, indicating a significant decline in its population and increased risk of extinction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The La Gomera giant lizard (*Gallotia bravoana*) was actually reclassified from *Critically Endangered* to *Endangered*, representing an improvement in its conservation status, not a worsening.  The statement incorrectly reverses the change in classification, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the IUCN Red List update.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bornean elephant was indeed upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered, reflecting a concerning decline in its population and an increased risk of extinction. This change highlights the severity of the threats faced by this specific elephant population and the urgency for conservation efforts. The statement correctly reflects this change in classification, underscoring the seriousness of the situation.


**8. With reference to the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC), consider the following statements:**

1. The SFTLC, hosted by the Bhutanese government and supported by the Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC), aims to mobilize US$1 billion in additional funding for tiger conservation by 2030.
2. The TCC is a governmental organization composed of representatives from tiger range countries, focused on coordinating national conservation strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The SFTLC, hosted by Bhutan and supported by the TCC, aims to mobilize a significant amount of additional funding for tiger conservation.  While the exact target year might differ slightly (the provided text states 2034, not 2030), the core aim of securing substantial financial resources for tiger protection remains accurate. The minor discrepancy in the target year doesn't invalidate the fundamental accuracy of the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The TCC is an *independent* group of organizations, not a governmental organization. It brings together various stakeholders, including biologists, experts, and organizations, to work collaboratively on tiger conservation. The statement's characterization of the TCC as a governmental body is inaccurate, misrepresenting its organizational structure and operational nature.


**9. With reference to the Elephant Census 2023 in Southern India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The census revealed that Karnataka has the largest elephant population among the Southern states, exceeding 7,000 elephants.
2. A high death rate among juvenile elephants (aged 10 and below) was primarily attributed to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Karnataka did top the Southern states in the elephant population count, the number was *over 6,000*, not exceeding 7,000. The statement's exaggeration of the population number misrepresents the census's findings.  Precise numerical data is crucial in population assessments, and the discrepancy highlights the importance of accurate reporting.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The high death rate among juvenile elephants was primarily attributed to *Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesviruses (EEHVs)*, not habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.  While these factors contribute to elephant mortality, the census specifically pointed to EEHVs as the leading cause of death among young elephants.  The statement fails to accurately identify the primary cause of mortality, demonstrating a misinterpretation of the census's key findings.


**10. With reference to the State of the Rhino 2024 Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report, released by the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), indicates that the global rhino population has increased by over 5,000 in the past year.
2.  The report highlights a significant increase in rhino poaching in Africa, exceeding a 10% increase from 2022 to 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report states that there are *just under 28,000 rhinos left in the world*, not an increase of over 5,000. This statement fundamentally misrepresents the report's findings by suggesting a positive trend where there was not one. The statement fails to acknowledge the overall precarious conservation status of rhino populations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The report indicates a 4% increase in rhino poaching in Africa from 2022 to 2023, not exceeding 10%.  This misrepresentation of the percentage increase distorts the severity of the poaching problem. While a 4% increase is still a significant concern, the statement's exaggeration of the figure misleads the reader and minimizes the accuracy of the data.


**1. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB is a statutory body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
2.  The CPCB's primary function is to monitor and regulate air and water pollution, and it has no direct role in managing environmental compensation funds.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body, but it was formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it was later entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection, but the CPCB's foundational legislation predates it.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, empowers the Central Government to establish various bodies for environmental protection, but it doesn't specifically establish the CPCB.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While the CPCB's core function is monitoring and regulating air and water pollution, in practice, it receives and manages environmental compensation funds.  These funds are often collected as penalties or charges for environmental violations. Therefore, the statement is misleading by implying a complete lack of involvement in managing such funds. The CPCB plays a crucial role in the implementation of environmental legislation, including the mechanisms for collecting and utilizing environmental compensation.  Its involvement in the management of these funds is indirectly related to its core function of pollution control and enforcement.


**2. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT receives environmental compensation funds directly from polluters and distributes them to affected parties.
2. The NGT's orders are binding on both the Central and State Governments, and they can issue directions related to environmental protection.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGT doesn't directly receive and distribute environmental compensation funds. While the NGT can order the payment of compensation for environmental damage, the actual collection and disbursement of funds are typically handled by other agencies or authorities, such as the CPCB or designated State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).  The NGT's role is primarily judicial—it adjudicates cases and issues orders related to environmental issues, including compensation.  It doesn't function as a financial institution.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT is a specialized environmental tribunal with the power to issue binding orders on both the Central and State Governments. Its orders are enforceable under the law, and it can direct various actions related to environmental protection, prevention of pollution, and compensation for environmental damage.  The NGT's authority is derived from the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, which grants it wide-ranging powers to address environmental concerns.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

1. The index measures progress on all 17 SDGs and ranks states based on their overall performance.
2. A score of 100 indicates that a state/UT has fully achieved all the SDG targets for 2030.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SDG India Index 2023-24 doesn't cover all 17 SDGs comprehensively. It focuses on a subset of indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework, comprising 113 indicators.  While the index aims to reflect progress towards the SDGs, it doesn't provide a complete picture of achievement across all 17 goals.

Statement 2 is correct.  A score of 100 on the SDG India Index indeed signifies that a particular state or Union Territory has met all the targets set for 2030, as defined by the chosen indicators within the index framework.  It’s important to note that this doesn’t necessarily mean complete achievement of all aspects of the respective SDGs, as the index uses a limited set of indicators.  The score represents progress based on the specific indicators included in the index.


**4. With reference to the Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Atlas shows a consistent decline in agricultural land over the past 17 years.
2. The Atlas indicates a significant increase in built-up land area since 2005, reflecting urbanization trends.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Atlas shows an expansion of Kharif and Rabi cropland, not a decline, over the past 17 years, along with a decrease in fallow land.  Double/triple cropping areas have also increased.  Therefore, the statement presents the opposite of what the Atlas indicates.

Statement 2 is correct. The Atlas clearly indicates a substantial increase in built-up land area since 2005, reflecting the growth of urban areas and associated infrastructure development. This increase is a significant finding of the Atlas, highlighting the spatial dynamics of urbanization in India.  The data on built-up land growth is a key element of the Atlas's analysis of land use changes.


**5. With reference to the  European Union’s Nature Restoration Plan (NRP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NRP aims to restore at least 30% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030.
2. The NRP focuses solely on restoring forests and wetlands, neglecting other ecosystems.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRP aims to recover at least 20%, not 30%, of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030, with a goal of restoring all ecosystems in need by 2050.  The statement overstates the target percentage set by the NRP.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRP has a broader scope than just forests and wetlands. While these are important focus areas, it also includes other ecosystems and considers various aspects of biodiversity restoration, such as pollinating insects and grasslands.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the plan, presenting a partial and inaccurate view of its objectives.  The NRP's comprehensive approach to nature restoration is a key feature of the legislation.


**6. With reference to the  UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme focuses solely on reducing emissions from deforestation in developed countries.
2. A recent UN-REDD report highlighted that a significant number of countries with high deforestation rates lack quantified targets for forest conservation in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UN-REDD Programme focuses on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in developing countries.  The program specifically targets countries that have significant forest cover and are experiencing high rates of deforestation.  The statement incorrectly restricts the program's geographical scope.

Statement 2 is correct. A UN-REDD report did indeed highlight that many countries with high rates of tropical deforestation lack specific, quantified targets related to forests in their NDCs. This finding underscores the need for greater ambition and action to protect forests and mitigate climate change.  The report's key finding on the lack of quantified targets in NDCs is a significant aspect of the publication.


**7.  With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA is a framework developed solely by the World Bank to measure the economic value of natural resources.
2. The SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) focuses on measuring the services provided by individual natural resources, such as timber or water, rather than entire ecosystems.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEA is an internationally agreed framework, not solely a World Bank initiative, for compiling environmental-economic accounts.  Many international organizations, including the UN, have contributed to its development and implementation.  The statement misrepresents the origins and collaborative nature of the SEEA.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SEEA-EA specifically focuses on measuring the services provided by entire ecosystems, such as forests, rivers, or coral reefs, not just individual resources.  SEEA-CF, on the other hand, deals with individual resources. The statement reverses the roles of SEEA-EA and SEEA-CF. The distinction between ecosystem-level accounting and resource-level accounting is a core element of the SEEA framework.


**8. With reference to the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GEPI is a globally standardized index used by all Indian states to measure environmental performance.
2. The GEPI calculation includes assessment of air, soil, water, and forest resources.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GEPI is not a globally standardized index and is currently not used by all Indian states.  Uttarakhand was the first state to adopt it, but its adoption by other states is not yet widespread.  The statement misrepresents the index's current status and adoption.

Statement 2 is correct. The GEPI calculation does indeed include an assessment of air, soil, water, and forest resources as its four pillars.  These four elements form the basis of the index's comprehensive approach to evaluating environmental conditions. The components of the GEPI calculation are central to its methodology.


**1. With reference to the Forest Fire Reduction Initiative (FERI), consider the following statements:**

1. FERI is implemented by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat and assists developing countries in achieving Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 14, and 15.
2.  The WePlan – Forests Platform, a decision support tool for tropical forest ecosystem restoration, is one of FERI's key initiatives, and it primarily focuses on reforestation efforts in boreal forests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  FERI, a partnership between the Korea Forest Service (KFS) and the CBD Secretariat, is indeed implemented by the CBD Secretariat. Its primary goal is to aid developing nations in meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (specifically 5, 14, and 15) and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) by operationalizing national targets and plans related to ecosystem restoration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While WePlan – Forests Platform is a FERI initiative designed as a decision support tool for tropical forest ecosystem restoration, the statement incorrectly asserts its primary focus is on boreal forests.  The text explicitly mentions its application to tropical forest ecosystems.  The focus on boreal forests is a deliberate misdirection, a common technique used in UPSC-style questions to test the candidate's precise understanding of the subject matter.


**2. With reference to the EU’s Nature Restoration Plan (NRP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NRP aims to restore at least 30% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050, and it is a legally binding instrument under the European Green Deal.
2. The NRP's implementation relies solely on the European Commission's direct intervention, bypassing national-level involvement in restoration efforts across the EU member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The NRP, a key component of the EU's European Green Deal, does aim for the restoration of at least 20% (not 30%) of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030, with a broader goal of restoring all ecosystems needing it by 2050.  It is indeed a legally binding, continent-wide law. The slight numerical discrepancy serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NRP's implementation relies significantly on National Restoration Plans developed and executed by individual EU countries. The European Commission plays a coordinating and oversight role, but the implementation is not solely dependent on its direct intervention. This highlights the difference between policy formulation at the EU level and its practical application at the national level, a crucial aspect of understanding EU governance.


**3. With reference to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The EUDR applies to a wide range of products, including palm oil, soy, beef, cocoa, timber, and rubber, and mandates companies to verify the product's origin through independent third-party audits only.
2. The proposed one-year extension of the EUDR implementation aims to allow for further refinement of the regulation's scope and enforcement mechanisms while mitigating potential negative impacts on EU businesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in listing the products covered by the EUDR but incorrect in specifying *only* independent third-party audits for verification. While independent audits are a key part of verification, the regulation allows for other methods as well depending on the product and supply chain. This detail is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the EUDR's practical implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The proposed one-year extension reflects the EU's pragmatic approach to policy implementation.  It aims to address potential challenges and refine the regulation before full-scale enforcement, balancing environmental goals with the economic realities faced by EU businesses.  This showcases the complexities of international trade regulations and the need for a nuanced understanding of their implementation.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding soil acidification management:**

1. Liming, which involves incorporating lime, gypsum, or dolomite into the upper soil layer, is a widely used method for managing acid soils, and it primarily works by increasing the soil's pH level.
2. Growing acid-tolerant crops like sugarcane and bananas is a completely ineffective method for managing acid soils and offers no significant improvement in soil health or crop yield.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Liming is a standard practice for managing soil acidification.  The addition of lime, gypsum, or dolomite raises the soil's pH, neutralizing the acidity. This directly addresses one of the primary negative impacts of acidification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While sugarcane and bananas are known for their tolerance to acidic conditions, growing them is not a completely ineffective method.  It’s a strategy to mitigate the effects of acidification, allowing for crop production in otherwise unsuitable conditions.  It's not a complete solution but a valuable adaptation strategy.  The statement uses strong, incorrect language ("completely ineffective") to create a distractor.


**5. With reference to Biocover technology, consider the following statements:**

1. Biocovers are porous material layers laid directly on top of landfills, covered by an oxidizing layer of mature compost, and primarily designed to control fugitive methane emissions by converting methane into carbon dioxide.
2.  Biocover technology is only applicable to the management of newly established landfills and is unsuitable for older landfill sites due to the complexity of established microbial communities within the waste material.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Biocover technology.  The porous layers create an environment conducive to methanotrophic bacteria, which then convert methane into carbon dioxide, thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.  The use of mature compost enhances the oxidizing layer, optimizing the process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the application of Biocover to "old dumpsites" for controlling fugitive methane emissions.  The statement falsely restricts its applicability to only new landfills, misrepresenting the technology's scope and capabilities. This incorrect limitation serves as a significant distractor.


**6. With reference to the "grasshopper effect," consider the following statements:**

1. The "grasshopper effect" is a process where plastic and toxic chemicals, transported via atmospheric and oceanic currents, accumulate in the Arctic region, making it a "hemispheric sink."
2.  The "grasshopper effect" is primarily driven by the seasonal migration patterns of insects, which carry and deposit these pollutants across vast geographical distances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly defines the "grasshopper effect" as a process of global distillation where pollutants, including plastics and toxic chemicals, are transported long distances via atmospheric and oceanic currents and accumulate in polar regions like the Arctic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While insect migration can contribute to the dispersal of some pollutants, the primary mechanism of the grasshopper effect is atmospheric and oceanic circulation, not insect migration.  The incorrect association with insect migration creates a plausible but false connection, testing the candidate's precise understanding.


**7.  With reference to Superhydrophobic Catalysts, consider the following statements:**

1. Superhydrophobic catalysts are derived from biomass (cellulose), are eco-friendly, reusable, and affordable, and their primary application is in the production of biofuels.
2.  The superhydrophobic nature of these catalysts allows them to withstand water by-products during biodiesel production, preventing the deactivation of active sites by water.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Superhydrophobic catalysts, derived from biomass (cellulose), possess several desirable characteristics:  they are eco-friendly, abundant, reusable, and affordable.  Their key application is in biofuel production, where their superhydrophobic nature is advantageous.

Statement 2 correctly points out that this superhydrophobic property is crucial in preventing water from deactivating the catalyst's active sites during biodiesel production, enhancing efficiency and longevity.  There are no misleading elements in this question; both statements accurately reflect the characteristics and applications of these catalysts.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of EPR was introduced in the E-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011, not in the 2022 rules. The 2022 rules further strengthened and refined the EPR framework.  The introduction of EPR was a landmark development in e-waste management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The E-waste (Management) Amendment Rules, 2024, do not mandate a complete ban on the import of e-waste.  The rules focus on improving the management of e-waste within the country, but they don't impose a complete import ban. Therefore, both statements are incorrect.



**1. With reference to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NDRF R&R window primarily focuses on providing immediate relief during a disaster, while long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts are handled separately through other funding mechanisms.
2.  Funds allocated under NDRF and SDRF are exclusively used for response and relief efforts, with preparedness and capacity building initiatives funded through different sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  The NDRF and SDRF funding is not limited to immediate relief. The R&R (Recovery and Reconstruction) window, established within the NDRF and SDRF frameworks, specifically addresses long-term recovery and reconstruction needs. This window aims to bridge funding gaps for states affected by disasters, exceeding their coping capacity.  Furthermore, the funds are distributed across three key areas: response and relief, recovery and reconstruction, and preparedness and capacity building.  The allocation isn't segregated into entirely separate funding streams for these different phases of disaster management. The 15th Finance Commission recommendations directly influenced the creation of the R&R window to improve the funding for post-disaster recovery efforts.


**2. With reference to the FloodWatch India mobile application, consider the following statements:**

1.  FloodWatch India version 2.0 monitors over 700 flood monitoring stations and major reservoirs across India, providing real-time flood situation updates.
2.  The application utilizes solely satellite data analysis for flood forecasting, providing highly accurate predictions up to 14 days in advance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. FloodWatch India 2.0 significantly expanded its coverage from 200 to 592 flood monitoring stations, along with 150 major reservoirs.  It provides real-time information and flood forecasts up to 7 days, but not 14 days.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While satellite data is a crucial component, FloodWatch India uses a multi-faceted approach combining satellite data analysis with mathematical modeling and real-time monitoring from various sources to generate its flood forecasts.  The accuracy and forecast period are not solely dependent on satellite data; other factors and limitations affect prediction accuracy and timeframe.


**3. With reference to the 'Early Warnings for All (EW4All)' initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  EW4All aims to provide early warning systems (EWS) for all types of natural disasters by the end of 2025, ensuring universal protection.
2.  The initiative is solely funded by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the timeline. EW4All aims to achieve its goal by the end of 2027, not 2025.  The initiative focuses on hazardous weather, water, or climate events, but not all types of natural disasters (e.g., geological events).  Statement 2 is incorrect concerning funding. While the WMO and UNDRR spearhead the initiative, EW4All requires significant global investment.  The initiative calls for USD 3.1 billion in investments between 2023 and 2027 to strengthen its four pillars: disaster risk knowledge, detection and monitoring, warning dissemination, and preparedness and response.  Funding sources extend beyond the WMO and UNDRR.


**4. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB's primary function is to enforce environmental regulations and impose penalties for violations,  working independently of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
2. The CPCB is solely responsible for the implementation of environmental legislations across India, without any involvement from State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body, but it functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change.  While the CPCB plays a crucial role in implementing environmental legislations, it doesn't operate in isolation. It collaborates closely with the SPCBs to ensure effective implementation across the country.  The CPCB's functions extend beyond enforcement and penalties to include promoting environmental cleanliness and improving air and water quality.  It also plays a key role in receiving and managing funds related to environmental protection and compensation.


**5. With reference to the Recovery and Reconstruction (R&R) Funding Window, consider the following statements:**

1. The R&R window was established to replace existing disaster relief frameworks, providing a more streamlined approach to funding disaster recovery.
2.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended the creation of the R&R window to address funding gaps in disaster recovery, particularly in states with limited financial resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The R&R window was not created to replace existing disaster relief frameworks but to *supplement* them.  It works within the existing NDRF and SDRF structures to improve the allocation of resources for recovery efforts.  Statement 2 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission explicitly recommended the creation of the R&R window to help states better manage the financial burden of post-disaster recovery.  The aim was to address the funding gaps and ensure sufficient resources are available for reconstruction and rehabilitation.


**6.  With reference to Parametric Insurance, consider the following statements:**

1. Parametric insurance compensates for the actual losses incurred due to a covered event, providing a precise financial reimbursement.
2. Parametric insurance policies primarily cover events with easily measurable parameters, such as earthquake magnitude or wind speed, but not events with less quantifiable impacts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Parametric insurance doesn't compensate for actual losses but for the *probability* or likelihood of a loss-causing event occurring, based on pre-defined parameters. The payout is triggered when a pre-defined threshold is met, regardless of the actual financial loss incurred. Statement 2 is largely correct. Parametric insurance is best suited for events with clearly measurable parameters (e.g., earthquake magnitude, wind speed, flood water depth).  Events with less quantifiable consequences are more challenging to insure parametrically because establishing clear triggers and payout structures becomes difficult.


**7. With reference to the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  GEPI is a comprehensive index that evaluates the overall environmental health of a region, including factors like air and water quality, biodiversity, and waste management.
2.  Uttarakhand was the first Indian state to implement GEPI, using a formula that incorporates four key environmental pillars: air, soil, trees, and water.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While GEPI does consider the environmental impact of human activities, it's not a comprehensive measure of overall environmental health. It primarily focuses on quantifying the contribution of natural ecosystems to the economy and overall welfare, using a specific formula based on four pillars.  Statement 2 is correct. Uttarakhand indeed became the first Indian state to launch a GEPI, using a formula that combines indices for air, soil, trees (forests), and water to assess ecological development due to human intervention.  The formula helps quantify the impact of human pressure on the environment and the ecosystem's contribution to the economy.


**8. With reference to the  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDG India Index measures the progress of all states and union territories (UTs) on 17 goals, using over 200 indicators aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
2.  A score of 100 on the SDG India Index indicates that a state or UT has fully achieved all the targets set for 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the number of indicators and goals.  The SDG India Index uses 113 indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework, not 17 goals and 200 indicators.  The index tracks progress across various indicators related to the UN's SDGs but doesn't directly measure progress on each of the 17 individual goals separately.  Statement 2 is correct. A score of 100 signifies that a state or UT has fully achieved the targets set for 2030 according to the index's methodology.


**9. With reference to the  People's Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PBR is a voluntary initiative by local communities to document their traditional knowledge related to biodiversity, without any legal backing or recognition.
2. The information documented in the PBR includes the availability and uses of local biological resources, as well as traditional knowledge associated with them,  primarily to support sustainable resource management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PBR has statutory recognition under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.  Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) are mandated to prepare PBRs in consultation with local people.  It is not merely voluntary.  Statement 2 is correct. The PBR aims to document and safeguard bioresources and associated traditional knowledge. The information compiled includes the availability, uses (medicinal or otherwise), and traditional knowledge related to local biological resources.  This documentation is crucial for supporting claims of local ownership and promoting sustainable resource management.  


**10. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Areas (ESAs), consider the following statements:**

1. ESAs are designated by state governments based on their assessment of the ecological sensitivity of an area, and they have the authority to enforce regulations within these zones.
2. The primary purpose of declaring an area as an ESA is to restrict all human activities to protect the environment and prevent degradation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ESAs are notified by the *central* government under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, not state governments. While states play a role in implementation, the designation and overarching regulations come from the central authority.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The purpose of ESAs is not to completely restrict all human activities.  The goal is to regulate activities to minimize environmental degradation while allowing for sustainable development and the well-being of local communities.  Regulations vary depending on the specific ESA and its ecological sensitivity.  Some activities may be completely prohibited, while others may be allowed with certain restrictions.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs):**

1.  The primary cause of GLOFs is the sudden and catastrophic failure of moraine dams due to seismic activity.
2.  The expansion of glacial lakes in the Himalayas is primarily attributed to increased precipitation and glacial melting due to climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While seismic activity can contribute to GLOFs by destabilizing moraine dams, it is not the primary cause.  GLOFs are complex events resulting from a combination of factors, including geological instability of moraine dams (which can be triggered by several factors including seismic activity, but also by water pressure, erosion, and other factors), morphological changes in the lake basin, increased precipitation, and glacial surging.  Moraine dam failure is a significant factor, but the statement oversimplifies the causality.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that glacial lakes in the Himalayas have expanded significantly (a 33.7% increase is mentioned), and this expansion is directly linked to increased glacial melting driven by climate change and increased precipitation.  This is a well-established scientific understanding.  The regions most affected, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, all experience the impacts of climate change on glacial melt.


**2. With reference to the Central Water Commission (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC is responsible for monitoring and managing both surface and groundwater resources in India.
2. The CWC's mandate includes promoting sustainable development and integrated management of India's water resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that the CWC deals *only* with surface water resources.  Groundwater management falls under the purview of the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB), a separate organization.  The statement conflates the responsibilities of two different agencies.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the CWC aims to promote integrated and sustainable development and management of India's water resources. This is a core function of the organization as described in the provided information.


**3. With reference to the impact of GLOFs, consider the following statements:**

1.  GLOFs primarily impact downstream river systems, causing sudden and significant increases in water discharge, but have minimal effect on human settlements.
2.  The 2023 GLOF at South Lhonak, Sikkim, resulted in the destruction of the Teesta III Dam, highlighting the devastating consequences of these events.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GLOFs do cause large downstream river discharges, the text implies that they significantly impact human settlements. The mention of GLOFs being recognized as potential climatological disasters in India's National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) 2019, and the examples provided (2013 Uttarakhand floods and the 2023 Sikkim dam destruction) demonstrate that GLOFs pose a serious threat to human life and infrastructure. The statement minimizes the human impact.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly cites the 2023 GLOF at South Lhonak, Sikkim, as leading to the destruction of the Teesta III Dam. This is presented as a real-world example of the destructive potential of GLOFs, directly contradicting the minimized impact described in statement 1.


**4. With reference to the management of GLOFs in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has not yet issued any guidelines specifically addressing GLOF risk mitigation.
2.  The review of dam designs vulnerable to GLOFs is solely the responsibility of the state-level disaster management authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that the NDMA *has* issued guidelines for GLOFs.  The statement incorrectly claims the absence of such guidelines.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the CWC is involved in reviewing the design flood of dams vulnerable to GLOFs.  This demonstrates that the responsibility for dam design review is not solely at the state level but involves a central agency as well. The statement incorrectly attributes sole responsibility to state authorities.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the characteristics of GLOFs:**

1. GLOF events are typically slow-onset disasters, developing gradually over several weeks before culminating in a flood.
2.  Glacial surging, a rapid and significant advance of a glacier, can contribute to the formation of GLOFs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes GLOFs as "sudden (and sometimes cyclic) releases of water" and "rapid events, lasting hours to days."  This directly contradicts the description of a slow-onset disaster in the statement.  GLOFs are characterized by their rapid and unexpected nature.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly lists "Glacial Surging" as a contributing factor to GLOF formation, providing the example of the Gilkey Glacier in Alaska.  The statement accurately reflects this causal relationship.


**6. With reference to the "Kallakkadal" phenomenon, consider the following statements:**

1. Kallakkadal is a type of coastal flooding caused by strong winds associated with monsoonal activity.
2. Swell waves, generated by distant weather systems, are a primary factor contributing to Kallakkadal events.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, although it is an oversimplification. While Kallakkadal is coastal flooding, the text specifies that it occurs in pre-monsoon or post-monsoon seasons, not exclusively during monsoonal activity. The statement, therefore, does not entirely misrepresent the phenomenon.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of Kallakkadal explicitly states that swell waves generated by distant storms are the cause of coastal flooding.  This statement accurately reflects the mechanism behind this phenomenon.


**7. With reference to the heat budget of the Earth, consider the following statements:**

1.  The melting of glaciers has no significant impact on the Earth's heat budget.
2.  Greenhouse gas emissions are a major factor contributing to disturbances in the Earth's heat budget.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly lists the melting of glaciers as a factor that *does* disturb the Earth's heat budget. The melting of ice changes albedo (reflectivity) and releases stored water, influencing the overall heat balance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly identifies greenhouse gas emissions as a key factor responsible for disturbing the heat budget. This is a well-established scientific principle.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the PREFIRE mission:**

1. PREFIRE is a NASA mission focused on measuring the amount of heat radiated from the Earth's surface.
2.  The PREFIRE mission aims to improve our understanding of polar climate dynamics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While PREFIRE does measure heat radiation, it specifically focuses on the heat radiated from the Arctic and Antarctic *into space*, not from the Earth's surface in general. The statement is too broad and doesn't accurately capture the mission's specific focus.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of PREFIRE explicitly states its goal is to measure how much heat the Arctic and Antarctica radiate into space. This directly contributes to understanding polar climate dynamics and how these regions interact with the global climate system.  The statement accurately reflects the mission's scientific objective.


**9. With reference to the CoS-it-FloWS system, consider the following statements:**

1. CoS-it-FloWS is a government-run initiative focused on improving national-level flood forecasting accuracy.
2.  CoS-it-FloWS utilizes community-sourced data to enhance hyper-local flood forecasting capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that CoS-it-FloWS is a project run by Equinoct, a private, Kochi-based company, not a government initiative.  While it aims to improve flood forecasting, it does so at a hyper-local level, not the national level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of CoS-it-FloWS explicitly highlights its reliance on community-sourced data (collected by students, women, and youth) to supplement government data and improve hyper-local flood forecasting accuracy.  The statement accurately describes the system's core functionality.


**10. With reference to the IMD's weather forecasting capabilities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMD currently has the ability to forecast weather events with high accuracy for areas as small as 1 km x 1 km.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the IMD currently forecasts weather for 12 km x 12 km areas.  The statement incorrectly claims much higher resolution forecasting is already achieved.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the IMD is *experimenting* with 3 km x 3 km grid forecasts and aiming for even smaller 1 km x 1 km grids in the future.  The statement accurately reflects the IMD's ongoing efforts to improve hyper-local forecasting.


**11. With reference to the DEWS (Drought Early Warning System) data, consider the following statements:**

1. DEWS data indicated that less than 20% of India's land area experienced drought conditions in September 2023.
2. August 2023 was the driest August in India since 1901, based on DEWS data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that 30% of India's land area experienced drought in September 2023 according to DEWS data. The statement significantly underestimates the extent of drought reported.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that August 2023 was the driest August since 1901, based on DEWS data. This statement directly reflects the information provided.


**12. Consider the following statements about the naming of undersea features:**

1.  The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) sets guidelines for naming undersea features only within a nation's territorial waters.
2.  Proposals for naming undersea features outside territorial waters are reviewed by the IHO Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the IHO's 2013 guidelines apply to both features within and outside territorial waters.  The statement incorrectly restricts the IHO's role to only territorial waters.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that proposals for naming undersea features outside territorial waters are reviewed by the IHO SCUFN. This accurately reflects the process described.


**13. With reference to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IHO is a non-governmental organization with observer status at the United Nations.
2. India is not a member of the IHO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text states that the IHO is an *intergovernmental* body (not non-governmental) with observer status at the UN.  While the word "intergovernmental" is different from "non-governmental", the statement accurately captures the key elements of the IHO's status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India *is* a member of the IHO.  The statement provides inaccurate information regarding India's membership.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the  "Aandhi" or "Kali Aandhi" winds:**

1.  These strong dust storms are primarily observed during the monsoon season in northwestern and central India.
2. These winds contribute to air pollution in cities like Delhi and can cause damage to life and property.

It was formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and later given powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  While it functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, its establishment isn't rooted in the Constitution.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection but doesn't establish the CPCB itself.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The CPCB, in collaboration with SPCBs, is indeed responsible for implementing legislation related to the prevention and control of air and water pollution. However, the statement's exclusion of noise pollution is misleading.  While the CPCB's primary focus is air and water, it also plays a role in addressing noise pollution through various guidelines and collaborations. The omission of this aspect makes the statement inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is partially correct, but its inaccuracy regarding noise pollution makes option (b) the most suitable answer.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the National Green Tribunal (NGT):**

1. The NGT receives environmental compensation funds only as per orders of the Supreme Court of India.
2. The NGT's primary function is to adjudicate environmental disputes, and it does not have the power to levy environmental charges directly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NGT does receive compensation funds related to environmental violations, it's not exclusively limited to orders from the Supreme Court.  The NGT receives such funds based on its own orders and also those from other courts and tribunals.  The source of the funds might be environmental protection charges, penalties imposed for violations, or other forms of environmental compensation.  Limiting the source to Supreme Court orders is an oversimplification and an inaccurate representation of the NGT's financial mechanisms.

Statement 2 is correct. The NGT's core function is to handle environmental disputes and provide speedy and expert environmental adjudication. While it can order compensation and other remedial measures, it doesn't have the authority to independently levy environmental charges.  The power to levy charges typically rests with other government bodies and agencies, and the NGT's role is to ensure environmental protection through adjudication and enforcement of relevant laws.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDG India Index measures progress on all 17 SDGs with a total of 300 indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework.
2.  A score of 100 in the SDG India Index indicates that a State/UT has fully achieved all the targets set for 2030 for all 17 SDGs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SDG India Index does not utilize 300 indicators. The index tracks progress across all 17 SDGs, but the total number of indicators used is 113, not 300, and these are aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework.  The number of indicators is significantly lower than 300.

Statement 2 is correct. A perfect score of 100 on the SDG India Index signifies that a State or Union Territory has completely achieved all the targets established for 2030 for all 17 SDGs.  This represents complete attainment of the goals within the index's framework.  The score provides a benchmark for assessing progress toward the 2030 targets.


**4. With reference to the National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF), consider the following statements:**

1. NMNF was launched as a standalone Centrally Sponsored Scheme in 2019 under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, and aims to cover 12 lakh hectares in 600 major blocks of the country.
2.  The NMNF provides financial assistance of ₹12,200 per hectare for 5 years to farmers for cluster formation and capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While NMNF is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, its launch date is not 2019; it was renamed from BPKP in 2023-24. Also, the aim is to cover 12 lakh hectares, but the number of blocks is not specified as 600.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The financial assistance provided by NMNF is ₹12,200 per hectare, but it is provided for 3 years, not 5 years.  The duration of financial assistance is a key element of the scheme's implementation.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Green Credit Programme (GCP):**

1. The GCP is aimed at incentivizing industries to voluntarily offset their carbon emissions through eligible activities like tree plantations and sustainable agriculture practices, and it is established under the "The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986".
2. The GCP's governance structure includes an inter-ministerial Steering Committee, with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) serving as the GCP Administrator.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GCP aligns with the 'LiFE' initiative and encourages industries and other entities to meet their carbon emission reduction obligations, either mandatory or voluntary, through activities such as tree plantations and sustainable agriculture. It is established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the GCP does have an inter-ministerial Steering Committee, the MoEFCC is the nodal agency, not the administrator. The Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) serves as the GCP Administrator for program implementation, management, monitoring, and operation.  The roles of the MoEFCC and ICFRE are distinct within the GCP's governance structure.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on environment-related topics.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to India's stance at COP29, consider the following statements:**

1. India proposed a goal of $1.3 trillion annually under the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG), with half of this amount coming from grants or equivalent resources.
2. India supported the use of third-party databases to measure progress on adaptation and endorsed the UAE dialogue text for its balanced approach to mitigation and finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. India did propose a $1.3 trillion annual goal under the NCQG, advocating for a significant portion ($600 billion) to come from grants or equivalent resources.  The text doesn't specify exactly half, but the emphasis on grants highlights a key aspect of India's position.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India explicitly *opposed* the use of third-party databases for measuring adaptation progress, citing concerns about data accuracy and sovereignty.  Furthermore, India criticized the UAE dialogue text for its perceived lack of connection to finance, imbalance, and mitigation-centric language.  These actions directly contradict the claims made in statement 2.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects India's position at COP29.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme:**

1.  IDWH is a state-sponsored scheme primarily focused on protecting wildlife within designated protected areas.
2. The Species Recovery Program under IDWH has, to date, identified and prioritized over 50 critically endangered species for focused conservation efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IDWH is a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not state-sponsored.  While it does support protected areas (national parks, sanctuaries, etc.), its scope extends beyond these areas to include wildlife protection outside protected areas and species recovery programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that 22 species have been identified under the Species Recovery Program, not over 50. This discrepancy makes the statement factually inaccurate.  Therefore, neither statement accurately describes the IDWH scheme.


**3. With reference to the Western Ghats Eco-sensitive Area, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kasturirangan Committee report recommended designating approximately 60,000 square kilometers of the Western Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA), with the largest portion in Karnataka.
2.  The 6th iteration of the draft notification by the Central Government declared less than 50,000 square kilometers of the Western Ghats as an ecologically sensitive area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Kasturirangan Committee's recommendation:  approximately 60,000 square kilometers designated as ESA, with the largest portion falling within Karnataka.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 6th draft notification declared 56,825.7 square kilometers as an ESA—a figure *more* than 50,000 square kilometers.  The statement misrepresents the actual area declared. Thus, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) and People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The BMC is mandated by the Biological Diversity Act (2002) to prepare the PBR, but it does not require consultation with local communities.
2. The PBR primarily focuses on documenting the economic value of local bioresources and associated traditional knowledge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Biological Diversity Act (2002) explicitly mandates BMCs to prepare PBRs *in consultation* with local people.  The collaborative nature of PBR creation is a crucial aspect of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PBR documents the uses of bioresources (including medicinal uses), its purpose is broader than just economic valuation.  It aims to document and safeguard bioresources and associated knowledge, encompassing cultural and traditional aspects as well.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The EPI 2024 ranked India among the top 50 countries globally, reflecting significant improvements in environmental performance.
2.  The EPI uses a comprehensive set of indicators to assess climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India was ranked 176th out of 180 countries in the EPI 2024,  not among the top 50. This shows a significantly low ranking, contradicting the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The EPI 2024 does indeed use a wide range of indicators (58 across 11 issue categories) to assess performance across climate change, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme:**

1. The MAB Programme was launched in 1971 with the primary goal of conserving biodiversity through the establishment of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries exclusively.
2.  Twelve of India's 18 biosphere reserves are currently recognized under the UNESCO MAB Programme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MAB Programme does contribute to biodiversity conservation, its aim is broader than just establishing national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. It focuses on establishing a scientific basis for enhancing the relationship between people and their environments.  The approach is holistic, not limited to protected areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that 12 out of India's 18 biosphere reserves have recognition under the UNESCO MAB Programme. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. NICES is a program operated solely by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
2. A primary objective of NICES is to generate and disseminate long-term Essential Climate Variables derived from Earth Observation satellites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ISRO plays a significant role, NICES is operated in collaboration with the Department of Space and other ministries under the framework of the National Action Plan on Climate Change.  It's not solely an ISRO initiative.

Statement 2 is correct. The generation and dissemination of long-term Essential Climate Variables from satellite data is a core function of the NICES Programme.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to the One Million Youth Actions Challenge (1MYAC), consider the following statements:**

1. 1MYAC is a program exclusively focused on promoting climate action among young people aged 10-30 years.
2.  1MYAC encourages youth participation in achieving four specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While climate action (SDG 13) is a key focus, 1MYAC promotes four SDGs, not just climate action.  The program's scope is broader than a singular focus on climate change.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that 1MYAC actively promotes four SDGs: SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 15 (life on land).  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's climate negotiation stance at UNFCCC-COP29:**

1. India proposed a goal of $1.3 trillion annually under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) framework, with half of this amount coming from grants or equivalent resources.
2. India supported the use of third-party databases for measuring progress on adaptation and opposed the establishment of the Baku Road Map.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  India did propose a significant annual financial commitment under the NDC framework, aiming for $1.3 trillion, with a substantial portion (approximately $600 billion) sought as grants or equivalent resources.  While the exact phrasing might differ slightly from the given statement, the core idea of a substantial financial commitment and a preference for grant-based funding aligns with India's position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's stance at COP29 was to *oppose* the use of third-party databases for measuring progress on adaptation, citing concerns about data accuracy and potential biases.  Furthermore, India *supported* the establishment of the Baku Road Map, indicating a willingness to engage in collaborative efforts to advance climate action.  The statement reverses India's actual positions on both these points.


**2. With reference to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The GEF Council approved funding exceeding $700 million for projects related to the Great Green Wall initiative and the Sustainable Cities Integrated Program (SCIP), excluding Indian projects.
2. The GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), but not for the Minamata Convention on Mercury.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GEF Council did indeed approve significant funding exceeding $700 million for projects including the Great Green Wall and SCIP, the statement falsely claims that *Indian* projects were excluded.  The text explicitly mentions two Indian projects receiving GEF funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GEF *does* serve as a financial mechanism for the Minamata Convention on Mercury, in addition to the UNCCD and other environmental conventions.  The statement incorrectly asserts its exclusion from one of the conventions it explicitly supports.


**3. With reference to India's carbon market and carbon trading mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS) 2023, established under amendments in the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022, includes a voluntary compliance mechanism for energy-intensive industries.
2. The Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, initially designed for large energy-intensive industries, will be completely replaced by the CCTS offset mechanism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCTS 2023 includes a *mandatory* compliance mechanism, not a voluntary one, for energy-intensive industries.  The voluntary component lies in the offset mechanism for entities not covered under the mandatory scheme.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the compliance mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PAT scheme will be *gradually transitioned* to the compliance mechanism under CCTS, not completely replaced by the offset mechanism.  A complete replacement is not mentioned in the provided text; instead, a gradual integration is indicated.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW):**

1. The GCEW is a commission convened by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a three-year mandate.
2.  The GCEW's report, "The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Good," focuses solely on the economic valuation of water resources, neglecting ecological aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCEW was launched by the Government of the Netherlands, not the OECD, and had a two-year, not three-year, mandate. The statement misattributes the convening entity and the duration of the commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCEW report explicitly addresses the valuation of the hydrological cycle as a *global common good*, thus encompassing ecological aspects alongside economic considerations. The statement wrongly limits the report's scope to purely economic aspects.


**5. With reference to the Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund, consider the following statements:**

1. The GFC Fund was established during the fourth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM4).
2. The GFC Fund primarily supports large-scale projects in high-income countries to strengthen their national capacities in chemicals and waste management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GFC Fund was established during the *fifth* ICCM (ICCM5), not the fourth.  A simple numerical error makes this statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GFC Fund targets *low- and middle-income countries*, focusing on *medium-scale* projects, not large-scale projects in high-income countries. The statement completely misrepresents the Fund's target beneficiaries and project scale.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) Programme:**

1. The NICES Programme, conceptualized in 2012, is solely operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
2. The NICES Programme's primary objective is to support international collaborative research efforts in climate change mitigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ISRO plays a significant role, the NICES Programme is operated *jointly* by ISRO, the Department of Space, and other ministries under the National Action Plan on Climate Change.  The statement incorrectly attributes sole operational control to ISRO.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NICES Programme does involve research, its primary objective is to support *Indian* researchers in combating climate change, not primarily international collaborations.  The statement misrepresents the program's focus.


**7. With reference to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), consider the following statements:**

1. The SBTi is a for-profit organization that develops standards for companies to set and achieve net-zero emissions targets.
2. The SBTi's partners include the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact, and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SBTi is a *not-for-profit* organization, not a for-profit entity. Its aim is to help companies set *science-based* targets, not necessarily net-zero targets, although net-zero is a common goal.  The statement incorrectly describes the SBTi's legal structure and its precise targets.

Statement 2 is correct. The listed organizations—CDP, UN Global Compact, and WWF—are indeed partners of the SBTi.  This statement accurately reflects the SBTi's collaborative network.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI):**

1. The CPI's 2024 report, "Global Landscape of Climate Finance," indicated a decline in renewable energy investment in 2023 compared to 2022.
2. The CPI was founded in 2009 to support nations in developing and implementing effective climate policies, with a primary focus on developed countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPI's 2024 report actually showed a *key increase* in renewable energy investment in 2023. The statement misrepresents a key finding of the report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPI does support nations in developing and implementing effective climate policies, its focus is not limited to developed countries; it supports *nations building low-carbon economies*, encompassing both developed and developing nations. The statement wrongly restricts the CPI's scope.


**9. With reference to the Just Energy Transition, consider the following statements:**

1. The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), launched at COP26, is a solely bilateral initiative between India and the United States.
2. The International Labour Organization (ILO) guidelines for a Just Transition emphasize equity, inclusion, and sustainability as key elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JETP is not solely a bilateral initiative between India and the U.S.; it involves multiple countries and partners. The statement incorrectly limits the scope and participants of the JETP.

Statement 2 is correct. The ILO guidelines for a Just Transition do indeed highlight equity, inclusion, and sustainability as core principles.  This statement accurately reflects the ILO's framework for a just transition.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme:**

1. The IDWH scheme is a state-sponsored initiative primarily focused on protecting wildlife within protected areas.
2.  The IDWH scheme's funding is solely derived from the state governments' budgets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IDWH scheme is a *centrally sponsored* scheme, not solely state-sponsored, and it focuses on protecting wildlife both *inside* and *outside* protected areas. The statement misrepresents the scheme's funding source and scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IDWH scheme receives funding from the *central government*, making it a centrally sponsored scheme.  The statement wrongly attributes funding solely to state governments.


**1. With reference to Fungi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fungi exhibit a wide range of diversity, encompassing both single-celled and complex multicellular organisms, and are found across diverse geographical regions, including tropical, temperate, and arctic zones.
2.  The primary mode of nutrition in fungi is autotrophic, relying on photosynthesis for energy production, and their cell walls are composed primarily of cellulose.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Fungi indeed display remarkable diversity, ranging from unicellular yeasts to complex multicellular mushrooms and molds. Their distribution spans a wide array of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across various climatic zones, from the tropics to the Arctic.  This broad diversity is a key characteristic of the Kingdom Fungi.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, meaning they cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis like plants. Instead, they obtain nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment. This can be achieved through saprophytic means (decomposing dead organic matter) or parasitic means (living off a host organism).  Furthermore, fungal cell walls are predominantly composed of chitin, not cellulose, which is the primary structural component of plant cell walls.  The presence of chitin is a defining characteristic that distinguishes fungal cell walls from those of plants.


**2. With reference to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), consider the following statements:**

1. POPs are primarily inorganic substances that persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in living organisms, exhibiting high water solubility and volatility.
2. The Stockholm Convention is an international agreement aimed at regulating POPs, with India ratifying it in 2006 and establishing the "Regulation of POP Rules, 2018" under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. POPs are organic (carbon-based) substances, not inorganic.  Their persistence stems from their resistance to degradation through various processes (photolytic, biological, and chemical).  Crucially, POPs are characterized by low water solubility and high lipid solubility. This high lipid solubility is what facilitates their bioaccumulation in living organisms, moving up the food chain. Their semi-volatility allows for long-distance atmospheric transport before deposition.


Statement 2 is correct. The Stockholm Convention is indeed a legally binding international agreement focusing on the elimination or reduction of POPs. India did ratify this convention in 2006, and subsequently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) implemented the "Regulation of POP Rules, 2018" under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to regulate these harmful substances within the country.


**3. With reference to Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies, consider the following statements:**

1.  CDR encompasses anthropogenic activities that remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it temporarily in terrestrial reservoirs, such as forests, but not in geological or ocean reservoirs.
2.  Enhanced weathering, a CDR technology, involves the mining of rocks containing minerals that naturally absorb CO2, while Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) utilizes biomass for energy production, capturing and storing the resulting biogenic carbon geologically.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CDR technologies aim for *durable* storage of atmospheric CO2, which includes geological and ocean reservoirs as well as terrestrial ones.  The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report emphasizes the importance of CDR across various storage mechanisms to achieve net-zero emissions.  The statement's limitation to only temporary terrestrial storage is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Enhanced weathering is a valid CDR method using naturally occurring mineral reactions to sequester CO2.  BECCS is also a recognized technology that combines biomass energy with carbon capture and geological storage of the biogenic carbon produced during biomass combustion.  Both these methods are actively researched and implemented as part of broader strategies to mitigate climate change.


**4. With reference to the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR), consider the following statements:**

1. BRSR is a voluntary disclosure mechanism for top 1000 listed companies in India to report their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, introduced in FY 2023-24.
2.  The 2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report, released by the New Climate Institute in collaboration with Carbon Market Watch, assesses the transparency and integrity of climate strategies of major global companies, including those adhering to BRSR.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. BRSR is a *mandatory* disclosure mechanism, not voluntary, for the top 1000 listed companies in India.  It was introduced in FY 2022-23, not 2023-24, to enhance transparency and accountability regarding ESG performance.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 CCRM report, a collaborative effort by the New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch, does indeed evaluate the climate strategies of major global companies.  While the report's scope is broader than just BRSR-adhering companies, it's relevant because BRSR is a significant step towards improving the quality and consistency of ESG reporting in India, a factor that the CCRM report would likely consider in its assessment of companies' climate strategies.


**5. With reference to Microplastics, consider the following statements:**

1. Microplastics are plastic pieces larger than 5 millimeters in length, primarily originating from the breakdown of larger plastic items.
2.  The impacts of microplastics include environmental harm through ingestion by marine organisms, disrupting the food chain, and potential human health risks such as gastrointestinal problems, endocrine disruption, and respiratory issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The definition of microplastics specifies that they are smaller than 5 millimeters in length, not larger.  While the breakdown of larger plastics contributes significantly to secondary microplastics, primary microplastics also exist as tiny particles intentionally manufactured for use in various products (cosmetics, clothing, etc.).

Statement 2 is correct. The negative impacts of microplastics are well-documented.  Their ingestion by marine organisms leads to bioaccumulation and the disruption of marine food webs.  Human exposure pathways are also concerning, potentially leading to a range of health problems as mentioned in the statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Speciation events can produce more than one new species.  While allopatric speciation involves geographic isolation, other modes of speciation, such as sympatric, parapatric, and peripatric, also exist.  The statement's exclusive focus on allopatric speciation is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. Sympatric speciation, the formation of new species within the same geographic area, is a valid mode of speciation.  The example of Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers coexisting in the Indian subcontinent for a considerable period is often cited to illustrate the possibility of sympatric speciation, although the precise mechanisms involved might be complex and debated.  The key point is that the statement accurately reflects the potential for sympatric speciation to occur without geographic barriers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While increased aluminum toxicity is detrimental to plant health, it doesn't directly reduce the availability of phosphorus.  Acidification itself makes phosphorus less soluble, reducing its availability to plants. Aluminum toxicity further compounds the problem by damaging plant roots, hindering their ability to absorb nutrients, including phosphorus, but it's not the direct cause of phosphorus unavailability.  The reduced availability of phosphorus is a direct consequence of the lowered pH.


**10. With reference to the use of industrial by-products in managing acid soils, consider the following statements:**

1. Basic slags from the iron and steel industry are a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option for soil amendment compared to lime, but their use is limited by their inconsistent chemical composition.
2. Press mud from the sugarcane industry, when used as a soil amendment, can improve soil structure and water retention capacity in addition to neutralizing soil acidity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While basic slags can be a cost-effective alternative to lime in some situations, their environmental friendliness is not universally accepted.  Concerns exist regarding potential heavy metal contamination, similar to other industrial by-products.  The inconsistent chemical composition is a valid limitation, making it challenging to standardize application rates and predict the effects accurately.  Lime remains a widely used and well-understood amendment for soil acidity.

Statement 2 is correct. Press mud, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, has shown promise as a soil amendment.  In addition to its alkaline properties, it can improve soil structure and water retention capacity, enhancing overall soil health.  Its organic matter content contributes to improved soil aggregation and water-holding capacity, benefiting plant growth.  However, as with other industrial byproducts, careful management is needed to avoid potential issues.


**1. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB is a constitutional body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, with the primary mandate of monitoring air and water quality.
2.  The CPCB, in collaboration with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), is responsible for implementing environmental legislations, including those related to the promotion of cleanliness in water bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and later given powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection, but the CPCB's establishment predates it. The primary mandate is indeed monitoring air and water quality, but the act of establishment is incorrectly stated.

Statement 2 is correct. The CPCB, along with the SPCBs, plays a crucial role in implementing environmental legislation related to pollution control.  This includes promoting the cleanliness of streams and wells, aligning with its broader aim to improve air and water quality across the nation.  The collaborative nature of implementation between the CPCB and SPCBs is accurate. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

1. The NGT functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and primarily handles cases related to environmental violations reported by the CPCB.
2. The NGT's orders are binding and directly enforceable, overriding any decisions made by state-level environmental bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the NGT's jurisdiction extends beyond just cases reported by the CPCB,  it does indeed function under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and frequently receives cases related to environmental violations, often stemming from CPCB reports or citizen complaints.  However, it's important to note that the NGT's scope is much broader than just CPCB referrals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NGT orders carry significant weight and are meant to be implemented, they are not always directly enforceable and can be challenged through the judicial process.  State-level environmental bodies may have their own jurisdictions and processes, and the NGT's orders do not automatically override all state-level decisions.  The interplay between NGT orders and state-level actions is complex and not a simple case of direct override.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDG India Index 2023-24, released by NITI Aayog, assesses the progress of all States and Union Territories (UTs) on 17 goals, covering a total of 232 indicators.
2.  A score of 100 indicates that a State/UT has completely achieved all the targets set for 2030 under the SDGs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SDG India Index 2023-24 uses 113 indicators, not 232, aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework.  While the index covers progress across the 17 SDGs, the number of indicators used is significantly fewer than stated.

Statement 2 is correct. A perfect score of 100 on the SDG India Index signifies that a particular State or Union Territory has fully met all the targets set for the year 2030 as per the SDG framework.  This is a key feature of the index's scoring system.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCEW, convened by the Government of France, released a report emphasizing the economic valuation of water resources, promoting sustainable water management practices.
2. The GCEW’s composition includes a diverse range of experts from various fields, including policymakers, researchers, and representatives from international organizations like the World Bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. The GFC Fund was established during ICCM5, not ICCM4, and it focuses on supporting low- and middle-income countries, not high-income countries, in addressing chemicals and waste management.  The target beneficiaries and the conference at which it was established are both inaccurate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the executive board does include national representatives from each UN region and representatives of donors and contributors, major international financial institutions are not explicitly mentioned as being represented.  The composition is partially accurate but overstates the level of representation from international financial institutions.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**6. With reference to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  NDCs are voluntary commitments made by countries under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
2. India's NDCs at COP29 included a proposal for a quantified goal on climate finance, advocating for a significant portion of the funding to come from grants or equivalent resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NDCs are commitments made under the Paris Agreement, not the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol had a different mechanism for emission reduction targets.  The treaty under which NDCs are submitted is a crucial point of distinction.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's stance at COP29 included a proposal for a significant increase in climate finance, specifically advocating for a substantial portion (a proposed $600 billion) to originate from grants or equivalent resources within the context of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG).  India's position on climate finance at COP29 is accurately described.


**7. With reference to the Global Stocktake (GST), consider the following statements:**

1. The GST is a process under the UNFCCC to assess the collective progress of countries towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement every five years.
2. India, at COP29, supported the establishment of enhanced follow-up mechanisms for GST outcomes, emphasizing the need for stricter accountability measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Global Stocktake (GST) is indeed a process under the Paris Agreement (which falls under the UNFCCC) designed to evaluate the collective progress of nations in meeting the Paris Agreement's objectives. The process occurs every five years.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India at COP29 actually *opposed* enhanced follow-up mechanisms for GST outcomes, expressing concerns about the potential for imbalance and a lack of focus on financial aspects in the proposed mechanisms.  India's position was critical, not supportive, of these enhanced mechanisms.


**8. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA is a national framework for compiling environmental statistics, primarily focused on measuring the economic value of natural resources within a country's borders.
2.  The SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) component of the SEEA focuses on measuring the economic value of individual resources like timber, water, and fish, while SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) focuses on ecosystem services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEA is an *international* framework, not a national one, for compiling environmental-economic accounts.  It's designed to be applied globally, not just within a single country's borders.  While it does measure the economic value of natural resources, this is just one aspect of its broader scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SEEA-CF measures environmental assets and individual resources (like timber, water, and fish) and how the economy uses them, while the SEEA-EA focuses on measuring ecosystems and the services they provide.  The roles of SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA are reversed in the statement.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**9. With reference to Biosphere Reserves in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All 18 Biosphere Reserves in India are recognized under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme.
2. The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve was the second Biosphere Reserve in India to be recognized under the MAB Programme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Only 12 out of the 18 Biosphere Reserves in India are currently recognized under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme.  The number of recognized reserves is significantly less than stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve was the *first*, not the second, Biosphere Reserve in India to be recognized under the MAB Programme.  The order of recognition is reversed.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.

**1. With reference to the characteristics of Glacial Lakes, consider the following statements:**

1. Glacial lakes are exclusively found in the Himalayan region of India, primarily fed by melting glaciers.
2. All glacial lakes are categorized as Moraine-dammed lakes, where water is contained by a moraine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a significant number of glacial lakes are found in the Himalayas, glacial lakes can exist in other mountainous regions globally where glaciers are present.  The statement incorrectly restricts their location solely to the Himalayas and ignores the global distribution of glacial lakes.  The Himalayan region is indeed a significant area for glacial lakes, but it's not the only location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Glacial lakes are categorized into several types based on the nature of their damming mechanism.  While Moraine-dammed lakes (where water is held back by a moraine – a deposit of unconsolidated glacial debris) are a common type, other types exist, including Ice-dammed lakes (where ice acts as a dam), Erosion lakes (formed in depressions carved by glacial erosion), and other types based on their formation.  The statement's oversimplification of glacial lake categorization is misleading.  The diversity in the formation and characteristics of glacial lakes necessitates a more nuanced understanding than what the statement provides.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the UN-REDD Programme:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlights that a majority of the top twenty countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have successfully incorporated quantified forest targets into their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The UN-REDD Programme focuses solely on afforestation and reforestation initiatives to mitigate climate change, neglecting the critical role of reducing deforestation.

2. Tropical cyclones are purely an oceanic phenomenon, whereas tornadoes primarily develop over land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tropical cyclones need minimal vertical wind shear to maintain their structure. Strong wind shear disrupts the organized convection that fuels the cyclone.  Tornadoes, conversely, thrive in environments with significant vertical wind shear, which contributes to their intense rotation. The difference in wind shear requirements reflects the vastly different scales and dynamics of these two weather phenomena.

Statement 2 is also correct. Tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm ocean waters and require the Coriolis effect for their rotation, limiting their formation to tropical oceans. Tornadoes, on the other hand, are associated with thunderstorms that develop over land. While waterspouts (tornadoes over water) exist, the vast majority of tornadoes form over landmasses.  The distinct formation environments highlight the fundamental differences in their energy sources and atmospheric conditions.


**2. With reference to the impacts of Global Warming on Cyclone Formation, consider the following statements:**

1. Global warming leads to a decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones globally, but an increase in their intensity in specific regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the overall global frequency of tropical cyclones is a complex issue with ongoing research, the consensus is not a simple decrease.  Studies suggest that while the total number might not drastically increase, the intensity of cyclones is likely to increase due to warmer ocean temperatures. The impact of global warming on cyclone frequency varies regionally.

Statement 2 is correct.  Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) provide more energy for cyclone development.  This increased energy input leads to several observed changes in Southeast Asian cyclones, including formation closer to the coast (reducing lead times for warnings), more rapid intensification (making them more dangerous), and longer durations over land (increasing the extent of damage).  The link between warmer SSTs and these observed changes is well-established in climate science.

1. IDWH exclusively focuses on supporting protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
2.  The Species Recovery Program under IDWH has successfully revived over 50 critically endangered species and their habitats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IDWH does provide support to protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves), it also has a crucial component focused on protecting wildlife *outside* protected areas.  This highlights the scheme's broader approach to wildlife conservation, recognizing that habitat protection extends beyond formally designated zones.  The scheme aims for a holistic approach to conservation, understanding that wildlife often moves and needs protection in areas not specifically designated as protected areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that 22 species have been identified under the Species Recovery Program so far.  This is significantly less than 50, indicating an overestimation in the statement. The success of species recovery programs is often a long-term process, with varying degrees of success depending on the species and its specific challenges.  While the program aims for the revival of critically endangered species and their habitats, the claim of over 50 successful revivals is unsubstantiated by the provided information.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PBRs are statutorily recognized under the Biological Diversity Act of 2002, not the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.  The Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) are responsible for preparing PBRs in consultation with local people, not solely the Panchayats. While Panchayats may play a significant role in the process, the legal mandate and responsibility lie with the BMCs established under the Biological Diversity Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary purpose of a PBR is to document and safeguard bioresources and associated traditional knowledge, not to facilitate commercial exploitation.  While sustainable resource management is a goal, the focus is on conservation and preservation of biodiversity and the associated knowledge systems of local communities. Commercial exploitation is not the central aim; rather, it's about responsible and sustainable use.


**3. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The EPI 2024 ranks countries based solely on their performance in mitigating climate change.
2.  India's ranking in the EPI 2024 reflects a significant improvement in its environmental performance compared to previous years.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EPI 2024 uses 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories, encompassing climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality.  It's not limited to climate change mitigation alone; it offers a broader assessment of environmental performance.  A holistic assessment is crucial, as environmental issues are interconnected and require a multi-faceted approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that India ranked 176th out of 180 countries in the EPI 2024.  This does not suggest a significant improvement compared to previous years; instead, it highlights areas needing attention and improvement in India's environmental performance. While specific year-to-year comparisons are not provided in the given text, the low ranking itself indicates a need for substantial improvement.


**4. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NCI 2024 primarily assesses countries based on their financial investments in environmental conservation.
2.  India's low ranking in the NCI 2024 is attributed to its limited capacity and governance in environmental protection.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCI 2024 evaluates conservation efforts using four markers: land management, threats to biodiversity, capacity and governance, and future trends.  Financial investment is not the sole or even primary factor; the index takes a broader perspective on the effectiveness of conservation strategies and policies.  A purely financial metric would not capture the nuances of conservation challenges and successes.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  India's rank of 176 out of 180 countries in the NCI 2024 suggests weaknesses in capacity and governance related to environmental protection. However, it's important to note that the low ranking is likely due to a combination of factors, including land management practices, threats to biodiversity, and future trends. While capacity and governance are significant contributing factors, the statement is not entirely accurate in isolating them as the sole cause.

2. The Ramsar Convention came into force globally in 1971.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that a wetland must meet *at least one* of the nine criteria defined by the Ramsar Convention, not all nine.  The criteria are designed to identify sites of international importance for wetland conservation, and meeting even one criterion is sufficient for consideration.  Requiring all nine would be overly restrictive and limit the number of designated wetlands.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ramsar Convention was adopted in 1971, but it came into force in 1975, not 1971.  There is a distinction between the adoption of a treaty and its entry into force, with the latter requiring ratification by a sufficient number of signatory states. The delay between adoption and entry into force is common for international treaties.


**6. With reference to Mangrove Conservation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems classifies all mangrove ecosystems in India as critically endangered.
2. The MISHTI initiative is solely focused on financial investments in mangrove restoration projects.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the mangrove ecosystems of *south India*, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and the Northwest Atlantic were identified as critically endangered.  This doesn't imply that *all* mangrove ecosystems in India are critically endangered; other regions, like the Andaman and Bay of Bengal, are classified as least concern.  The IUCN assessment provides a nuanced picture, indicating varying levels of threat across different geographical locations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes) initiative aims for a comprehensive approach to mangrove conservation, going beyond just financial investment. While funding is a component, the initiative also works towards shoreline habitat restoration and generating tangible incomes for local communities.  A multi-pronged strategy is crucial for effective mangrove conservation, addressing both ecological and socio-economic aspects.


**7. With reference to the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The FAC has the authority to overrule the decisions of state governments regarding forest land diversion.
2. The FAC's role is purely advisory, and its recommendations are not legally binding.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FAC plays a crucial role in approving or rejecting proposals for forest land diversion, it does not have the authority to overrule state government decisions.  Its recommendations are considered, but the final decision rests with the central government, taking into account various factors, including state government views.  The FAC's role is to provide expert advice and assessment, not to dictate policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the role of the FAC is recommendatory in nature concerning the diversion of forest land for non-forestry use.  Its assessments and recommendations are influential, but they are not legally binding.  The final decision rests with the relevant authorities, considering the FAC's input alongside other factors.


**8. With reference to Biosphere Reserves, consider the following statements:**

1.  All Biosphere Reserves in India are recognized under UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme.
2.  A Biosphere Reserve's core area is designated for intensive human activities to promote sustainable development.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that out of 18 biosphere reserves in India, 12 are recognized under UNESCO's MAB Programme. This means that not all Indian biosphere reserves have this international recognition.  The MAB recognition signifies adherence to specific standards and criteria for biosphere reserve management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The core area of a Biosphere Reserve is strictly protected, with minimal human intervention.  It's intended to preserve biodiversity and ecological processes, not to support intensive human activities.  The buffer and transition zones are where sustainable development activities are encouraged, but the core area maintains its pristine character for scientific research and conservation.


**9. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ESZs are notified by state governments under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
2. The Kasturirangan Committee report recommended that only a small percentage of the Western Ghats be designated as an ESZ.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ESZs are notified by the *central* government, not state governments, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  While state governments may be involved in the process, the legal authority for ESZ notification rests with the central government.  This ensures consistency and national standards in the designation of ESZs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kasturirangan Committee report proposed that 37% of the total area of the Western Ghats (roughly 60,000 square kilometers) be designated as an Eco-Sensitive Area.  This is a substantial portion of the region, reflecting the committee's emphasis on protecting the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats.  The statement underestimates the committee's recommendation.


**10. With reference to the UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. UN-REDD primarily focuses on afforestation and reforestation efforts to mitigate climate change.
2.  A majority of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UN-REDD addresses afforestation and reforestation, its primary focus is on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.  Reducing deforestation is a critical step before focusing on afforestation and reforestation, as it tackles the root cause of emissions from forest loss.  The program's name itself emphasizes this priority.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UN-REDD report indicates that only 8 of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have quantified targets on forests in their NDCs.  This highlights a significant gap in the global effort to address deforestation, with a majority of the high-deforestation countries lacking specific and measurable forest targets in their climate action plans.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems assessed 36 regions across 44 countries and classified approximately 50% of the examined ecosystems as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.  This assessment is a key indicator for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
2.  According to the State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report, mangrove ecosystems in the Lakshadweep archipelago and along the coast of Tamil Nadu are categorized as vulnerable, while those in the Andaman and Bay of Bengal are classified as least concern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IUCN Red List assessment of mangrove ecosystems, encompassing 36 regions across 44 countries, indeed revealed that about 50% of the assessed ecosystems fell into the vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered categories.  This aligns with its role as a headline indicator for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report actually indicates that the mangroves in the Lakshadweep archipelago and along the coast of Tamil Nadu are critically endangered, not vulnerable. The Andaman and Bay of Bengal mangroves are correctly identified as being of least concern. The discrepancy in the vulnerability classification for the Lakshadweep and Tamil Nadu mangroves makes statement 2 inaccurate.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall precise details from different reports on mangrove conservation.


**2. With reference to India's mangrove conservation initiatives, consider the following statements:**

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on environmental issues and adhering to all specified guidelines.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's stance at COP29:**

1. India proposed a goal of $1.3 trillion annually under the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG), with half of this amount coming from grants or equivalent resources.
2. India unequivocally supported the use of third-party databases for measuring progress on adaptation and endorsed the UAE dialogue text in its entirety.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. India did propose a $1.3 trillion annual goal under the NCQG, but the text specifies that $600 billion should come from grants or equivalent resources, not half the total amount.  This slight inaccuracy doesn't negate the core truth of the statement.  The emphasis on grant-based funding reflects India's position on equitable burden-sharing in climate finance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India actively *opposed* the use of third-party databases for measuring adaptation progress, citing concerns about data accuracy and potential biases.  Furthermore, India criticized the UAE dialogue text for its lack of connection to finance, imbalance, and mitigation-centric language; therefore, it did not endorse it fully.  This highlights India's cautious approach to international climate agreements and its advocacy for a more balanced and equitable approach.


**2. With reference to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 6.8, the non-market-based approach, involves the trading of emission reductions between participating parties.
2. The "corresponding adjustment" under Article 6.2 refers to changes made in a country's emissions levels to reflect the transfer (export) or acquisition (import) of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 6.8, the non-market-based approach, explicitly *does not* involve the trading of emission reductions. Its focus is on cooperation and support for mitigation and adaptation efforts without a formal market mechanism.  This distinguishes it from the market-based approaches (Article 6.2 and 6.4).

Statement 2 is correct. The "corresponding adjustment" is a crucial element of Article 6.2, ensuring that the transfer of ITMOs doesn't lead to double-counting of emission reductions.  Countries adjust their reported emissions to reflect the actual impact of these transfers, maintaining transparency and integrity in the carbon accounting process.  This mechanism is vital for preventing loopholes and ensuring the effectiveness of international carbon markets.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Liming is a standard practice for ameliorating soil acidity. The materials mentioned (lime, gypsum, dolomite) are all effective liming agents, increasing the soil pH and reducing aluminum toxicity. This direct approach targets the root cause of acidity.

Statement 2 is also correct. While not addressing the underlying cause, growing acid-tolerant crops is a pragmatic management strategy. These crops can thrive even in acidic conditions, preventing complete crop failure and allowing for continued agricultural productivity in affected areas.  It's a useful adaptation, but not a solution to the underlying problem of soil acidification, which often needs to be addressed through methods like liming. The combined use of both strategies is a holistic approach reflecting the complexity of managing acid soils.


**3. With reference to the "grasshopper effect," consider the following statements:**

1. The "grasshopper effect" describes the phenomenon where persistent pollutants, like plastics and toxic chemicals, are transported long distances via atmospheric and oceanic currents, concentrating in polar regions like the Arctic.
2. The Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) released a report highlighting the grasshopper effect's contribution to the Arctic's plastic crisis, but this report did not emphasize the accumulation of pollutants as a "hemispheric sink."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the grasshopper effect.  It emphasizes the long-range transport of pollutants through atmospheric and oceanic currents, leading to their accumulation in polar regions. This process is a significant contributor to environmental pollution in these seemingly remote areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While ACAT and IPEN did release a report on the Arctic's plastic crisis, the report explicitly highlighted the Arctic as a "hemispheric sink" for these pollutants, emphasizing the significant accumulation resulting from the grasshopper effect. The description of the report's findings in statement 2 is therefore inaccurate, making (a) the only correct option.


**4. With reference to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), consider the following statements:**

1. GLOFs are sudden releases of water from glacial lakes, primarily caused by geological factors such as earthquakes and the breaching of moraine dams, and are not influenced by climatic factors.
2.  India's National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) 2019 recognizes GLOFs as a potential climatological disaster, and initiatives such as the National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS) are underway to address GLOF risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While geological factors like earthquakes and moraine dam breaches are significant contributors to GLOFs, the statement inaccurately excludes climatic factors.  Climatic changes, such as increased precipitation and glacial melting due to warming temperatures, significantly influence the formation, size, and instability of glacial lakes, thus increasing GLOF risk.  This makes the statement an oversimplification of a complex phenomenon.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDMP 2019 rightly identifies GLOFs as a major threat, and the NMHS is a crucial initiative focused on understanding and mitigating GLOF risks in the Himalayan region.  The NMHS involves research, monitoring, and risk assessment to help prevent and manage these catastrophic events.  The inclusion of NMHS highlights the proactive approach being taken by India.


**5. With reference to the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR), consider the following statements:**

1. BRSR is a mandatory disclosure mechanism for all listed companies in India, requiring them to report their performance on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, including specific key performance indicators (KPIs).
2. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced BRSR Core in 2023 to enhance the reliability of ESG disclosures, but this initiative is not related to the 2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While BRSR is indeed mandatory for the top 1000 listed companies in India,  it doesn't encompass *all* listed companies.  The statement overgeneralizes the scope of BRSR.  The requirement of reporting on ESG aspects and KPIs is accurate, but the blanket inclusion of "all listed companies" is false.

Statement 2 is correct. SEBI's introduction of BRSR Core aims to improve the quality and reliability of ESG disclosures.  The CCRM report, while also focusing on ESG performance, is an independent assessment by a different organization (New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch).  Therefore, while both relate to ESG reporting, they are distinct initiatives, making statement 2 correct.  The distinction between the SEBI initiative and the independent CCRM report shows a nuanced understanding of regulatory and independent assessments of corporate sustainability.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may focus more on organizations and initiatives than strictly environmental topics, as the provided text blends environmental issues with related policy and organizational contexts.


**1. With reference to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a legally binding agreement adopted at the 2nd UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction.
2.  The framework defines Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) as systematic efforts to analyze and mitigate causal factors of disasters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sendai Framework was adopted at the *3rd* UN World Conference on DRR in 2015, not the 2nd.  It's also important to note that while the framework sets targets and promotes action, it is *not* legally binding in the same way as a treaty.  Statement 2 is correct. The Sendai Framework explicitly defines DRR as systematic efforts to understand and reduce disaster risks by analyzing and mitigating causal factors. This reflects a shift towards proactive risk management rather than solely reactive disaster response.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the framework's legal status and its definition of DRR.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN):**

1.  The CTCN is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and works primarily with developed nations to transfer climate-friendly technologies.
2. The CTCN is hosted by the UN Environment Programme and focuses on accelerating the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CTCN's headquarters are in Copenhagen, Denmark, not Geneva.  Furthermore, its primary focus is on supporting *developing* countries, not developed ones, in their efforts to adopt climate-friendly technologies. Statement 2 is correct. The CTCN is indeed hosted by the UN Environment Programme and works to accelerate the transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing nations to promote low-carbon and climate-resilient development. This is a key aspect of its mandate within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The other options are incorrect due to the errors in the location of headquarters and the target beneficiary countries of the CTCN.


**3. With reference to the Stockholm Convention, consider the following statements:**

1. The Stockholm Convention is a legally binding agreement focusing solely on regulating Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in developed nations.
2. India ratified the Stockholm Convention in 2006, and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) implemented the ‘Regulation of POP Rules, 2018’.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Stockholm Convention is a global, legally binding agreement that applies to all signatory nations, not just developed countries. While it primarily addresses POPs, its scope encompasses international cooperation and actions to reduce their production, use, and release into the environment. Statement 2 is correct.  India did indeed ratify the Stockholm Convention in 2006, and the MoEFCC subsequently implemented the 'Regulation of POP Rules, 2018' under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to meet the convention's obligations.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the scope of the convention and India's participation.



**4. With reference to the Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2024 report by the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), consider the following statements:**

1. The report found that climate finance flows decreased significantly in 2023 compared to previous years, primarily due to reduced investment in renewable energy.
2. The report indicated a continued increase in annual fossil fuel investment and consumer fossil fuel subsidies since 2020, despite growing investments in renewable energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPI report actually showed that climate finance flows *exceeded* USD 1.5 trillion in 2023, with key increases observed in renewable energy and low-carbon transport.  This contradicts the claim of a significant decrease. Statement 2 is correct. A key finding of the report highlighted the concerning trend of continued annual increases in fossil fuel investment and subsidies since 2020, despite the growth in renewable energy investment.  This points to a persistent challenge in the global transition to a low-carbon economy. The other options are incorrect because they misinterpret the key findings of the CPI report on climate finance.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NICES programme is related to climate and environmental studies, it's not operated solely by the MoEFCC.  It involves a collaborative effort between various organizations and ministries. Statement 2 is correct. The NICES programme was indeed conceptualized in 2012 and operates under the framework of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, with participation from ISRO, the Department of Space, and other relevant ministries.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the organizational structure and collaborative nature of the NICES programme.


**1. With reference to Wetlands, consider the following statements:**

1.  Wetlands, covering only 6% of the Earth's surface, support approximately 40% of global biodiversity, acting as biodiversity hotspots and functioning as the "kidneys of the Earth" by absorbing heavy metals and excess nutrients.
2.  The Ramsar Convention, adopted in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, mandates that all wetlands must meet at least one of nine criteria for inclusion in the Ramsar List, focusing primarily on the conservation of migratory bird populations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Wetlands are indeed biodiversity hotspots, disproportionately supporting a vast array of species despite their relatively small global coverage. Their role in filtering pollutants, including heavy metals and excess nutrients, is well-established, earning them the moniker "kidneys of the Earth."  This statement accurately reflects the ecological significance of wetlands.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ramsar Convention was indeed adopted in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, and aims for the conservation and wise use of wetlands, its criteria for inclusion in the Ramsar List are far broader than solely focusing on migratory bird populations.  The convention considers various ecological, biological, and hydrological factors in determining a wetland's international importance.  The statement oversimplifies the complex criteria used for designating Ramsar sites.  The emphasis on migratory birds is one criterion among many, not the sole determinant.


**2. With reference to Fungi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fungi are primarily autotrophic organisms, exhibiting a diverse range of reproductive strategies, including sexual and asexual reproduction through spores, and playing a crucial role in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling within ecosystems.
2.  The IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) and the Global Fungal Red List Initiative are international organizations dedicated to the conservation of fungal diversity, with Chile being the only country to legally recognize fungi in its conservation laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fungi are heterotrophic, not autotrophic. They obtain their nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment, either as saprophytes (decomposers) or parasites. While they do play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling,  describing their nutrition as autotrophic is a fundamental error.  Their reproductive strategies are diverse, including both sexual and asexual methods using spores, but this fact doesn't correct the primary inaccuracy regarding their mode of nutrition.

Statement 2 is correct. The IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) and the Global Fungal Red List Initiative are indeed key players in international fungal conservation efforts.  The fact that Chile is currently the only country with specific legal provisions for fungal conservation highlights the relative neglect of fungi in global conservation strategies, making this statement factually accurate.


**3. With reference to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The WNBR, established under UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme in 1971, currently comprises over 750 sites across more than 130 countries, with India hosting 18 biosphere reserves, all recognized under the MAB Programme.
2. Biosphere reserves are primarily designed for ex-situ conservation, encompassing three zones: core areas for strict protection, buffer zones for research and education, and transition areas for sustainable community development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The WNBR, established under UNESCO's MAB Programme, does indeed comprise a significant number of sites globally. The number of sites and countries may vary slightly depending on the most recent updates, but the overall description is accurate. The statement accurately reflects the general scale of the WNBR and India's participation.  The number of Indian biosphere reserves recognized under the MAB program is also consistent with information available.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Biosphere reserves are fundamentally designed for *in-situ* conservation, not ex-situ.  Ex-situ conservation involves preserving species outside their natural habitats (e.g., zoos, botanical gardens). In contrast, biosphere reserves aim to conserve species and ecosystems within their natural environments. The three-zone structure (core, buffer, transition) is correctly described, but the fundamental purpose of in-situ conservation is misrepresented.


**4. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ESZs, notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, are areas with identified environmental resources requiring special attention for conservation, with the Kasturirangan Committee recommending a 37% ESZ designation for the Western Ghats, primarily focusing on Karnataka and Maharashtra.
2.  The High-Level Working Group (HLWG), headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, proposed color-coding industries within ESZs and extending Entry 20 (Economic Planning) of the Concurrent List to regulate development within an ecological framework, but these proposals have been fully implemented across all ESZs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  ESZs are indeed notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and are designated to protect environmentally sensitive areas. The Kasturirangan Committee's recommendations regarding the Western Ghats, including the proposed percentage for ESZ designation and the focus on Karnataka and Maharashtra, are generally accurate.  While the exact figures might have slight variations depending on the latest updates, the core information is correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the HLWG headed by Dr. Kasturirangan did propose color-coding industries and extending Entry 20 of the Concurrent List,  it is inaccurate to state that these proposals have been *fully implemented* across all ESZs in India.  The implementation of such recommendations is a complex process, and it's unlikely that all aspects have been uniformly implemented across the nation's diverse ESZs. The statement presents an oversimplification of a complex policy landscape.


**5.  With reference to the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI), consider the following statements:**

1.  FERI, a partnership between the Korea Forest Service (KFS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, primarily focuses on assisting developed nations in achieving their national biodiversity targets, particularly Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 14, and 15, and supports the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF).
2.  FERI's key initiatives include the adoption of a Short-Term Action Plan on Ecosystem Restoration (STAPER) at COP13 in 2016 and the development of WePlan – Forests Platform, a decision support tool for tropical forest ecosystem restoration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  FERI's primary focus is on assisting *developing*, not developed, countries in meeting their national biodiversity targets aligned with the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF).  The statement misrepresents the target beneficiaries of this initiative.

Statement 2 is correct. The adoption of STAPER at COP13 in 2016 and the development of the WePlan platform are indeed key initiatives undertaken by FERI to support ecosystem restoration efforts, particularly in tropical forests. This accurately reflects the work and goals of the initiative.


**6. With reference to the European Union's Nature Restoration Plan (NRP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NRP, a continent-wide law under the European Green Deal, aims to recover at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050, focusing primarily on restoring degraded forests and wetlands.
2.  The NRP's implementation relies on National Restoration Plans developed by individual EU countries, covering existing legislation for wetlands, forests, grasslands, and pollinating insects, but excludes marine ecosystems from its scope.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The NRP does aim for the restoration of a significant portion of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030 and 2050 respectively. The focus on various ecosystems, including forests and wetlands, is accurate. While the specific percentage and timelines might be subject to minor revisions, the overall goal and scope are correctly described.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NRP's implementation does rely on National Restoration Plans from individual EU countries, and it does cover various habitats including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and pollinating insects. However,  it is inaccurate to say that it *excludes* marine ecosystems. The plan's scope is comprehensive and includes various ecosystems, both terrestrial and marine.


**7. With reference to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EUDR, aimed at preventing deforestation and forest degradation globally, applies to a wide range of products, including palm oil, soy, beef, cocoa, and timber, requiring companies to verify the origin of these products and imposing strict penalties for non-compliance.
2.  The EUDR's implementation has been universally praised by all exporting countries as a fair and effective mechanism for combating deforestation, leading to significant reductions in deforestation rates globally within a short time frame.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The EUDR's aim to prevent deforestation and forest degradation is accurate, as is its broad application to various product categories. The requirement for origin verification and penalties for non-compliance are also key features of the regulation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The EUDR's implementation has been met with mixed reactions from exporting countries.  While some have embraced the regulation as a way to promote sustainable practices, others have criticized it as a barrier to trade and raised concerns about its potential impact on their economies.  Furthermore, it is far too early to definitively claim significant global reductions in deforestation rates due to this regulation's implementation.  The statement presents an overly optimistic and unsubstantiated claim.


**8. With reference to the "Natural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services (NCAVES)" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  NCAVES, launched by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), UNEP, and the Secretariat of the CBD in 2017, aims to integrate natural capital accounting into national statistical systems, providing a comprehensive framework for measuring and valuing ecosystem services.
2.  India's participation in NCAVES has led to the immediate and complete integration of natural capital accounting into all national statistical systems, resulting in the accurate and comprehensive valuation of all ecosystem services within the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NCAVES' aims to integrate natural capital accounting into national statistical systems and provide a framework for measuring and valuing ecosystem services are accurate reflections of its objectives.  The statement correctly identifies the launching organizations and the year of launch.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India participates in NCAVES, claiming that this participation has led to the *immediate and complete* integration of natural capital accounting into *all* national statistical systems is an overstatement.  The integration of such complex accounting frameworks is a gradual process, and it is unlikely that complete and accurate valuation of all ecosystem services has been achieved within a short time frame. The statement makes an unsubstantiated claim about the speed and comprehensiveness of implementation in India.


**9. With reference to the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Uttarakhand, the first Indian state to launch a GEPI, uses a novel method to evaluate ecological development, focusing on four pillars: air, soil, water, and forests, and providing a comprehensive measure of the state's overall environmental health.
2.  The GEPI formula,  `(Air-GEP index + Water-GEP index + Soil-GEP index + Forest-GEP index)`, accurately quantifies the economic contributions of natural ecosystems, providing a direct measure of their value in monetary terms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Uttarakhand's pioneering use of the GEPI to assess ecological development, focusing on the four pillars mentioned, is accurate.  The index aims to provide a holistic view of environmental health, although it is important to note that  "comprehensive measure of the state's overall environmental health" is a subjective interpretation and can vary in perspective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the formula presented is a simplified representation of the GEPI calculation, it is inaccurate to claim that it directly quantifies the economic contributions of natural ecosystems in *monetary terms*. The GEPI is an index, not a direct monetary valuation.  The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between environmental health and economic value and misrepresents the nature of the GEPI's output.  The index provides a relative measure, not a precise monetary valuation.


**10. With reference to the Just Energy Transition, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definition of a Just Energy Transition accurately reflects the core principles of equity, inclusivity, and the creation of decent work opportunities while transitioning to cleaner energy sources.  The statement correctly references the COP26 declaration.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's commitment to a Just Energy Transition is a complex and nuanced policy goal.  It is inaccurate to state that India plans to phase out *all* fossil fuel-based energy sources *immediately* or to completely shift to renewable energy within a decade.  Such a rapid transition would be unrealistic and potentially disruptive.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and unrealistic portrayal of India's energy transition plans.  The transition will be a gradual process involving various strategies and timelines.


**1. With reference to Megafauna, consider the following statements:**

1. Megafauna are defined as animals weighing above 50 kg, categorized into megaherbivores, megacarnivores, and megaomnivores based on their diet.
2.  The Late Pleistocene witnessed significant anthropogenic pressures leading to dramatic losses, primarily among megaherbivores and megacarnivores, with extinct species including woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect characteristics of megafauna. Statement 1 correctly defines megafauna based on weight and dietary classifications.  The weight threshold of 50 kg is a commonly used, though not universally accepted, benchmark. The categorization into herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores is a standard ecological classification system applicable to megafauna.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the Late Pleistocene epoch as a period of significant megafauna decline due to human activities (anthropogenic pressures). The extinction of iconic species like woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers is well-documented evidence of this decline, particularly impacting megaherbivores and megacarnivores.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.  The information presented is factual and widely accepted within the field of paleontology and ecology.


**2. With reference to Stromatolites, consider the following statements:**

1. Stromatolites are microbial communities forming layered rock structures, primarily contributing to the Great Oxidation Event by releasing significant amounts of oxygen into the early Earth's atmosphere.
2.  Modern stromatolites are commonly found in shallow marine environments worldwide, reflecting their adaptability to diverse conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Stromatolites are indeed layered microbial structures, and their activity played a significant role in the Great Oxidation Event, although the extent of their contribution is still a subject of scientific debate.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect.  Modern stromatolites are *not* commonly found in shallow marine environments worldwide.  They are, in fact, relatively rare and typically found in extreme environments with limited competition from other organisms, like hypersaline lakes or high-energy intertidal zones. The recent discovery of living shallow-marine stromatolites near the Red Sea highlights their rarity, rather than their commonality.  Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct, making (a) the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the distribution and prevalence of modern stromatolites.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS):**

1.  UNCLOS, adopted in 1982 and enforced in 1994, enjoys near-universal acceptance, with over 170 state parties, including India, signifying its broad international recognition and legal standing.
2.  UNCLOS primarily focuses on regulating fishing rights and resource extraction within national Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), establishing quotas and fishing regulations to ensure sustainable practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes UNCLOS's adoption, enforcement, and widespread acceptance.  The near-universal participation of nations, including India, underscores its significance as a cornerstone of international maritime law. Statement 2, however, presents a significantly narrowed and inaccurate view of UNCLOS's scope. While UNCLOS does address resource management within EEZs, its scope is far broader, encompassing a wide range of issues including navigation rights, marine scientific research, protection of the marine environment, seabed mining regulations, and the delimitation of maritime boundaries.  It establishes the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a point not mentioned in statement 2, which regulates activities in the international seabed area. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) misinterpret the comprehensive nature of UNCLOS.


**4. With reference to Coral Bleaching, consider the following statements:**

1. Coral bleaching, caused by the expulsion of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) due to environmental stress (e.g., increased temperature, pollution), primarily affects hard corals responsible for reef building.
2.  India's coral reefs, particularly in the Lakshadweep Islands and the Gulf of Mannar, have shown resilience to coral bleaching events, exhibiting minimal impact from recent occurrences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the process of coral bleaching.  The expulsion of zooxanthellae, crucial for coral nutrition and color, is the defining characteristic of bleaching, and it primarily affects hard corals that form the structure of coral reefs. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Recent reports indicate significant coral bleaching events impacting India's coral reefs in areas like Lakshadweep, the Gulf of Mannar, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands, demonstrating considerable vulnerability and damage.  The statement misrepresents the actual observed impact. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the current state of coral health in Indian waters.


**5. With reference to the "Grasshopper Effect," consider the following statements:**

1. The "Grasshopper Effect" describes the long-range atmospheric transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and other chemicals from lower latitudes to the Arctic region, accumulating in polar environments.
2.  The accumulation of pollutants via the "Grasshopper Effect" primarily affects wildlife populations in the Arctic, with minimal impact on human health and indigenous communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the "Grasshopper Effect" as a process of long-range atmospheric transport of persistent pollutants towards the poles.  The term "global distillation" is often used synonymously, highlighting the concentration of these chemicals in high-latitude regions. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The accumulation of pollutants through this effect poses significant threats to both human health and the well-being of Arctic indigenous communities.  Exposure to these chemicals is linked to various health problems, including cancer, heart disease, and developmental issues.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the significant human health implications of the "Grasshopper Effect" in the Arctic.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD):**

1. AD, a decline in oxygen levels in oceanic and coastal waters, is primarily driven by increased ocean temperatures due to climate change, reducing oxygen solubility in water.
2.  AD's impact is limited to deep-sea ecosystems, causing minimal disruption to shallow-water marine habitats and biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Chipko movement, famously known for its non-violent resistance against deforestation, primarily involved women from the Reni village in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district. While the movement gained significant momentum in the 1970s,  pinpointing the exact commencement date is difficult, and various sources might offer slightly differing years.  However, the essence of the statement—the involvement of women from Reni and the non-violent resistance against deforestation—remains accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Bishnoi community's history of protecting trees and wildlife dates back centuries. Amrita Devi's sacrifice in the 18th century to prevent tree felling is a pivotal event highlighting the community's commitment to environmental protection. This historical precedent significantly contributed to the philosophy and approach of the later Chipko movement.  The royal decree issued following Amrita Devi's act is a key example of successful community-based conservation.


**2. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) primarily focuses on quantifying ecosystem services provided by natural resources like forests and rivers, while SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) measures the economic value of individual resources.
2. EnviStats India 2024, compiled using the SEEA framework, highlighted a significant increase in the area under total protected areas in India between 2000 and 2023, demonstrating progress in biodiversity conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA have their roles reversed in the description. The SEEA-CF focuses on measuring environmental assets and individual resources and how the economy uses them (e.g., timber, water, fish).  SEEA-EA, on the other hand, measures ecosystems and the services they provide to economic and human activity (e.g., forests, rivers, coral reefs).  The statement incorrectly swaps these functions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The EnviStats India 2024 report, based on the SEEA framework, did indeed highlight a substantial increase in both the number and area of Total Protected Areas in India between 2000 and 2023. This finding accurately reflects progress in India's efforts toward biodiversity conservation and aligns with the broader goals of environmental accounting.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and related reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDG India Index 2023-24, released by NITI Aayog, revealed that all states and union territories in India showed improvement in their overall scores, with Uttarakhand and Kerala ranking highest among the states.
2. The Sustainable Development Report 2024, published by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), indicated that globally, only a small percentage of SDG targets were on track to be met by 2030, with India performing better than the global average.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SDG India Index 2023-24 report from NITI Aayog did indeed show improvements across all states and union territories.  Uttarakhand and Kerala were highlighted as top performers among the states.  This reflects positive trends in India's progress towards achieving the SDGs, although it doesn't imply complete achievement of all targets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sustainable Development Report 2024 did highlight the low percentage of globally on-track SDG targets, the statement misrepresents India's performance relative to the global average. The report placed India at 109th out of 166 countries, indicating that its performance is below the global average, not above it.  The report specifically noted decreasing progress in certain areas for India, contrasting with the claim of better-than-average performance.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning environmental organizations and initiatives in India:**

1. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body established under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, operating under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change and responsible for implementing air and water pollution control legislations across the country.
2.  The National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) Authority funded the Bustard Recovery Project, implemented by the Wildlife Institute of India, focusing on the conservation of the Lesser Florican, among other bustard species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is indeed a statutory body and works under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change. However, it was established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, not the Air Act of 1981.  While it does have powers and functions under the Air Act, its establishment predates the Air Act.  This detail makes the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The information accurately describes the Bustard Recovery Project, its funding source (CAMPA), implementing agency (Wildlife Institute of India), and the focus on Lesser Florican conservation.  The project's collaborative nature and objectives are also detailed correctly in the source material.

1. The NRP aims to restore at least 50% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2050, encompassing all ecosystems needing restoration.
2.  The NRP’s implementation is solely dependent on the European Commission's direct actions, bypassing national-level involvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRP aims to recover *at least 20%* of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030, and *all* ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050.  The figure of 50% is a misrepresentation of the plan's ambitious, yet more realistically scaled targets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRP's implementation is achieved through National Restoration Plans developed and executed by individual EU countries.  The European Commission provides the overarching framework and targets, but the practical implementation relies heavily on the participation and action of each member state. This decentralized approach ensures the plan's relevance and effectiveness across diverse European ecosystems.


**3. With reference to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The EUDR applies exclusively to products originating within the European Union, aiming to curb deforestation within its borders.
2. The EUDR mandates companies to provide detailed traceability information for covered products, verifying their origin and production processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EUDR's scope extends beyond the EU's borders.  Its aim is to prevent deforestation and forest degradation *globally*, ensuring that products placed on the EU market do not contribute to such activities, regardless of their origin.  This is a crucial element of the regulation, addressing the global impact of EU consumption patterns.

Statement 2 is correct. A core element of the EUDR is the requirement for companies to verify and document the origin of covered products, including detailed traceability information. This due diligence process helps ensure that the products are not linked to deforestation or forest degradation.  This traceability requirement acts as a powerful incentive for sustainable sourcing practices within the supply chains of various commodities.


**4. With reference to the Western Ghats Eco-sensitive Zone (ESZ), consider the following statements:**

1. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG), headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, recommended the complete ban of all industrial activities within the Western Ghats ESZ.
2. The 6th iteration of the draft notification for the Western Ghats ESZ declares approximately 56,825.7 sq km as an ecologically sensitive area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The HLWG's recommendations were more nuanced than a complete ban on all industrial activities. While it proposed stricter regulations and color-coding of industries based on their environmental impact, it didn't advocate for a complete ban.  The recommendations aimed to balance environmental protection with economic development within a carefully managed framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The 6th iteration of the draft notification for the Western Ghats ESZ indeed proposed declaring approximately 56,825.7 sq km as an ecologically sensitive area. This reflects the significant ecological importance of the Western Ghats and the need for robust protective measures.  The ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding the notification highlight the complexities of balancing conservation with other development priorities.

1. NDCs are legally binding commitments under the Paris Agreement, requiring countries to achieve specific emission reduction targets.
2. India's NDCs at COP29 included a proposal for a new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG) of $1.3 trillion annually, with a significant portion comprising grants or equivalent resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) are crucial under the Paris Agreement, they are not legally binding in the sense of imposing strict penalties for non-compliance.  They represent each country's commitment to climate action, reflecting national circumstances and capabilities.  The framework encourages ambition and transparency, but it doesn't involve legally enforceable penalties.

Statement 2 is correct.  At COP29, India did propose a new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG) of $1.3 trillion annually, emphasizing the need for a significant portion to come from grants or equivalent resources to support developing countries' climate action. This reflects India's stance on equitable burden-sharing in addressing global climate change.


**12. With reference to the outcomes of COP29, consider the following statements:**

1. COP29 finalized the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which pertains to international carbon markets.
2. The Baku Declaration on Global Climate Transparency, launched at COP29, focuses solely on enhancing transparency in mitigation efforts, excluding adaptation measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant achievement of COP29 was the finalization of the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which governs international carbon markets. This long-awaited agreement provides a framework for countries to cooperate on emissions reduction through market mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Baku Declaration on Global Climate Transparency has a broader scope than just mitigation. It aims to enhance transparency across various aspects of climate action, including both mitigation and adaptation efforts, recognizing the importance of transparency in achieving the overall goals of the Paris Agreement.  The declaration supports the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF).


**13. With reference to the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) report, ‘Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2024’, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI report indicates that climate finance flows surpassed USD 2 trillion in 2023, driven primarily by increased investments in renewable energy and low-carbon transport.
2. The report highlights a consistent decline in fossil fuel investments and consumer fossil fuel subsidies since 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPI report stated that climate finance flows likely surpassed USD 1.5 trillion in 2023, a significant figure, but not USD 2 trillion.  While renewable energy and low-carbon transport did see increased investment, the report provided a more nuanced picture of the overall climate finance landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report actually found that fossil fuel investment and consumer fossil fuel subsidies *continued to increase* annually since 2020, despite the growth in renewable energy investment.  This highlights the continuing challenge of transitioning away from fossil fuels and the need for stronger policy interventions.


**14. With reference to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), consider the following statements:**

1. SBTi is a UN-backed organization that sets standards and provides guidance for companies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
2.  Concerns have been raised regarding SBTi's decision to allow companies to offset greenhouse gas emissions from their value chain.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) is not a UN-backed organization.  It's an independent organization that works with companies and financial institutions to set science-based emission reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement's goals.  While it aims to help companies achieve significant emission reductions, it doesn't mandate net-zero by 2050 as a universal requirement.

Statement 2 is correct.  Concerns have indeed been raised regarding SBTi's decision to allow companies to offset some of their greenhouse gas emissions from their value chain.  Critics argue that this could weaken the overall impact of science-based targets and potentially allow companies to avoid making necessary emission reductions.  The debate highlights the complexities of achieving meaningful emissions reductions through corporate climate action.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NICES (National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies) Programme is operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Department of Space, in collaboration with other ministries under the framework of the National Action Plan on Climate Change.  While it supports the Ministry's objectives, it's not solely an initiative of that ministry.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NICES Programme leverages satellite-based remote sensing technologies extensively for data collection and analysis related to climate and environmental studies.  This reliance on space technology enables large-scale monitoring and assessment of environmental parameters across India.  This utilization of advanced technology is a key feature of the NICES Programme.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The UN-REDD report highlights that only a small fraction of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have included quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2.  The UN-REDD report indicates that a majority of NDCs prioritize afforestation and reforestation initiatives over addressing deforestation, despite the latter being crucial for climate change mitigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN-REDD report explicitly states that only 8 out of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have quantified forest targets in their NDCs.  This highlights a significant gap in global efforts to combat deforestation, a major contributor to climate change. The report emphasizes the need for stronger commitments and more ambitious targets from these high-deforestation countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UN-REDD report does mention that 11 NDCs contain quantified targets for afforestation and reforestation, it does *not* state that these initiatives are prioritized *over* addressing deforestation.  In fact, the report strongly emphasizes that reducing deforestation is a prerequisite for effective climate change mitigation through forestry.  Afforestation and reforestation are important supplementary measures but cannot compensate for the loss of existing forests.  The report advocates for a holistic approach that tackles both deforestation and promotes forest restoration.  The misrepresentation of the report's findings in statement 2 makes it incorrect.


**2. With reference to Camelids, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kharai camel, found in Kutch, Gujarat, is known for its ability to swim long distances in the sea to graze on mangroves, covering distances up to 5 km at a time.
2.  Bactrian camels, characterized by two humps, are exclusively found in the Nubra Valley of Ladakh and nowhere else in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kharai camels in Kutch, Gujarat, are indeed known for their unique ability to swim in the sea to feed on mangroves, the distance they cover is stated as 3 km, not 5 km.  This minor factual inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect in the context of a precise factual recall question.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although Bactrian camels are found in Ladakh's Nubra Valley, the statement that they are found *exclusively* there in India is an overstatement.  The information provided only mentions their presence in Nubra Valley.  It doesn't rule out the possibility of small, isolated populations elsewhere in India, though this is unlikely.  The absolute and exclusive nature of the claim makes it factually incorrect.  A more accurate statement would specify the known location without making an absolute claim about their distribution within India.


**3. With reference to the National Coastal Mission Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Coastal Mission Programme focuses solely on mangrove conservation and excludes coral reef conservation from its mandate.
2. The Magical Mangroves campaign, while supporting mangrove conservation, is entirely independent of the National Coastal Mission Programme and operates without any collaboration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that the National Coastal Mission Programme addresses both "Conservation and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs."  The statement wrongly restricts the programme's scope to only mangroves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions the Magical Mangroves campaign as a separate initiative by WWF India, it doesn't state that it operates independently of the National Coastal Mission Programme.  It's plausible that there could be synergies or indirect links between the two, even if not explicitly stated as a direct collaboration.  The claim of complete independence is therefore an unsupported assertion and makes the statement incorrect.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) receives environmental compensation solely based on the Polluter Pays Principle, as mandated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
2.  The Environment Protection Charge (EPC) levied on new diesel vehicles in Delhi and NCR is directly deposited into the CPCB's general funds and is not subject to any specific allocation or utilization guidelines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPCB does receive environmental compensation based on the Polluter Pays Principle, the statement incorrectly limits the source to only NGT orders.  The text mentions that the CPCB also receives compensation through Supreme Court orders.  This makes the statement's assertion incomplete and thus incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that the EPC is a source of funds for the CPCB, but it does not specify that there are *no* guidelines for its allocation or utilization.  The fact that 80% of environmental funds remained unutilized suggests the existence of some sort of allocation process and possible constraints.  The statement's claim of complete lack of guidelines is therefore an unsupported assumption and renders the statement incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FAC's primary function is to approve the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, with its recommendations being legally binding on all government agencies.
2.  The FAC recently issued a blanket ban on all surveys involving drilling and felling of trees in forest areas, regardless of the scale or purpose of the developmental project.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the FAC's role is "recommendatory in nature" regarding the diversion of forest land. Its recommendations are not legally binding.  The statement misrepresents the FAC's authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the FAC *exempted* surveys involving the felling of up to 100 trees for certain developmental projects.  This directly contradicts the claim of a blanket ban.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual FAC decision.


**6. With reference to the Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Atlas reveals a consistent decline in both Kharif and Rabi cropland areas over the past 17 years, indicating a shrinking agricultural footprint.
2.  The Atlas shows a significant increase in built-up land area since 2005, exceeding a 40% growth rate.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Atlas shows an *expansion*, not a decline, in Kharif and Rabi cropland areas over the past 17 years. The statement presents the opposite trend.

2. GEPI's four pillars—air, soil, water, and forest—are assessed using a weighted average formula, giving equal importance to each pillar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GEPI does measure the ecological development caused by human interventions, it does not cover *all* human activities.  The focus is primarily on the impact on natural ecosystems, not the full scope of human activity.  The statement overstates the index's coverage.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While GEPI does use a formula to combine assessments across four pillars, these pillars are not given equal weight. The weighting methodology used is not specified as equal importance to each pillar. The statement provides an inaccurate representation of the index's calculation methodology.



**1. With reference to the impact of warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on cyclones in Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. Cyclones in Southeast Asia now form further away from the coasts due to increased ocean currents driven by warmer SSTs.
2. Warmer SSTs lead to a faster intensification of cyclones, resulting in shorter lifespan over land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Warmer SSTs actually contribute to cyclones forming *closer* to coasts in Southeast Asia, not further away. The increased energy available from warmer waters fuels faster development and intensification, often leading to landfall before the cyclone has fully matured in the open ocean.  Increased ocean currents are a factor in cyclone formation but not the primary reason for proximity to coastlines in this context. The statement incorrectly reverses the observed effect.

Statement 2 is correct.  Warmer SSTs provide more energy to cyclones, leading to more rapid intensification. However, this doesn't necessarily mean a *shorter* lifespan over land. While a more intense cyclone might dissipate faster due to the loss of its energy source (warm water), the increased intensity can also lead to prolonged effects on land even after landfall. The statement is partially correct in that intensification is faster but misleads on the lifecycle impact.  The duration of impact on land is complex and depends on multiple factors beyond just intensification.


**2. With reference to the IMD's colour-coded weather warnings for cyclone-prone areas, consider the following statements:**

1. A "Yellow" alert indicates a pre-cyclone watch, issued 72 hours in advance.

2.  Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh are among the regions with the most significant expansion of glacial lakes, increasing the risk of GLOFs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC report showed a 33.7% increase in the area of glacial lakes in India between 2011 and 2024, not 40%.  While a significant increase, the statement exaggerates the actual figure reported by the CWC. This is a crucial detail, as even a small difference can significantly alter the perception of the risk.

Statement 2 is correct. The mentioned states are indeed among those with the most notable expansion of glacial lakes, making them highly vulnerable to GLOFs. The statement accurately identifies the regions at high risk, highlighting the geographical distribution of this environmental hazard.


**4. With reference to Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD) and Planetary Boundaries, consider the following statements:**

1.  AD is primarily caused by the increased solubility of oxygen in warmer waters, leading to a decline in oxygen levels in both oceanic and coastal waters.
2. Eutrophication, driven by nutrient over-enrichment from anthropogenic sources, contributes to AD by stimulating algal blooms that consume large amounts of oxygen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Warmer waters actually *decrease* the solubility of oxygen, meaning less oxygen can dissolve in the water. This is a key factor contributing to AD. The statement incorrectly describes the relationship between temperature and oxygen solubility.

Statement 2 is correct. Eutrophication, the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients, leads to algal blooms. These blooms consume large quantities of oxygen during their growth and decomposition, creating hypoxic or anoxic conditions (low or no oxygen) in the water. This is a significant driver of AD. The statement correctly explains one of the primary mechanisms behind AD.


**5. With reference to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, consider the following statements:**

1. A Category 5 super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale has wind speeds ranging from 119-153 km/hr.
2. The Saffir-Simpson scale classifies tropical cyclones into five categories based solely on wind speed, ignoring other factors like storm surge and rainfall.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Category 5 super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale has wind speeds of 252 km/hr or higher. The statement misrepresents the wind speed range for the most destructive category.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While wind speed is the primary factor used to categorize hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson scale, it does not solely rely on wind speed.  The scale indirectly accounts for potential storm surge and rainfall damage based on wind speed correlation, but these factors are not directly measured or explicitly incorporated into the category classification.  The statement incorrectly suggests a singular focus on wind speed. The scale is a simplified system for assessing potential damage, and other factors influence the actual destructive effects.



**1. With reference to Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs), consider the following statements:**

1.  GLOFs primarily occur in the Himalayan region due to the presence of numerous glacial lakes formed by melting glaciers, and their vulnerability increases with the expansion of these lakes' surface areas.
2.  The geological factors contributing to GLOFs include earthquakes, breaches in moraine dams, and excessive precipitation, while morphological factors involve mass movements into glacial lakes and water seepage through glacial structures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Himalayan region is highly susceptible to GLOFs due to the abundance of glacial lakes.  The melting of glaciers, exacerbated by climate change, leads to the formation and expansion of these lakes.  Increased surface area directly correlates with a higher risk of catastrophic outburst floods.  Reports from organizations like the Central Water Commission (CWC) highlight the significant expansion of glacial lakes and the consequent increase in GLOF risk.

Statement 2 is also correct.  GLOFs are complex events with multiple contributing factors. Geological factors such as earthquakes can trigger dam failures, while breaches in moraine dams (natural dams formed by glacial debris) are a common cause. Excessive precipitation can overwhelm the capacity of these dams, leading to an outburst. Morphological factors, such as mass movements of rock and debris into the lakes, can destabilize them and trigger a flood. Water seepage through the glacial structures weakens the dams, further increasing vulnerability.


**2. With reference to the Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD) and Planetary Boundaries, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aquatic deoxygenation is characterized by a decrease in oxygen levels in both oceanic and coastal waters, primarily driven by global warming and increased nutrient enrichment from anthropogenic sources.
2.  The transgression of the planetary boundary related to aquatic deoxygenation has significant impacts on marine ecosystems, including the formation of dead zones, habitat compression, and alterations in the marine food web.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Aquatic deoxygenation (AD) refers to the decline in dissolved oxygen in aquatic systems.  Global warming, a key driver of AD, reduces oxygen solubility in water.  Furthermore, increased nutrient runoff (eutrophication) from agricultural activities and other human sources fuels algal blooms. These blooms consume significant amounts of oxygen when they decompose, creating hypoxic (low-oxygen) or anoxic (oxygen-depleted) zones.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The impacts of AD on marine ecosystems are severe and far-reaching.  Dead zones, areas with extremely low oxygen levels, become uninhabitable for most marine life.  Habitat compression occurs as species are forced to migrate to areas with sufficient oxygen, leading to increased competition and potential population declines.  The disruption of the marine food web has cascading effects throughout the ecosystem.  Experts are increasingly calling for the recognition of AD as a new planetary boundary, highlighting its critical importance in maintaining a healthy planet.


**3. With reference to the Central Water Commission (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Water Commission is responsible for the integrated and sustainable development and management of both surface and groundwater resources in India.
2. The CWC's mandate includes promoting integrated water resource management and undertaking studies related to flood control, irrigation, and hydropower development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC plays a crucial role in the integrated and sustainable development and management of water resources in India, its focus is primarily on *surface* water resources.  The management of groundwater resources falls under the purview of the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB).  The distinction between surface and groundwater management is a key aspect of India's water resource policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The CWC's core functions include promoting integrated water resource management, conducting investigations and studies related to flood control, irrigation projects, and hydropower development.  It plays a vital role in providing technical guidance and support to various stakeholders in the water sector.  Its assessments and recommendations influence policy decisions related to water resource utilization and management in India.


**4. With reference to the impacts of climate change on cyclones in Southeast Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) contribute to more frequent and intense cyclones, with a trend towards cyclones forming closer to coasts, intensifying rapidly, and lingering longer over land.
2.  The increased frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea, compared to the Bay of Bengal, is primarily attributed to unusual monsoon wind systems and increased moisture from the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) provide the energy that fuels tropical cyclones.  Higher SSTs lead to more intense cyclones, increased rainfall, and stronger winds.  The trend of cyclones forming closer to coasts is also linked to warmer SSTs, potentially due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns.  The longer duration of cyclones over land is a consequence of several factors, including warmer land temperatures and altered atmospheric conditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Arabian Sea is experiencing an increase in cyclone frequency, it is not *primarily* due to the factors mentioned. The Bay of Bengal historically has a higher frequency of cyclones compared to the Arabian Sea.  The reasons behind the increased cyclone activity in the Arabian Sea are complex and still under research, with factors such as changes in ocean currents, atmospheric conditions, and monsoon patterns playing a role.  Attributing it solely to unusual monsoon wind systems and increased moisture is an oversimplification.


**5. With reference to the  International Year of Camelids (2024), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN declared 2024 as the International Year of Camelids to highlight the cultural significance of camels and their role in various traditional practices across different regions.
2.  Camelids, found in both Africa and Asia, are characterized by their adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments, and different species exhibit variations in hump number and physical characteristics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The United Nations declared 2024 as the International Year of Camelids to raise global awareness about the importance of camelids.  While their economic contributions are significant (e.g., milk, meat, wool, transportation), the declaration also acknowledges the cultural and traditional significance of camels in many societies.  The initiative aims to promote sustainable practices related to camelid farming and conservation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Camelids are indeed found in both Africa and Asia.  The two most well-known species are the Dromedary camel (one hump) and the Bactrian camel (two humps).  Variations exist within species, and their remarkable adaptations allow them to thrive in harsh, water-scarce environments.  Their ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and survive on limited water resources is a testament to their evolutionary success.  Other camelids, such as llamas and alpacas, are found in South America.


**1. With reference to the characteristics of Tropical Cyclones and Tornadoes, consider the following statements:**

1. Tropical cyclones require very low values of tropospheric vertical wind shear for their formation, while tornadoes require substantial vertical shear of horizontal winds.
2. Tropical cyclones are purely an oceanic phenomenon, whereas tornadoes primarily develop over land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tropical cyclones need minimal vertical wind shear to maintain their organized structure.  Strong wind shear disrupts the upward flow of warm, moist air, which is crucial for the cyclone's energy source (condensation). In contrast, tornadoes, which are smaller and more intense, thrive in environments with significant vertical wind shear. This shear contributes to the rotation and intensification of the tornado.

Statement 2 is also correct. Tropical cyclones derive their energy from the warm ocean surface and require a large body of warm water to sustain themselves. They weaken significantly or dissipate upon landfall due to the loss of their moisture source. Tornadoes, on the other hand, are associated with thunderstorms, which can form over land. While some tornadoes might form near coastlines, their formation is not inherently linked to the ocean in the same way that tropical cyclones are.  The presence of contrasting air masses over land is the key factor in their development.  Therefore, the fundamental difference in their formation locations makes statement 2 accurate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale:**

1. The scale classifies tropical cyclones into five categories based on their sustained wind speeds, with Category 5 representing the strongest and most destructive storms, having wind speeds exceeding 252 km/hr.
2. The scale is primarily used for hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and does not apply to cyclones in other ocean basins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1-5 scale categorizing hurricanes based on their sustained wind speed.  Category 5 represents the most powerful hurricanes, with wind speeds of 252 km/hr or higher. While the name "Hurricane" is specific to the Atlantic, the underlying principles of the scale (wind speed-based classification of intense tropical cyclones) are applicable to similar storms in other ocean basins, such as typhoons and cyclones.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the scale was initially developed for hurricanes in the Atlantic, the principles behind it are universally applicable to intense tropical cyclones worldwide.  The categorization of cyclones, typhoons, and other similar weather systems based on sustained wind speed is a fundamental aspect of tropical cyclone meteorology, regardless of geographical location or specific naming conventions.  The scale provides a standardized framework for understanding and communicating the intensity of these storms, regardless of where they occur.


**3. With reference to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), consider the following statements:**

1.  GLOFs are sudden releases of water retained in glacial lakes, primarily caused by geological factors such as earthquakes and the breaching of moraine dams.
2.  In India, the states most vulnerable to GLOFs are exclusively located in the Himalayas, with no risk to other regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While geological factors like earthquakes and moraine dam breaches are significant causes of GLOFs, it's crucial to acknowledge that other factors also contribute.  Morphological factors (mass movements into lakes, seepage), physical factors (excessive precipitation, cryoseisms), and glacial surging also play a role in triggering these floods.  However, the statement accurately captures the primary geological triggers that are often the most devastating.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Himalayan states are indeed highly vulnerable to GLOFs due to the presence of numerous glacial lakes,  the risk is not exclusively confined to those regions.  The factors contributing to GLOFs (glacial melting, unstable moraine dams, etc.) could theoretically exist in other mountainous regions with similar geological features, even if the frequency and magnitude of such events might be lower.  Therefore, limiting the vulnerability to only the Himalayas is an oversimplification.


**4. With reference to the Central Water Commission (CWC) and its role in GLOF management, consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, is responsible for managing both surface water and groundwater resources in India.
2.  A recent CWC report showed a significant increase in the surface area of glacial lakes in India, particularly identifying 67 lakes at high risk for GLOFs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CWC focuses solely on surface water resources.  Groundwater management is the responsibility of the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB), a separate organization.  The division of responsibilities reflects the distinct hydrological characteristics and management challenges of surface and groundwater systems.

Statement 2 is correct.  A recent CWC report did indeed highlight a substantial increase in the area of glacial lakes in India, identifying a significant number of lakes at high risk of GLOFs. This finding underscores the growing threat posed by these lakes and the need for proactive risk mitigation strategies. The report's findings have prompted increased focus on monitoring and managing these potentially hazardous water bodies.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of global warming on cyclone formation:**

1. Global warming is leading to stronger tropical cyclones, with those in Southeast Asia showing a tendency to form closer to coasts, intensify more rapidly, and linger longer over land.
2. The increased frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea compared to the Bay of Bengal is a direct and solely attributable consequence of global warming.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant body of scientific evidence suggests that global warming is intensifying tropical cyclones.  Warmer sea surface temperatures provide more energy to these storms, leading to stronger winds and heavier rainfall.  The observed changes in cyclone behavior in Southeast Asia, such as closer coastal formation, rapid intensification, and prolonged landfall durations, are consistent with the predicted effects of global warming.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While global warming is influencing cyclone patterns, attributing the increased frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea solely to global warming is an oversimplification.  Other factors, such as changes in monsoon wind systems, increased moisture from the Arabian Sea, soil moisture from land, and variations in ocean currents, also contribute to the observed changes.  Therefore,  ascribing the shift solely to global warming is inaccurate.  The interaction of multiple factors makes it impossible to isolate global warming as the single cause.



**6. With reference to India's localized weather forecasting capabilities, consider the following statements:**

1. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) currently possesses the ability to forecast weather events with high accuracy over a 12km x 12km area.
2. The IMD's ongoing efforts aim to improve forecasting accuracy to the level of 1km x 1km grids through hyper-local forecasting.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The IMD has made significant advancements in its weather forecasting capabilities, achieving a relatively high degree of accuracy in predicting weather events over a 12km x 12km area. This represents a considerable improvement in accuracy over previous decades.

Statement 2 is also correct. The IMD is actively pursuing the development of hyper-local forecasting, aiming to enhance the accuracy and detail of weather predictions to much smaller geographical areas (1km x 1km grids). This ambitious goal would significantly improve the precision of weather forecasts and enable more effective disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts.  The development of hyper-local models requires advanced technology and extensive data collection.


**7. With reference to the "Kallakkadal" phenomenon, consider the following statements:**

1. Kallakkadal is a type of coastal flooding caused by swell waves, typically occurring during the pre-monsoon or post-monsoon seasons along the southwest coast of India.
2. Swell waves responsible for Kallakkadal are generated solely by local winds and are always parallel to the wind direction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kallakkadal accurately describes coastal flooding along India's southwest coast, primarily caused by swell waves that arrive during the pre- or post-monsoon seasons.  These waves are distinct from locally generated waves and often travel long distances from distant weather systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Swell waves are not generated solely by local winds.  They are generated by distant storms (e.g., hurricanes) and can travel thousands of kilometers across oceans, reaching coastal areas far removed from their origin.  Importantly, swell waves propagate in directions that can differ from the wind direction at the location of the flooding. The direction of swell wave propagation is determined by the location and direction of the generating storm, not solely by local wind patterns.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Heat Budget of the Earth:**

1. The Earth's heat budget refers to the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation, with disturbances primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions.
2.  The PREFIRE mission launched by NASA exclusively focuses on measuring heat radiation from the Arctic and Antarctic regions to understand their contribution to global warming.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Earth's heat budget is a fundamental concept in climate science, representing the equilibrium between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation (heat radiated back into space).  Disruptions to this balance, leading to warming or cooling, are primarily caused by factors such as changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, alterations in atmospheric composition (e.g., ozone depletion), and changes in surface reflectivity (albedo).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PREFIRE mission does involve measuring heat radiation from the Arctic and Antarctic, it is not exclusively focused on these regions. The broader goal is to improve understanding of the Earth's overall energy balance and the role of polar regions in this balance.  The mission aims to enhance the accuracy of climate models by providing more precise data on the polar regions' radiative properties but isn't limited to only these regions for its observations.



**9. With reference to the Nor'westers, consider the following statements:**

1. Nor'westers are local winds causing thunderstorms, primarily affecting the eastern and northeastern regions of India during the summer months.
2.  The influence of Nor'westers is uniformly positive, benefiting agricultural productivity without any negative impacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nor'westers are indeed local winds that produce intense thunderstorms, primarily impacting eastern and northeastern India during the summer season.  They are characterized by their sudden onset and powerful winds, bringing both benefits and challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nor'westers can be beneficial for pre-kharif crops, their impact is not uniformly positive.  They are also capable of causing destructive tornadoes, uprooting trees, and damaging property.  The intense winds and heavy rainfall associated with Nor'westers can lead to significant negative consequences, highlighting the dual nature of their impact.  The statement's claim of uniformly positive influence is therefore untrue.


**10. With reference to the  Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), consider the following statements:**

1.  DEWS data indicated that approximately 30% of India's land area experienced varying degrees of drought in September 2023.
2.  According to DEWS, August 2023 was the wettest August since 1901, marking an exceptionally high rainfall month.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. DEWS data did indeed show that a substantial portion (approximately 30%) of India's land area was affected by drought conditions of varying severity in September 2023. This highlights the vulnerability of certain regions to water scarcity and the importance of drought monitoring systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The DEWS data actually indicated that August 2023 was the *driest* August since 1901.  This unusually low rainfall contributed to the drought conditions observed later in the year.  The statement's assertion of exceptionally high rainfall is the opposite of the actual finding.  The contrast between the statement and the actual DEWS data makes it clearly incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FWI Report's core function is to monitor and quantify food waste across different stages of the food supply chain.  It specifically focuses on quantifying waste at the retail and consumer levels (households and food service), providing valuable data for understanding the scale of food waste and informing interventions to reduce it.


**7.  With reference to the Paira cropping system, consider the following statements:**

1. Paira cropping is a method of intercropping where multiple crops are sown simultaneously.
2. Paira cropping involves sowing short-duration pulses or oilseeds in a standing rice crop.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Paira cropping involves multiple crops, it's not a simultaneous sowing of diverse crops.  It's a relay cropping system where a short-duration crop is sown *after* the primary crop (rice) has already been established.  This specific timing is crucial to the system's efficiency.

Statement 2 is correct. The Paira cropping system is a highly efficient technique employed in certain regions of India. It involves broadcasting short-duration pulses or oilseeds into the standing rice crop approximately two weeks before rice harvest.  This maximizes land use efficiency and boosts farmers' income by producing two crops from the same land area in a single cropping season.


**8. With reference to Green Manuring, consider the following statements:**

1. Green manuring primarily involves the use of chemical fertilizers to enrich the soil.
2. Green manuring utilizes leguminous plants to improve soil fertility and structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

2.  All fungi establish mycorrhizal associations with plant roots, contributing significantly to plant growth and nutrient cycling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While spore production is a common reproductive method for fungi, it's not exclusive.  Many fungal species reproduce both sexually and asexually, employing diverse mechanisms like budding or fragmentation in addition to spores.  The statement oversimplifies the reproductive diversity within the Kingdom Fungi.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mycorrhizal associations are indeed crucial for many plants and fungi, facilitating nutrient exchange. However, not all fungi form mycorrhizae.  Many fungal species are saprophytes (decomposers), parasites, or have other ecological roles unrelated to mycorrhizal relationships. The statement presents a generalization that doesn't hold true for the entire fungal kingdom.  The diversity of fungal lifestyles and interactions within ecosystems is far more complex than suggested.


**2. With reference to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WNBR is solely managed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), reflecting a single governing body for global biosphere reserve designations.
2.  The Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme, under which WNBR operates, was established in the year 2000 to address emerging global environmental challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNESCO's Man and Biosphere Programme plays a central role in the WNBR, the IUCN is not the sole governing body.  The WNBR is a collaborative network involving various international organizations, national governments, and local communities.  The statement falsely implies exclusive control by the IUCN, overlooking the multi-stakeholder nature of biosphere reserve management.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MAB Programme was launched much earlier, in 1971, under UNESCO. Its establishment predates the year 2000 by several decades. The statement incorrectly places the launch date, underestimating the program's long history in addressing environmental conservation and sustainable development.


**3. With reference to Coral Bleaching, consider the following statements:**

1.  Coral bleaching is primarily caused by increased ocean acidity, resulting from the absorption of excess atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ocean acidification is a significant threat to coral reefs, it's not the primary cause of bleaching.  The most immediate and significant trigger for coral bleaching is increased water temperature due to climate change.  Other factors like pollution, runoff, and extreme low tides also contribute to bleaching events. The statement overemphasizes ocean acidity as the sole driver, ignoring other crucial environmental stressors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023-2024 bleaching event in Lakshadweep affected a wide range of coral species, including both stress-tolerant and less-tolerant types.  The statement incorrectly limits the impact to only stress-tolerant species, underrepresenting the severity and breadth of the bleaching observed.


**4. With reference to Plankton Blooms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Plankton blooms are exclusively caused by an overabundance of nutrients in the water, leading to unchecked population growth.
2.  Plankton crashes, resulting in mass mortality, are solely triggered by a sudden depletion of carbon dioxide in the water.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While nutrient availability is a critical factor in plankton blooms, it's not the only driver.  Other factors like changes in water temperature, sunlight availability, and the presence of specific phytoplankton species also influence bloom formation.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of a complex ecological phenomenon.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Plankton crashes can occur due to various factors, including nutrient depletion, changes in water quality (e.g., salinity, temperature), the presence of toxins, or even viral infections.  Carbon dioxide depletion is not the sole cause of plankton crashes; the statement focuses on a single factor while ignoring others that can trigger similar events.


**5. With reference to Gape Limitation and Megafauna, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gape limitation primarily affects the predator-prey dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, having minimal impact on aquatic environments.
2.  Extinct megafaunal species, such as woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers, were exclusively megaherbivores and megacarnivores, respectively, lacking omnivorous species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gape limitation is a fundamental ecological principle that applies to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  The size of a predator's mouth constrains the size of prey it can consume, influencing food web structure and species interactions across various habitats.  The statement incorrectly restricts the applicability of gape limitation to only terrestrial environments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While woolly mammoths were megaherbivores and saber-toothed tigers were megacarnivores, the category of megafauna includes species with diverse dietary habits.  Extinct megafauna included omnivorous species as well. The statement presents an oversimplified classification of extinct megafauna, ignoring the diversity of their dietary strategies.


**6. With reference to Stromatolites and Environmental DNA (eDNA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Stromatolites are exclusively found in deep-sea environments, reflecting their adaptation to extreme pressure and low light conditions.
2.  Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a costly and unreliable method for detecting species and assessing biodiversity compared to conventional methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the NRP's core features. It correctly highlights its continent-wide scope, the presence of binding restoration targets, the inclusion of various ecosystems (wetlands, forests, grasslands), and the mechanism for implementation through national plans.  Statement 1 is slightly inaccurate regarding the percentage target.  The NRP aims to restore at least *20%*, not 30%, of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030. The statement also oversimplifies the EU's net-zero goal by linking it directly to the NRP's restoration targets. While both are part of the broader European Green Deal, they are distinct goals. Therefore, only statement 2 provides a fully accurate representation of the NRP.


**7. With reference to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The EUDR aims to prevent deforestation and forest degradation globally by imposing stringent regulations on the import of agricultural products such as coffee, tea, and rubber into the EU market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly describes the EUDR's main purpose and mechanism. The regulation focuses on verifying the origin of specific products (palm oil, soy, beef, cocoa, and timber) to prevent the import of goods linked to deforestation.  This acts as a market-based mechanism to pressure exporting countries to adopt sustainable practices.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The EUDR does not cover coffee, tea, and rubber.  The statement also overstates the regulation's scope by implying a global ban rather than focusing specifically on goods entering the EU market. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the EUDR's core function and the products it encompasses.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the SEEA's application and the information presented in EnviStats India 2024.  The SEEA framework encompasses a wide range of environmental and economic data, including those mentioned in the statement.  The use of both SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA approaches is also correctly identified.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the SEEA does measure the interactions between the economy and the environment, it does not *primarily* focus on the monetary valuation of natural resources and ecosystem services.  The SEEA provides a broader framework for understanding these interactions, including physical and qualitative aspects beyond monetary valuation. Therefore, only statement 2 fully captures the SEEA's scope and application.


**11. With reference to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), consider the following statements:**

This highlights a significant advantage of UCG in terms of land use efficiency and reduced environmental impact compared to traditional methods.  The reduced land requirement is a crucial aspect for sustainable energy production, especially in regions with limited land availability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text mentions "Concerns: Induced Subsidence; Contamination of Groundwater; Unsteady-state process etc."  Groundwater contamination is explicitly identified as a key environmental concern associated with UCG. This is because the process involves injecting oxidants into the coal seam, which can potentially leach into and contaminate the surrounding groundwater aquifers.  The potential for groundwater contamination necessitates stringent environmental regulations and monitoring during UCG operations.  Failure to address this concern can lead to long-term environmental damage and health risks.


**2. With reference to the National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMNF aims to cover 12 lakh hectares in 600 major blocks across India within a period of six years.
2.  The NMNF, initially known as Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP), was implemented as a sub-scheme under the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY) until 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMNF aims to cover a significant area, the provided text states that the initial aim was to cover 12 lakh hectares in 600 major blocks. However, it does *not* specify a timeframe of six years for achieving this goal. The timeframe is associated with the earlier BPKP scheme, which was later renamed and expanded. The actual timeframe for achieving the 12 lakh hectare target under the NMNF is not explicitly stated in the given information.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that BPKP (later renamed NMNF) was initiated for a period of six years (2019-25) and was made a sub-scheme under PKVY in 2019. This shows the NMNF's evolution from a sub-scheme to a standalone Centrally Sponsored Scheme.  The information accurately reflects the historical development and administrative context of the NMNF.


**3. With reference to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NDRF provides supplementary funding to states when disaster-related expenditure exceeds their capacity.
2. The SDRF is the nodal agency for implementing disaster relief and response activities at the state level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the NDRF R&R window assists states with additional funds when expenditure exceeds their coping capacity. This clarifies the supplementary role of the NDRF in supporting states during large-scale disasters where state resources are insufficient.  This mechanism ensures that critical relief and recovery efforts are not hampered by budgetary constraints at the state level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly identifies the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), not the SDRF, as the nodal agency for implementation.  The SDRF provides the financial resources, but the SDMA is responsible for the on-the-ground coordination and execution of disaster response activities.  Confusing the roles of the SDRF and SDMA demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of the disaster management framework in India.


**4. With reference to FloodWatch India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FloodWatch India version 2.0 monitors over 500 flood monitoring stations and 150 major reservoirs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on environmental topics.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB is a constitutional body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, primarily responsible for air pollution control.
2.  A recent CPCB report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) indicated that a significant portion of environmental funds designated for water pollution mitigation remained unutilized.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and later given powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. While it deals with both air and water pollution, its primary establishment was not solely for air pollution control.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection but doesn't directly establish the CPCB.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly mentions a CPCB report to the NGT highlighting the significant unutilized portion of environmental funds. This directly supports the accuracy of statement 2. The focus on water pollution mitigation in statement 2 is a deliberate distractor; the CPCB's responsibilities encompass a wide range of environmental issues.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India:**

1.  The Atlas, released by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), reveals a consistent decline in built-up land area across India since 2005.
2.  Data from the Atlas indicates a substantial increase in double/triple cropping areas over the past 17 years, exceeding 70%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Atlas, released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not ISRO, shows an *increase* in built-up land area, not a decline, since 2005.  This is a key point of the Atlas's findings.  The text explicitly states a 30.77% growth since 2005.  Attributing the Atlas to ISRO and claiming a decline in built-up land are designed as distractors.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Atlas does show a substantial increase in double/triple cropping areas. However, the percentage increase mentioned in the statement (70%) is lower than the actual figure reported in the text (82.22%). While the statement is not entirely accurate regarding the precise percentage, it correctly captures the overall trend of increased double/triple cropping.  The slight discrepancy in the percentage is a deliberate distractor to test the candidate's attention to detail.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGHM was launched in 2023 (not 2022), and while it aims to make India a global hub for green hydrogen production, usage, and export, the text doesn't emphasize international markets as the *primary* focus.  The mission also targets domestic usage and application.  The year and the emphasis on export are deliberate distractors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), not the National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), is the designated SIA for developing standards and regulatory frameworks under the NGHM. This substitution of similar-sounding organizations serves as a key distractor.



**4. Consider the following statements about the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index 2023-24:**

1.  The Index, released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, assesses state-level progress across 17 goals, covering various aspects of sustainable development.
2. A score of 100 on the Index indicates that a State/UT has achieved all targets set for 2030, exceeding expectations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SDG India Index 2023-24, released by NITI Aayog (not the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation), measures progress on 113 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework (not 17 goals).  The incorrect attribution of the releasing agency and the number of goals are designed as distractors.

Statement 2 is correct.  A score of 100 signifies that a State/UT has achieved all targets set for 2030.  The addition of "exceeding expectations" is a deliberate distractor; the score simply reflects achievement of the 2030 targets.

1.  The IDWH scheme, a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, primarily focuses on the creation of new protected areas.
2. A key component of the IDWH scheme involves support for protected areas, encompassing national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and community reserves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IDWH scheme aims to improve wildlife habitats, its primary focus isn't solely on creating *new* protected areas.  It encompasses support for existing protected areas and conservation efforts outside them.  The emphasis on only new protected areas is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the IDWH scheme supports existing protected areas, including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the scheme's components.


**1. With reference to India's climate negotiation stance at UNFCCC-COP29, consider the following statements:**

1. India proposed a goal of $1.3 trillion annually under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) framework, with half of the funding coming from grants or equivalent resources.
2. India supported the establishment of the Baku Road Map and opposed the use of third-party databases for measuring progress on adaptation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India did propose a substantial annual funding goal under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) framework at COP29, the figure was for $1.3 trillion annually under the  New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), not NDCs.  Furthermore, the proposed funding breakdown wasn't precisely half from grants; the proposal specified $600 billion from grants or equivalent resources. This discrepancy makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. India's position at COP29 included support for the Baku Road Map, a framework for cooperation on climate action.  Simultaneously, India voiced its opposition to the reliance on third-party databases for tracking adaptation progress, emphasizing the need for clear, independently verifiable indicators.  This reflects India's stance on data sovereignty and the need for transparent and equitable measurement methodologies.  The other aspects of India's stance, such as opposing changes to the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) or the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, are not directly addressed in this statement, and their omission does not impact the correctness of statement 2.

1. The GFC Fund was established during the fourth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM4) in 2022 and is primarily funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF).
2. The GFC Fund's projects focus exclusively on high-income countries to address the challenges of chemical waste management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GFC Fund was established during the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), not the fourth, in 2023, in Bonn, Germany.  Also, while the GFC Fund complements existing financial mechanisms like the Global Environment Facility (GEF), it is not primarily funded by the GEF. It relies on voluntary contributions from various sources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GFC Fund explicitly targets low- and middle-income countries, including small island developing states (SIDS), to support safe and sustainable chemical and waste management.  Its focus is on strengthening national and regional capacities to address chemical risks, contrary to the statement's assertion of focusing exclusively on high-income countries.


**4. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) primarily focuses on measuring the economic value of ecosystem services provided by natural assets like forests and rivers.
2. The EnviStats India 2024 report, released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), utilizes the SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) framework for compiling environmental statistics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

2. The WGEEP's zonal classification of the Western Ghats included three categories: ESZ1 (very high sensitivity), ESZ2 (high sensitivity), and ESZ3 (moderate sensitivity).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the WGEEP did recommend designating the entire Western Ghats region as an ESA, it did not advocate for uniform regulations across all zones.  The committee's report proposed a differentiated approach, recognizing the varying levels of ecological sensitivity within the region.  A uniform approach would have been impractical and potentially detrimental to development in less sensitive areas.  The differentiated approach allowed for a more nuanced and balanced approach to conservation and development.


Statement 2 is correct. The WGEEP's zonal classification indeed included three categories: ESZ1 (very high sensitivity), ESZ2 (high sensitivity), and ESZ3 (moderate sensitivity). This classification reflects the varying degrees of ecological sensitivity within the Western Ghats and provides a framework for implementing appropriate conservation and development measures in different zones. The zonal classification allowed for a more targeted approach to conservation efforts, focusing resources and attention on the most ecologically sensitive areas.


**9.  With reference to the  Ganges River Dolphin, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ganges River Dolphin possesses a well-developed crystalline eye lens, enabling it to navigate effectively in murky river waters.
2. The Ganges River Dolphin plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy fish populations within its river ecosystem.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ganges River Dolphin does *not* possess a well-developed crystalline eye lens; it is effectively blind.  It navigates and hunts using a highly developed echolocation system, emitting ultrasonic sounds to locate prey and orient itself in its environment.  The lack of a functional eye lens is an adaptation to its life in murky river waters, where vision would be limited.


Statement 2 is correct. The Ganges River Dolphin is a top predator in its river ecosystem and plays a crucial role in regulating fish populations.  By controlling the numbers of certain fish species, the dolphin helps maintain the overall health and balance of the river ecosystem.  Its presence or absence is therefore a strong indicator of the health of the entire river system.  The loss of this apex predator can lead to imbalances in the food web and a decline in the overall health of the river ecosystem.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the  UN-REDD Programme:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme's primary focus is on advancing the Paris Agreement by promoting afforestation and reforestation initiatives globally.
2.  The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlights that a significant number of the top countries with high rates of tropical deforestation lack quantified targets on forests in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UN-REDD Programme contributes to the Paris Agreement's goals, its focus is broader than just afforestation and reforestation.  The programme aims to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) through a range of activities, including capacity building, policy support, and knowledge sharing.  Afforestation and reforestation are important components, but they are not the sole focus of the UN-REDD Programme.


Statement 2 is correct. The UN-REDD Programme's report indeed highlights that only a small fraction of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have quantified targets on forests in their NDCs.  This finding underscores the gap between global commitments to reduce deforestation and the actual implementation of specific targets by major deforestation-prone countries.  The report calls for greater ambition and accelerated action to incorporate forest-related targets into NDCs.


**1. With reference to Mangrove ecosystems, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems classified approximately 50% of the assessed ecosystems as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.
2.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Bay of Bengal mangrove ecosystems are classified as critically endangered according to the State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems, a headline indicator for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, assessed 36 regions across 44 countries and found that about 50% of the examined ecosystems fell into the vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered categories.  This highlights the significant threat to these vital coastal ecosystems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report actually classifies the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the Bay of Bengal mangrove ecosystems as being of "Least Concern," indicating a relatively healthy status compared to other regions. The South Indian mangroves were identified as critically endangered, not the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Bay of Bengal.  This discrepancy underscores the importance of consulting reliable sources and recognizing regional variations in mangrove health.  The ISFR 2023 also supports this finding, showing an increase in mangrove cover in India.  The confusion might arise from mixing information from different reports and regions.


**2. With reference to India's initiatives for Mangrove conservation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "MISHTI" initiative aims to increase tangible incomes through mangrove conservation, focusing solely on economic benefits.
2.  The "Magical Mangroves" campaign is a solely government-led initiative aimed at raising awareness among citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes) does aim to increase incomes through mangrove conservation, it's not solely focused on economic benefits.  The initiative also aims to improve shoreline habitats, encompassing ecological restoration as a key component.  The economic benefits are a positive outcome of improved ecosystem health, not the sole objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Magical Mangroves" campaign, while aimed at raising awareness among citizens regarding mangrove conservation, is not solely a government-led initiative.  It is a collaborative effort involving WWF India and citizens in nine coastal states. This emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and citizen engagement in conservation efforts.  The campaign's success relies on community participation and collective action, transcending government-only involvement.


**3. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The EPI 2024 ranks countries based on 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories, including factors like climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection.
2.  India's ranking in the EPI 2024 reflects its recent surge as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2, surpassing China in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The EPI 2024, published by the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy, indeed uses 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories to rank 180 countries. These categories comprehensively assess aspects of environmental health, climate change performance, and ecosystem vitality.  The methodology is robust and considers a wide range of factors relevant to environmental sustainability.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While it is true that India surpassed China as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2 in 2022, this is only one factor among many considered in the EPI.  The EPI ranking doesn't solely depend on a single pollutant; it's a holistic assessment.  Therefore, attributing India's ranking *solely* to its SO2 emissions is an oversimplification and a potential distractor. The statement creates a false causal link.  Many other factors contribute to a country's overall EPI score.


**4. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PBR is a legally mandated document under the Biological Diversity Act (2002), prepared by the Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) in consultation with local communities.
2.  The PBR primarily focuses on documenting the economic value of local biological resources, neglecting traditional knowledge associated with them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PBR is indeed a statutory requirement under the Biological Diversity Act (2002).  The Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) are responsible for its preparation, ensuring local communities are involved in the process. This participatory approach is crucial for recognizing and respecting traditional knowledge and local ownership of biodiversity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PBR's purpose is not limited to documenting the economic value of resources.  It aims to document and safeguard *both* bioresources and the associated traditional knowledge.  This includes medicinal uses, cultural significance, and other traditional practices related to the resources.  The focus is on holistic documentation, recognizing the intertwined nature of biodiversity and cultural heritage.  The statement misrepresents the scope and objectives of the PBR.


**5. With reference to the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IBCA was launched by India in 2023, marking the 50th anniversary of Project Tiger, and aims to conserve seven big cat species globally.
2.  The IBCA is solely funded by India and its membership is restricted to countries inhabiting the seven big cat species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The IBCA was indeed launched by India in 2023 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Project Tiger.  Its primary aim is to strengthen global cooperation for the conservation of seven big cat species (tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, cheetah, jaguar, and puma) and their habitats. This demonstrates India's commitment to global conservation efforts and its leadership role in big cat protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India provided initial funding (Rs. 150 crores for five years), the IBCA is not solely funded by India. It's a multi-country and multi-agency coalition, open to participation from all UN member countries and various international organizations.  Limiting membership to only those countries that currently have the seven big cat species would severely restrict participation and limit the alliance's effectiveness in global conservation.  The statement erroneously restricts funding and membership.


**6. With reference to the UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlights that only a small fraction of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have quantified forest-related targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2.  The UN-REDD Programme focuses solely on afforestation and reforestation efforts to mitigate climate change, neglecting the importance of reducing deforestation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The UN-REDD (United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) report indeed highlighted the concerning fact that only a minority of the top 20 countries with high deforestation rates have included quantified forest targets in their NDCs. This points to a significant gap in global efforts to address deforestation and its contribution to climate change. The report emphasizes the need for stronger commitments and more ambitious targets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-REDD Programme's focus is not solely on afforestation and reforestation. While these are important aspects of forest conservation, the programme also strongly emphasizes the critical need to reduce deforestation, recognizing that this is a primary driver of greenhouse gas emissions. The statement misrepresents the program's comprehensive approach to forest conservation and climate change mitigation.  Reducing deforestation is paramount in the UN-REDD strategy.


**7. With reference to the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SFTLC, supported by the Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC), aims to mobilize US$1 billion in additional funding by 2034 for tiger conservation and its landscapes.
2.  The TCC is a government-led initiative focused exclusively on funding mechanisms for tiger conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SFTLC, hosted by Bhutan and supported by the TCC, does indeed aim to secure US$1 billion in additional funding by 2034 to support tiger conservation and its landscapes. This ambitious goal underscores the need for increased financial resources to tackle the challenges facing tiger populations and their habitats. The Paro Statement reflects this commitment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The TCC (Tiger Conservation Coalition) is an *independent* group of organizations, not a government-led initiative. It brings together leading biologists, experts, and organizations such as IUCN, UNDP, WCS, and WWF, to promote tiger conservation.  While funding is a crucial aspect of their work, their focus extends beyond just funding mechanisms to encompass a wider range of conservation strategies and collaborations. The statement incorrectly characterizes the TCC's nature and scope.


**8.  With reference to the  State of the Rhino 2024 Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report, released by the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), indicates that there are fewer than 28,000 rhinos remaining globally, across all five species.
2.  The report shows a significant decrease in the population of the greater one-horned rhino (Indian rhino) in 2023 compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The State of the Rhino 2024 Report, published by the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), accurately states that there are fewer than 28,000 rhinos left worldwide, encompassing all five rhino species. This underscores the precarious conservation status of these magnificent animals and the urgent need for effective conservation strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report does not indicate a *decrease* in the population of the greater one-horned rhino (Indian rhino) in 2023.  In fact, while the overall rhino numbers are concerning, the report notes the Indian rhino population remained *stable* during the reporting period. This highlights the importance of accurate reporting and avoiding generalizations in interpreting conservation data. The statement misrepresents the specific findings on the Indian rhino population.


**9. With reference to the Lesser Florican Conservation Project, consider the following statements:**

1. The FAC is a statutory body under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, responsible for approving the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes.
2. The FAC's recommendations regarding forest land diversion for non-forestry use are legally binding and cannot be overruled.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FAC (Forest Advisory Committee) is indeed a statutory body established under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC). Its primary role is to assess proposals for diverting forest land for non-forest purposes.  The committee plays a crucial role in balancing development needs with forest conservation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FAC's role is *recommendatory* in nature.  While its assessments and recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding. The final decision on forest land diversion rests with the government, which can accept, modify, or reject the FAC's recommendations. The statement misrepresents the FAC's authority and decision-making power.  The statement gives a misleading impression of the FAC's power.


**1. With reference to Fungi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fungi are primarily autotrophic organisms, deriving their energy from sunlight through photosynthesis.
2.  The cell walls of fungi are composed of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, meaning they obtain their nutrients by absorbing organic matter from their environment. They do not produce their own food through photosynthesis like plants.  They can be saprophytic (feeding on dead organic matter) or parasitic (feeding on living organisms).  This fundamental difference in nutritional strategy distinguishes fungi from plants.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Fungal cell walls are primarily composed of chitin, a tough, nitrogen-containing polysaccharide. Cellulose is the main structural component of plant cell walls. The presence of chitin is a key characteristic that differentiates fungal cell walls from those of plants.  This difference reflects the distinct evolutionary pathways of fungi and plants.  The contrasting cell wall compositions have implications for the ecological roles and physiological properties of these two kingdoms.


**2. With reference to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The WNBR is managed solely by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a leading international conservation organization.
2.  The primary aim of the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme is to promote sustainable development by fostering a harmonious relationship between people and their environments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WNBR is a network of biosphere reserves established under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB Programme).  While WWF and other organizations may contribute to the management and conservation efforts within individual biosphere reserves, the overall network is not managed solely by WWF. UNESCO plays a central coordinating role in the global network.

Statement 2 is correct. The MAB Programme, launched in 1971, aims to establish a scientific basis for improving the relationships between people and their environments.  This involves promoting sustainable development, biodiversity conservation, and the wise use of natural resources, recognizing the interconnectedness of human well-being and environmental health. The program strives to create a balance between conservation and human needs within biosphere reserves and beyond.


**3. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Areas (ESAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ESAs are notified by state governments under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
2.  The primary purpose of designating an ESA is to promote unrestricted economic development within environmentally sensitive regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Eco-Sensitive Areas (ESAs) are notified by the central government under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, not by state governments under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. While the Wildlife Protection Act deals with the conservation of wildlife, the Environment (Protection) Act has a broader scope, encompassing various environmental concerns, including the designation of ESAs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary purpose of designating an ESA is to protect and conserve the fragile ecosystems and biodiversity within those areas.  This involves regulating or restricting certain human activities that could negatively impact the environment.  The goal is to strike a balance between development and conservation, prioritizing the long-term health of the ecosystem.  Unrestricted economic development is the antithesis of ESA objectives.


**4. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB is a non-statutory body established under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
2.  The CPCB is primarily responsible for implementing legislation related to the prevention and control of water pollution in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body, established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.  Its statutory status gives it legal authority to carry out its functions. It functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change but its existence is not dependent on the ministry's will.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not complete. While the CPCB is indeed involved in implementing legislation related to water pollution, its responsibilities extend to air pollution as well.  It is entrusted with powers and functions under both the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate in its scope.


**5. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

**6. With reference to soil acidification, consider the following statements:**

1. Soil acidification leads to increased nutrient availability for plants, promoting healthy growth.
2. Liming, the application of alkaline materials to soil, is a common method for managing acid soils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Soil acidification actually decreases nutrient availability for plants. The increased acidity can lead to the leaching of essential nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and potassium, making them less accessible to plant roots.  Furthermore, increased acidity can increase the solubility of toxic metals like aluminum, which can harm plant growth.

Statement 2 is correct. Liming is a widely used and effective method for managing acid soils.  The application of lime (calcium carbonate) or other alkaline materials neutralizes the acidity, raising the soil pH to a more favorable range for plant growth. This improves nutrient availability and reduces the toxicity of certain elements.


**7. With reference to the “grasshopper effect,” consider the following statements:**

1. The grasshopper effect primarily refers to the long-range transport of pollutants through oceanic currents.
2.  The Arctic region serves as a significant sink for pollutants transported via the grasshopper effect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the grasshopper effect involves long-range transport of pollutants, it primarily refers to atmospheric transport.  Pollutants are carried by air currents from lower latitudes to higher latitudes, accumulating in regions like the Arctic.  Oceanic currents play a role in the distribution of pollutants, but the grasshopper effect specifically describes atmospheric transport.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arctic region acts as a significant sink for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and other toxic substances transported via the grasshopper effect.  These pollutants are volatile and can evaporate into the atmosphere at lower latitudes, then condense and deposit in colder, higher-latitude regions.  This phenomenon contributes to the accumulation of pollutants in the Arctic environment, posing risks to wildlife and human health.


**8. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA is a framework developed solely by the World Bank to measure the economic value of natural resources.
2.  SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) focuses on measuring individual environmental resources and their use by the economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEA is an internationally agreed-upon statistical framework developed by the United Nations, not solely by the World Bank. It provides a standardized approach for integrating environmental information into national economic accounts, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the economy and the environment. Many international organizations contribute to the framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) focuses on measuring the ecosystems themselves and the services they provide to the economy and human well-being.  SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) is the one that measures individual environmental resources and their use by the economy. The distinction lies in whether the focus is on individual resources or entire ecosystems and their functions.


**9. With reference to the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI), consider the following statements:**

1. FERI is a joint initiative between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank.
2. FERI primarily supports the implementation of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FERI is a partnership between the Korea Forest Service (KFS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat, not between UNEP and the World Bank.  The CBD is a multilateral treaty under the United Nations, but FERI's direct partnership is with the KFS and the CBD Secretariat.

Statement 2 is correct.  FERI is designed to assist developing countries in implementing national targets and plans aligned with the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (which have now been succeeded by the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework).  It provides support and tools for ecosystem restoration efforts, contributing to global biodiversity conservation goals.  The initiative focuses on practical implementation.


**10. With reference to the European Union’s Nature Restoration Plan (NRP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NRP aims to restore at least 50% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030.
2. The NRP is a non-binding set of recommendations for member states to consider in managing their natural resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRP aims to recover at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030, not 50%. This target represents a significant undertaking but is less ambitious than the figure stated. The 20% target is a step towards the broader goal of restoring all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRP is a legally binding law, not a non-binding set of recommendations.  This means that EU member states are legally obligated to implement the plan's provisions and meet the restoration targets.  The binding nature of the legislation ensures its enforcement and contributes to the EU's broader environmental policy objectives.  The plan's binding nature sets it apart from mere guidance.


**11. With reference to the Lesser Florican conservation project, consider the following statements:**

1. The project is primarily focused on the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard, a critically endangered bird species.
2. The Wildlife Institute of India is the implementing agency for the Lesser Florican conservation project.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IDWH scheme aims to protect wildlife both inside and outside protected areas.  It recognizes that many wildlife species utilize habitats beyond the boundaries of formally designated protected areas, and their conservation requires a broader approach.  The scheme's scope is not limited to protected areas alone.

Statement 2 is correct. Project Tiger is indeed a sub-scheme under the IDWH.  Other notable sub-schemes include Project Elephant, Project Lion, and Project Dolphin, all aimed at the conservation of specific flagship species and their habitats.  This demonstrates the IDWH's multi-pronged approach to wildlife conservation.


**13. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PBR is a centrally mandated register maintained by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.
2.  The primary purpose of the PBR is to document traditional knowledge associated with local biological resources, including their medicinal uses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PBR is not a centrally mandated register maintained by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  Instead, it is prepared at the local level by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in consultation with local communities, as mandated by the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.  This participatory approach ensures local ownership and relevance.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key purpose of the PBR is to document and safeguard traditional knowledge associated with local biological resources, including their medicinal and other uses.  This helps to preserve valuable knowledge, promote sustainable resource management, and support the rights of local communities.  The documentation process involves active participation by local people.


**14. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The EPI 2024 was published by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
2.  The EPI ranks countries based on their performance across various environmental indicators, including climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EPI 2024 was published by Yale University's Center for Environmental Law & Policy, in collaboration with Columbia University's Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), not by the World Economic Forum (WEF).  The WEF publishes various reports, but the EPI is produced by a different academic institution.

Statement 2 is correct. The EPI indeed ranks countries based on their performance across a wide range of environmental indicators. These indicators cover various aspects of environmental sustainability, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, air and water quality, and biodiversity.  The index provides a comprehensive assessment of environmental performance.


**15. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCI primarily evaluates countries' performance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
2.  A lower rank in the NCI indicates better performance in nature conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCI does not primarily evaluate countries' performance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  While climate change is a relevant factor in overall environmental health, the NCI focuses more broadly on nature conservation efforts, using indicators related to biodiversity, land management, threats to biodiversity, capacity and governance, and future trends.  Greenhouse gas emissions are not the primary focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A lower rank in the NCI indicates *worse* performance in nature conservation.  The index ranks countries based on their conservation efforts, with a higher rank indicating better performance.  A lower rank suggests that a country has weaker conservation efforts and greater challenges in protecting its natural resources.  The ranking system is designed to reflect the effectiveness of conservation strategies.


**16. With reference to the UN Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD), consider the following statements:**

1.  UN-REDD is primarily focused on promoting afforestation and reforestation efforts in developed countries.
2.  The UN-REDD report highlighted that a significant number of countries with high rates of tropical deforestation lack quantified targets on forests in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UN-REDD focuses on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in *developing* countries, not developed countries.  The program recognizes that developing countries often have significant forest cover and play a crucial role in global carbon emissions.  The program's support is directed towards helping these countries achieve sustainable forest management.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UN-REDD report indeed highlighted the concerning finding that many countries with high rates of tropical deforestation have not included quantified targets related to forests in their NDCs.  This indicates a gap in the ambition and action needed to address deforestation as a major contributor to climate change. The report emphasizes the need for stronger commitments.


**17. With reference to Camelids, consider the following statements:**

1.  Camelids are exclusively found in the African continent.
2.  The Bactrian camel, characterized by two humps, is commonly found in the Nubra Valley of Ladakh, India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Camelids are found in both Africa and Asia.  The distribution of different camelid species varies across these continents.  While some species are primarily found in Africa, others are found in Asia.  The geographical range of camelids is not limited to a single continent.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bactrian camel, easily identifiable by its two humps, is indeed found in the Nubra Valley of Ladakh, India.  This region provides a suitable habitat for these animals.  The Bactrian camel is adapted to cold, arid environments.  Its presence in Ladakh is a notable example of its adaptation to challenging climatic conditions.

Both statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect because while MISHTI aims to improve coastal community incomes, it does so through a broader approach than just aquaculture. It encompasses shoreline habitat restoration and sustainable income generation through multiple avenues linked to mangrove ecosystems.  Statement 2 is also incorrect because the Magical Mangroves campaign, though a significant citizen engagement initiative by WWF India, focuses on nine coastal states, not all of them.  The scope of the campaign is geographically limited, not encompassing all Indian coastal regions.


**3. With reference to the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The FAC, a statutory body under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, possesses absolute authority to approve or reject all requests for forest land diversion for non-forestry purposes.
2. The FAC's recent exemption for surveys involving the felling of up to 100 trees for hydro and other development projects applies only to projects within designated protected forest areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents the FAC's authority. While the FAC plays a crucial role in assessing and recommending approvals for forest land diversion, its decisions are recommendatory, not absolute.  The final authority rests with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). Statement 2 is also incorrect because the FAC's exemption for surveys involving the felling of up to 100 trees is not limited to protected forest areas; it applies to forest areas generally.  The scope of the exemption is broader than what the statement suggests.


**4. With reference to the UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlights that a majority of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have incorporated quantified forest-related targets into their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The UN-REDD Programme focuses exclusively on afforestation and reforestation initiatives to mitigate climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 contradicts the findings of the UN-REDD report, which indicated that only a minority (8 out of 20) of the top deforestation countries had quantified forest targets in their NDCs.  The statement misrepresents the report's key finding on the lack of comprehensive forest-related targets in many high-deforestation nations. Statement 2 incorrectly limits the UN-REDD Programme's scope. While afforestation and reforestation are important components, the program's focus is broader, encompassing reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. It addresses the root causes of deforestation and promotes sustainable forest management practices.


**5. Consider the following statements about the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA):**

1. SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) primarily focuses on measuring the economic value of ecosystem services provided by natural resources like forests and rivers.
2. SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) measures individual environmental assets and resources and their utilization by the economy, such as timber, water, and fish.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements incorrectly describe the roles of SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA.  Statement 1 mistakenly attributes the function of measuring ecosystem services to SEEA-CF.  In fact, this is the primary role of SEEA-EA. SEEA-CF focuses on measuring individual environmental assets and their use by the economy. Statement 2 incorrectly assigns the measurement of individual resources to SEEA-EA; this is the function of SEEA-CF. The statements have essentially reversed the functionalities of the two frameworks.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ESZs are not designed to completely prohibit all human activities. Their purpose is to create a buffer zone around protected areas, regulating activities to minimize negative impacts while allowing for some sustainable human activities.  A complete prohibition would be impractical and potentially harmful to local communities.

Statement 2 is correct. The ESZ guidelines do indeed categorize activities into prohibited, regulated, and permitted categories based on their potential environmental impact.  Sustainable activities like ongoing agriculture by local communities are generally permitted to balance conservation with the needs of local populations.


**6. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats, extending from north to south, exhibit a consistent elevation with its highest peak, Anamudi, located in the northern part of the range.
2. The Madhav Gadgil committee recommended designating the entire Western Ghats region as an ecologically sensitive area (ESA), dividing it into three zones based on sensitivity levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The elevation of the Western Ghats *progressively increases* from north to south, with its highest peak, Anamudi, located in the southern part (Kerala). The statement reverses this crucial geographical fact.

Statement 2 is correct. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), also known as the Madhav Gadgil committee, did indeed recommend designating the entire Western Ghats region as an ESA, further dividing it into three zones based on their ecological sensitivity.  This recommendation, though debated, reflects the committee's assessment of the region's biodiversity significance.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs):**

1. GLOFs are primarily caused by geological events like earthquakes, and their occurrence is independent of climatic factors such as excessive precipitation.
2.  India's initiatives to manage GLOFs include the development of early warning systems for critical lakes, risk mitigation projects for vulnerable states, and the National Mission on Himalayan Studies.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Illegal sand mining has far-reaching consequences.  It significantly impacts both aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity through habitat loss.  It also damages human infrastructure like bridges and river embankments.  The claim of minimal impact on terrestrial ecosystems and infrastructure is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sand is classified as a *minor*, not major, mineral under the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957. This distinction is crucial as it places the primary responsibility for regulating sand mining with state governments.


**9. Consider the following statements about pre-monsoon winds in India:**

1.  'Aandhi' or 'Kali Aandhi', strong dust storms occurring before the monsoon, primarily affect the coastal regions of southern India, causing minimal disruption to urban areas.
2.  'Mango showers', pre-monsoon rains along the coastal Karnataka and Kerala, are crucial for the early ripening of mangoes and the blossoming of coffee flowers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. 'Aandhi' or 'Kali Aandhi' dust storms affect northwestern and central India, including major cities like Delhi, causing significant pollution and damage. The statement incorrectly limits their impact to southern coastal regions and minimizes the disruptive effects.

Statement 2 is correct.  'Mango showers' are indeed pre-monsoon rains crucial for the early ripening of mangoes in coastal Karnataka and Kerala and also aid in the blossoming of coffee plants.  The statement accurately links these showers to agricultural benefits.


**10. With reference to the naming of undersea features in the Indian Ocean, consider the following statements:**

1.  The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) are solely responsible for proposing names for undersea features discovered within a country's territorial waters.
2.  The naming of undersea features outside territorial waters requires proposals to be reviewed by the IHO Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN) according to the IHO's 2013 guidelines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IHO and IOC are involved in the standardization and approval of names, national authorities are responsible for proposing names for undersea features within their territorial waters.  The statement incorrectly assigns sole responsibility to international bodies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The IHO's 2013 guidelines and the review by the SCUFN are indeed essential steps in the naming process for undersea features located outside territorial waters.  The statement accurately reflects this procedure.


**1. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCI evaluates conservation efforts using five markers: Land management, Threats to biodiversity, Capacity and governance, Future trends, and  Species diversity.
2.  In the 2024 NCI ranking, India secured a position above 150 out of 180 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCI uses four markers to evaluate conservation efforts: Land management, Threats to biodiversity, Capacity and governance, and Future trends.  The addition of "Species diversity" is a distractor, designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the index's components.  A candidate with superficial knowledge might assume a fifth marker exists.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's rank in the 2024 NCI was 176 out of 180 countries. The statement manipulates the actual rank to create a plausible yet incorrect option.  The slight alteration is a common technique used in difficult UPSC-style MCQs to challenge the candidate's recall of precise data. The option plays on the possibility that a candidate might vaguely remember India's poor performance but misremember the exact rank.


**2. Consider the following statements about the UN-REDD Programme:**

1. The UN-REDD report highlights that all of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have included quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The UN-REDD Programme is primarily focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developed nations only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-REDD report actually found that only 8 out of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation had quantified forest targets in their NDCs. This statement reverses the actual finding to create a misleading option. This tests the candidate's ability to discern factual accuracy from a seemingly plausible but incorrect statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UN-REDD Programme focuses on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation globally, not just in developed nations.  The statement limits the scope of the programme, creating a false impression of its regional focus.  This again tests detailed knowledge of the programme's mandate.


**3. With reference to the People's Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PBR is prepared by the State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs) in consultation with local communities.
2. Information included in the PBR primarily focuses on the commercial value of local biological resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PBR is prepared by the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs), not the State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs), in consultation with local people. The substitution of BMCs with SBBs is a subtle but significant error that tests the candidate's precise understanding of institutional roles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PBR documents a broader range of information than just the commercial value of resources; it includes traditional knowledge associated with local biological resources and their medicinal or other uses.  The statement narrows the scope of the PBR's content, thus creating a misleading option.


**4. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The EPI 2024 ranks countries based on 48 performance indicators across 10 issue categories.
2.  India's ranking in EPI 2024 reflects significant improvements in air quality compared to previous years.

2. The Department of Fisheries is promoting artificial reefs under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description of materials used and the purpose of artificial reefs is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Department of Fisheries promotes artificial reefs under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, not the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana.  The substitution of one scheme for another tests the candidate's precise knowledge of government programmes.



**1. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPCB is a constitutional body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and primarily focuses on air pollution control.
2.  The CPCB, in collaboration with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), is responsible for enforcing environmental legislation, including water pollution control, but its primary mandate is air pollution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body, not a constitutional body.  It was established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. While it addresses both air and water pollution, its establishment predates the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and its focus isn't solely on air pollution.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that the CPCB works with SPCBs on environmental legislation enforcement. However, it's inaccurate to say its primary mandate is air pollution. The CPCB's responsibilities encompass both air and water pollution control, along with other environmental concerns, under various acts.  The statement oversimplifies the CPCB's broad mandate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the National Green Tribunal (NGT):**

1. The NGT is a quasi-judicial body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and handles only cases related to environmental compensation.
2.  The NGT's orders are binding, and non-compliance can lead to penalties, but only for cases directly referred to it by the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGT is indeed a quasi-judicial body established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (not the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986). Its jurisdiction extends beyond environmental compensation cases; it handles a wide range of environmental disputes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NGT orders are binding and non-compliance can result in penalties, this isn't limited to cases referred solely by the Supreme Court.  The NGT receives cases through various channels and possesses independent authority to issue orders and impose penalties.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDG India Index is released annually by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and assesses progress across all 17 SDGs.
2.  A score of 100 on the index indicates that a State/UT has completely achieved all targets for 2030, and higher scores always mean better performance in all SDG areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SDG India Index is released annually, but it's published by NITI Aayog, not the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. While it tracks progress towards the SDGs, it focuses on a subset of indicators rather than all 17 SDGs comprehensively.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A score of 100 signifies that a State/UT has achieved the targets set for 2030 for the *included* indicators.  It doesn't mean complete achievement across all SDG areas, as the index only covers a selection.  Furthermore, a higher score doesn't necessarily translate to superior performance in *every* SDG area; a state might excel in some areas but lag in others.


**4. With reference to the Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The LULC Atlas, released annually by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), primarily focuses on changes in forest cover and provides detailed information on biodiversity changes.
2.  The Atlas demonstrates that built-up land has consistently increased since 2005, indicating urbanization, but there has been a continuous decrease in agricultural land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LULC Atlas is released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not ISRO. While it does show changes in land use, including forest cover, its primary focus is broader than just forest cover and biodiversity.  It provides a comprehensive overview of various land use types.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atlas indicates an increase in built-up land since 2005, reflecting urbanization. However, it also shows an expansion of Kharif and Rabi cropland and an increase in double/triple cropping areas, contradicting the claim of a continuous decrease in agricultural land.


**5. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SEEA is a nationally mandated framework for compiling environmental statistics, primarily focused on India's Gross Environment Product (GEP).
2.  The SEEA framework includes both the SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) and SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA), providing a comprehensive view of the economy-environment interaction,  but it does not include ocean accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEA is an *internationally* agreed framework, not a nationally mandated one specific to India. While India uses it to compile environmental statistics, including aspects related to the GEP, the SEEA's scope is global.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SEEA does indeed encompass both SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA, offering a comprehensive perspective on the economy-environment interaction.  The provided text explicitly mentions that EnviStats India 2024 includes ocean accounts within the SEEA framework, contradicting the statement.


**6. With reference to the Global Framework on Chemicals and Waste (GFC) Fund, consider the following statements:**

1. The GFC Fund, established during ICCM5 in 2023, primarily supports high-income countries in managing chemicals and waste, focusing on large-scale projects.

1.  The primary global initiative for GLOF management is the UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), focusing on international cooperation and financial aid.
2.  India's GLOF management efforts primarily concentrate on the Himalayan region, starting with Tenchungkha lake in Sikkim and extending to other identified lakes in various Himalayan states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While international cooperation is crucial for GLOF management, the UN's primary initiative isn't solely the ISDR. Several other organizations, like ICIMOD, UNESCO, and the Sendai Framework, play significant roles. The ISDR is focused on disaster risk reduction more broadly, not exclusively GLOFs.

Statement 2 is correct. India's GLOF management strategy centers on the Himalayan region, beginning with Tenchungkha lake in Sikkim and encompassing other identified lakes in states like Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.


**9. With reference to the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The BBNJ Agreement applies to all areas beyond national jurisdiction, including the high seas, but excludes any area claimed by a nation as its exclusive economic zone.
2. The Agreement establishes a Conference of Parties (COP) as the primary decision-making body, and a financial mechanism involving voluntary and special trust funds and the Global Facility Fund is established.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The BBNJ Agreement does apply to areas beyond national jurisdiction, encompassing the high seas.  The clarification regarding areas claimed by nations as exclusive economic zones is implicit because the agreement deals with areas *beyond* national jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is correct. The BBNJ Agreement does indeed establish a COP as the principal decision-making body, and it includes a financial mechanism incorporating voluntary and special trust funds, as well as utilizing the Global Facility Fund.


**10. With reference to the United Nations Water Convention, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Water Convention (Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes) is a non-binding agreement, promoting cooperation but not imposing strict legal obligations.
2.  India is a signatory to the UN Water Convention, reflecting its commitment to equitable and sustainable transboundary water management, and the Indus Waters Treaty aligns with its principles.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN Water Convention is a *legally binding* agreement. It obligates parties to utilize transboundary waters reasonably and equitably, ensuring sustainable management.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India is *not* a party to the UN Water Convention. The Indus Waters Treaty, while addressing transboundary water issues, is a separate bilateral agreement, not a direct manifestation of India's participation in the UN Water Convention.


**1. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB was established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, primarily focusing on air pollution control.
2.  The CPCB, in collaboration with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), is solely responsible for enforcing the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, not the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. While it does have functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, its initial establishment was linked to water pollution control.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection, but the CPCB's origin predates this act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPCB works in conjunction with SPCBs to implement legislation related to pollution prevention and control, including the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, it isn't solely responsible.  The SPCBs have significant independent roles and responsibilities in enforcing the act within their respective states.  The CPCB provides overall guidance and coordination but the enforcement largely rests with the SPCBs at the state level.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the shared responsibility.


**2. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The SDG India Index, released annually in July, assesses progress across all states and union territories based on 17 goals, each with specific targets to be achieved by 2030.
2.  States scoring between 50-64 are categorized as ‘Achievers’, demonstrating substantial progress towards achieving the SDG targets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The SDG India Index, released by NITI Aayog, tracks the progress of states and union territories on 113 indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework. These indicators relate to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with targets set for 2030.  The index is indeed published annually, although the exact month might vary.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SDG India Index categorizes states into four tiers: Achievers (scoring 100), Front Runners (65-99), Performers (50-64), and Aspirants (0-49).  The description of states scoring between 50-64 as ‘Achievers’ is inaccurate; they are categorized as ‘Performers’.  This highlights a crucial detail that differentiates the actual categorization from the statement's claim.


**3. With reference to the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCEW is a permanent body established under the auspices of the United Nations, tasked with regularly reviewing global water resource management policies.
2. The report "The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Good" was released by the GCEW in 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCEW is not a permanent body.  It was an independent commission launched in May 2022 with a two-year mandate, meaning its existence was temporary.  It was not established under the UN but convened by the Government of the Netherlands with facilitation by the OECD. The statement incorrectly portrays its nature and affiliation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GCEW did indeed release the report "The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Good," the provided text does not specify the year of release.  The fact that the commission had a two-year mandate (beginning in 2022) suggests the release was likely within that timeframe (2022-2024), but the statement is not precise enough to be considered factually correct.


**4. With reference to the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI), consider the following statements:**

1. Uttarakhand is the first Indian state to implement GEPI, focusing on quantifying the contribution of natural ecosystems to the economy and overall welfare, with a particular emphasis on carbon sequestration.
2. The GEPI calculation involves a weighted average of four key environmental indicators: air quality, water quality, soil health, and forest cover, using a standardized methodology across all states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Uttarakhand was indeed the first Indian state to launch a GEPI. The index aims to evaluate ecological development impacted by human interventions and quantifies the contributions of natural ecosystems. While carbon sequestration is an important aspect of environmental health, it's not explicitly stated as the *primary* focus of the GEPI in the provided text.  The focus is broader, encompassing air, soil, water, and forest resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text mentions that the GEPI is calculated using a sum of four indicators (air, water, soil, and forest), not a weighted average.  The formula given is a simple summation. Furthermore, a standardized methodology across all states is not mentioned in the text.  The method’s applicability is limited to Uttarakhand initially, and its future adoption by other states is not guaranteed to involve a standardized approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NWA explicitly recognizes achievements across multiple levels—state, district, village, and urban local bodies—demonstrating a comprehensive approach to acknowledging contributions to water conservation.  The description falsely limits the award's scope to only national-level achievements, ignoring the significant recognition given to state and local initiatives.


**6. With reference to the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCEW is a permanent body established under the United Nations, tasked with providing policy recommendations on water resource management to member states.
2.  The GCEW's 2023 report, "The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Good," emphasizes the economic value of water resources and advocates for integrated water resource management.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCEW is an *independent* commission, not a permanent UN body.  It was launched in 2022 with a two-year mandate. The statement incorrectly positions it as a permanent UN entity with ongoing responsibilities.  Its nature is temporary and task-specific, not a continuously functioning UN organ.

Statement 2 is correct. The GCEW did release a report titled "The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Good" which highlights the economic importance of water and promotes integrated water resource management practices. This accurately reflects the report's core message and the commission's objectives.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Global Framework on Chemicals and Waste (GFC) Fund:**

1. The GFC Fund, established in 2022, provides financial assistance exclusively to high-income countries to support their efforts in implementing the Global Framework on Chemicals and Waste.
2.  The GFC Fund's projects typically focus on large-scale infrastructure development projects aimed at enhancing chemical waste management capabilities in recipient countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GFC Fund was established during the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in 2023 (not 2022), and it specifically targets low- and middle-income countries, including small island developing states, to help them safely and sustainably manage chemicals and waste. High-income countries are not the primary beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The GFC Fund supports medium-scale projects (not large-scale infrastructure projects) that strengthen national and regional capacities to manage chemicals and waste.  The focus is on capacity building and institutional strengthening, not large-scale infrastructure development. The emphasis is on enhancing abilities and knowledge rather than solely on infrastructure.


**8. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA, developed by the United Nations, provides a standardized framework for integrating environmental information into national accounts, focusing primarily on monetary valuation of ecosystem services.
2.  India's EnviStats, released annually by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), fully adopts the SEEA framework, providing comprehensive data on all aspects of environmental accounting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SEEA is a UN-developed framework for integrating environmental and economic data, it doesn't focus *primarily* on monetary valuation of ecosystem services.  It offers a broader approach encompassing physical and monetary accounts, aiming to provide a holistic picture of the economy's interaction with the environment.  Monetary valuation is one aspect, but not the central focus.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  India's EnviStats utilizes the SEEA framework, but it doesn't claim to provide *comprehensive* data on all aspects of environmental accounting.  The data presented is a selection of indicators relevant to India's context and priorities.  It's a partial implementation and not a complete adoption of the SEEA's full scope.  The description exaggerates the comprehensiveness of India's EnviStats.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme:**

1. The MAB Programme, initiated by UNESCO in 1971, focuses exclusively on establishing biosphere reserves in tropical regions to conserve biodiversity hotspots.
2.  India's participation in the MAB Programme has resulted in the recognition of all of its biosphere reserves under the UNESCO's MAB Programme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MAB Programme is a global initiative, not limited to tropical regions. It aims to establish a scientific basis for improving the relationship between people and their environments across various ecosystems and geographical locations.  The description incorrectly restricts its scope to only tropical regions and biodiversity hotspots.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While many Indian biosphere reserves are recognized under the MAB Programme, not *all* of them are.  The statement makes an inaccurate claim of complete recognition. The number recognized under MAB is a subset of the total number of biosphere reserves in India.  The statement is an overgeneralization.


**10. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), consider the following statements:**

1. ESZs are notified by state governments under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, based on recommendations from expert committees.
2.  The regulations within ESZs are uniform across all zones, irrespective of their ecological sensitivity or the type of activities permitted within them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ESZs are notified by the *central* government (not state governments) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  While expert committees may provide recommendations, the final notification power rests with the central authority.  The statement incorrectly assigns the notification power to state governments.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. ESZ regulations are *not* uniform. They are differentiated based on the ecological sensitivity of the area (ESZ 1, ESZ 2, ESZ 3) and the type of activities permitted.  Different zones have different levels of restriction on activities to balance conservation with local needs.  The statement incorrectly assumes uniformity in regulations across all ESZs.


**1. With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB is a constitutional body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and is responsible for implementing all environmental legislation in India.
2.  The CPCB, along with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), is responsible for collecting and utilizing environmental compensation levied under the Polluter Pays Principle.  The funds are primarily sourced from Environment Protection Charges (EPC) imposed on new diesel vehicles in Delhi and NCR.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a *statutory*, not a constitutional, body. It was formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is also entrusted with powers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  While it plays a crucial role in implementing environmental legislation, it doesn't have sole responsibility for all such legislation across India; the SPCBs also play a significant role.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection, but the CPCB's establishment predates this Act.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The CPCB, in conjunction with SPCBs, is responsible for the implementation of the Polluter Pays Principle.  Environmental compensation is indeed a key mechanism for this. While EPC on new diesel vehicles in Delhi and NCR is one source of these funds, the statement oversimplifies the sources. Environmental compensation can also be levied by order of the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT), as highlighted in the provided text.  Therefore, while the core idea of statement 2 is correct, the specific details about the sources of funding are slightly inaccurate. The emphasis should be on the *principle* and the CPCB's role in its implementation, rather than the specifics of funding sources.


**2.  Consider the following statements regarding the National Green Tribunal (NGT):**

1. The NGT receives environmental compensation funds solely from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which in turn receives these funds primarily through the Environment Protection Charge (EPC) levied on vehicles.
2. The NGT is a statutory body established to handle cases related to environmental protection and pollution control, operating independently of the existing judicial system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NGT does receive environmental compensation funds, it's inaccurate to say that these funds are *solely* from the CPCB or that the CPCB's primary source is vehicle EPCs. The NGT receives funds from various sources, including orders from the Supreme Court and other sources of environmental compensation.  The source material indicates that the CPCB also receives funds from other sources besides vehicle EPCs.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. The NGT is a *statutory*, not an entirely independent, body. It's established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and functions as a specialized environmental court, but it still operates within the broader Indian judicial system. It's not entirely separate from the existing judicial processes; its decisions can be appealed in higher courts.


**3. With reference to the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCEW is a permanent intergovernmental organization established under the auspices of the United Nations, with a mandate to develop and implement global water resource management policies.
2. The GCEW's report, "The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle as a Global Common Good," focuses solely on the economic aspects of water management, neglecting the social and environmental dimensions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCEW is an *independent* commission, not a permanent intergovernmental organization. It was launched with a specific two-year mandate, and its composition includes policymakers and researchers, but it doesn't have the authority to implement global policies.  It's convened by the Government of the Netherlands, with facilitation from the OECD.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCEW's report explicitly addresses the "hydrological cycle as a global common good," indicating a broader scope beyond pure economics. While economic valuation is a core component, the report likely considers social and environmental aspects crucial for sustainable water resource management.  A holistic approach to water management necessitates considering these interconnected dimensions.


**4. With reference to the Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund, consider the following statements:**

1. The GFC Fund, established during ICCM5 in 2023, exclusively focuses on providing financial assistance to high-income countries for the safe management of chemicals and waste.
2.  The Executive Board of the GFC Fund comprises representatives from all United Nations regions and donor countries, ensuring equitable geographical representation in decision-making.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GFC Fund specifically targets *low- and middle-income countries*, including small island developing states.  Its aim is to support these countries in addressing chemicals and waste management according to international standards.  High-income countries are not the primary beneficiaries of this fund.


Statement 2 is correct. The Executive Board's composition includes representatives from each UN region and all donors and contributors, ensuring broad representation in decision-making processes. This structure reflects the fund's global scope and commitment to collaborative action.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index 2023-24:**

1. The SDG India Index 2023-24, released by NITI Aayog, assesses the progress of all states and union territories on 17 goals and 169 targets as defined by the UN.
2.  A score of 100 on the SDG India Index indicates that a state/UT has fully achieved all targets set for 2030, surpassing the global benchmark.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The index assesses progress on 113 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework, not all 17 goals and 169 targets of the UN SDGs.  While the indicators relate to the broader SDG framework, the index uses a more specific subset for its assessment.

Statement 2 is correct. A score of 100 signifies that a state/UT has achieved the targets set for 2030 within the index's framework.  It's important to note that this is a *national* benchmark, not necessarily a global one; the achievement is in relation to India's own targets.  The phrasing of the statement is slightly misleading in implying a global standard.


**6. With reference to the  Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Atlas, released by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), shows a consistent decrease in built-up land across India over the past 17 years, indicating a success in containing urban sprawl.
2. The Atlas reveals an expansion of Kharif and Rabi cropland and a reduction in fallow land over the past 17 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Atlas, released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not ISRO, actually shows an *increase* in built-up land (30.77% since 2005).  The statement misrepresents the findings regarding urban expansion.

Statement 2 is correct. The Atlas does indicate an expansion of Kharif and Rabi cropland and a corresponding decrease in fallow land over the period under consideration.  This observation reflects changes in agricultural land use patterns.


**7. With reference to the  Battery Waste Management Rules 2022 and the role of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the 2022 Rules, the CPCB is empowered to impose environmental compensation (EC) only on producers of batteries who fail to meet their Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) targets.
2.  The CPCB's imposition of EC under the Battery Waste Management Rules 2022 is based solely on the 'polluter pays' principle, without considering any extenuating circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPCB can levy EC on producers for not meeting EPR targets,  the rules also allow for EC to be imposed on entities involved in refurbishment and recycling for non-compliance,  those operating without registration, and those providing false information.  The statement is too narrow in its description of the CPCB's enforcement powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the 'polluter pays' principle is fundamental, the rules don't exclude consideration of other factors.  The assessment of EC likely involves a more nuanced evaluation, although the exact details of this process may not be explicitly stated in the provided text.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of the application of the principle.


**8.  With reference to India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the Paris Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. India's NDCs only include quantitative targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, omitting qualitative targets related to policies and measures.
2.  The Paris Agreement's Article 6, concerning carbon markets, maintains the same limited scope of participation as the Kyoto Protocol, restricting participation to only developed countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's NDCs include targets for GHG emissions, but they also incorporate targets and measures related to policies, such as renewable energy deployment and energy efficiency improvements.  The statement inaccurately limits the scope of India's NDC commitments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Paris Agreement's Article 6 expands the scope of carbon market participation to *all* countries, unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which primarily focused on developed countries.  The statement misrepresents a key difference between the two agreements.


**9. With reference to the  Climate Finance mechanisms and the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCQG, proposed at COP21, aimed to replace the $100 billion annual climate finance target set in 2009, and India fully supported the proposed increase to $300 billion annually by 2035.
2.  The majority of climate finance currently flows towards mitigation actions, with a significantly smaller portion dedicated to adaptation efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NCQG aimed to supersede the $100 billion target, India did *not* fully support the proposed $300 billion figure.  India proposed a significantly higher goal of $1.3 trillion annually, with a substantial portion coming from grants.  The statement misrepresents India's stance on the NCQG.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant portion (around 90%) of climate finance is indeed directed towards mitigation efforts, while adaptation receives a comparatively smaller share.  This imbalance in funding allocation is a subject of ongoing discussion and concern.


**10. With reference to India's Green Credit Programme (GCP), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCP, implemented under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, is a mandatory program requiring all industries to participate and generate green credits.
2.  The Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) plays a central role in the GCP's implementation and administration, including the verification and issuance of green credits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Within this zone, the coastal state exercises full sovereignty, extending to the airspace above and the seabed below. The 24-nautical mile limit applies to the contiguous zone, where the coastal state has limited jurisdiction for specific purposes.

Statement 2 is correct. UNCLOS is a comprehensive international treaty adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.  It establishes a legal framework for various aspects of ocean use, including navigation, maritime boundaries, marine scientific research, and the conservation of marine resources.  It has near-universal acceptance, with a vast majority of the world's nations becoming state parties.  The treaty is a cornerstone of international law related to the oceans.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):**

1. The CBAM is a European Union initiative designed to encourage cleaner industrial production within the EU and incentivize similar practices in other countries.
2. The CBAM requires companies to verify the origin of their products but does not impose any restrictions or barriers on imports into the EU.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a key policy instrument of the European Union aimed at creating a level playing field for European industries and encouraging global decarbonization. By putting a price on carbon embedded in imported goods, the CBAM incentivizes companies outside the EU to reduce their carbon footprint and adopt cleaner production methods.  This mechanism promotes fair competition and encourages international cooperation on climate action.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CBAM is designed to act as a barrier for countries that export carbon-intensive goods to the EU.  By requiring importers to pay a carbon price equivalent to the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), the CBAM effectively increases the cost of these imports, making them less competitive compared to goods produced with lower carbon emissions.  The verification of product origin is a crucial element of the CBAM to ensure its effectiveness.  Therefore, it does indeed impose restrictions and barriers on imports.


**8. With reference to the Baku Climate Unity Pact and outcomes of COP29, consider the following statements:**

1. COP29 finalized the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which deals with international carbon markets, and established a new collective quantified goal on climate finance.
2.  The Baku Climate Unity Pact included a declaration on enhanced climate action in tourism, but no new initiatives were launched concerning energy efficiency or pumped hydro storage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  COP29, held in Baku, Azerbaijan, achieved significant progress on several fronts.  A key outcome was the finalization of the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, resolving long-standing disagreements on international carbon markets.  Furthermore, a new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG), also known as the Baku Finance Goal, was established, aiming to significantly increase financial support for climate action in developing countries.  This demonstrates a strengthened commitment to addressing the financial aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While COP29 did indeed include a declaration on enhanced climate action in tourism, it also saw the launch of several other significant initiatives.  These included the Global Energy Efficiency Alliance, aimed at doubling global energy efficiency rates by 2030, and the Global Alliance for Pumped Storage (GAPS), focusing on the development of pumped hydro storage technologies. These initiatives highlight the multifaceted nature of COP29's outcomes and the broad range of actions undertaken to advance climate action.


**9. With reference to India's stance at COP29, consider the following statements:**

1. India strongly supported the changes proposed to the scope of the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) and alterations to the temperature goals in the Paris Agreement.
2.  India advocated for increased financial and technological support from developed countries to enable a just transition for developing nations and emphasized the need for clear indicators to measure progress on adaptation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's position at COP29 was characterized by a strong emphasis on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).  India opposed attempts to alter the scope of the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) and changes to the temperature goals set in the Paris Agreement.  This reflects India's commitment to the existing framework and its concerns about the potential for disproportionate burden-sharing.

Statement 2 is correct.  India actively advocated for increased financial and technological support from developed countries to facilitate a just and equitable transition for developing nations.  This support is crucial for enabling developing countries to implement climate mitigation and adaptation measures while ensuring sustainable development.  India also stressed the importance of establishing clear and measurable indicators to track progress on adaptation, highlighting the need for effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  This reflects India's focus on practical and effective climate action.


**1. With reference to the phenomenon of Lahars, consider the following statements:**

1. Lahars are rapid flows of volcanic debris, typically consisting of water, ash, and rock fragments, that originate from the slopes of volcanoes.
2.  The internal heat of lahars is primarily maintained by the exothermic reactions between the volcanic materials and atmospheric oxygen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Lahars are indeed rapid flows of volcanic debris, a mixture of water, ash, and rock fragments, originating from volcanic slopes.  These devastating flows can occur during eruptions or even after, triggered by factors like heavy rainfall interacting with loose volcanic material or the sudden melting of glaciers or snow near the volcano. Their speed and destructive power are significant environmental hazards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While chemical reactions within the volcanic material contribute to some heat generation, the primary reason for a lahar's high temperature is not exothermic reactions with atmospheric oxygen. The heat is largely derived from the inherent heat of the volcanic material itself, which is still hot from the volcanic activity, and the frictional heat generated by the rapid movement of the debris flow. The interaction with atmospheric oxygen plays a secondary role, if any, in maintaining the lahar's temperature.  The significant heat comes from the source material and the kinetic energy of the flow itself.


**2. With reference to the PREFIRE mission, consider the following statements:**

1. PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) is a NASA mission aimed at measuring the amount of heat radiated from the Earth's surface into space.
2.  The mission utilizes a single climate satellite to collect data from both the Arctic and Antarctic regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PREFIRE mission's primary goal is to measure the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), essentially the heat radiated from the Earth's surface and atmosphere into space, with a particular focus on the polar regions. This data is crucial for understanding the Earth's heat budget and climate change dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PREFIRE mission, while focusing on polar regions, does not use a single satellite.  The provided text mentions NASA launching *one* of *two* climate satellites as part of the mission.  Therefore, the mission employs a constellation of at least two satellites to enhance data coverage and accuracy across the extensive Arctic and Antarctic regions. The use of multiple satellites is essential for comprehensive data acquisition in such vast and remote areas.


**3. With reference to the Kallakkadal phenomenon, consider the following statements:**

1. Kallakkadal is a type of coastal flooding that primarily occurs during the monsoon season along the southwest coast of India.
2. The phenomenon is caused by high-amplitude storm surges generated by local weather systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Kallakkadal does involve coastal flooding along India's southwest coast, it's not limited to the monsoon season.  The text explicitly states that it usually occurs in the pre-monsoon (April-May) or post-monsoon seasons.  The timing is crucial, distinguishing it from monsoon-related flooding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kallakkadal is not caused by storm surges generated by *local* weather systems.  Instead, it is driven by swell waves originating from distant weather storms, such as hurricanes, that travel thousands of miles across oceans. These swell waves can propagate in directions different from the wind's direction, reaching the coast and causing significant coastal flooding.  The source of the waves is the key differentiating factor.


**4. With reference to the impact of red tides, consider the following statements:**

1. Red tides are caused by the excessive growth of harmful algae that produce toxins, resulting in the discoloration of coastal waters.
2. The phenomenon is always fatal to marine life, leading to mass mortality events.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Red tides are indeed caused by algal blooms (often dinoflagellates), which release toxins that can discolor the water, often reddish-brown. These blooms can significantly impact marine life and even human health through shellfish contamination.  The causative agent and the resulting water discoloration are key features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While red tides can cause significant harm to marine life, leading to mortality events, it's not always fatal. The severity of the impact depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of toxins produced by the algae, the species affected, and the duration of the bloom. Some marine organisms may be more resistant than others, and some blooms might not produce lethal toxins.  Therefore, stating it's *always* fatal is an oversimplification.



**5. With reference to Gape Limitation in ecology, consider the following statements:**

1. Gape limitation refers to the constraint on the size of prey that a predator can consume, primarily determined by the predator's body size.
2.  Gape limitation plays a significant role in shaping food webs and regulating predator-prey dynamics, but has little influence on species adaptations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Gape limitation is the ecological concept describing how a predator's mouth size (or gape) restricts the maximum size of prey it can consume. This size constraint directly affects the predator's diet and foraging strategy. The mouth size is the primary determinant, not necessarily the overall body size, although there is a correlation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Gape limitation is a crucial factor in shaping food webs, regulating predator-prey balances, and influencing species adaptations.  The size constraint directly drives evolutionary adaptations in both predators (e.g., development of larger mouths or specialized hunting techniques) and prey (e.g., evolution of defensive mechanisms or smaller body sizes).  Ignoring its role in adaptation is a significant oversight.  Gape limitation profoundly impacts ecological dynamics and evolutionary processes.


**6. With reference to Megafauna, consider the following statements:**

1. Megafauna are defined as animals weighing less than 50 kg, playing a crucial role in seed dispersal and nutrient cycling.
2.  Extinction of megafauna species, particularly megaherbivores, has significantly impacted ecosystem functioning since the Late Pleistocene.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition of megafauna is animals weighing *above* a certain threshold (generally above 50 kg), not below.  Their large size often leads to significant roles in ecosystem processes like seed dispersal and nutrient cycling, but the weight threshold is incorrectly stated.

Statement 2 is correct. The extinction of megafauna, particularly megaherbivores and megacarnivores, since the Late Pleistocene has had profound impacts on ecosystem functioning.  These extinctions caused disruptions in nutrient cycles, vegetation dynamics, and overall biodiversity, with cascading effects on numerous other species. The loss of these keystone species has altered ecosystems globally.


**7. With reference to Stromatolites, consider the following statements:**

1. Stromatolites are primarily formed by the activity of photosynthetic bacteria and are found only in deep-ocean environments.
2.  The formation of stromatolites played a significant role in the Great Oxidation Event, but their contribution to modern oxygen production is negligible.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While stromatolites are formed by microbial communities, including photosynthetic cyanobacteria, they are not exclusively found in deep-ocean environments.  They can be found in various environments, including shallow marine settings, as indicated by the recent discovery of living shallow-marine stromatolites near the Red Sea. The location specification is too restrictive.

Statement 2 is correct. Stromatolites played a crucial role in the Great Oxidation Event, contributing significantly to the rise of atmospheric oxygen billions of years ago. However, their contribution to modern oxygen production is relatively minor compared to other photosynthetic organisms like plants and algae. Their historical impact is far greater than their present-day influence.


**8. With reference to Environmental DNA (eDNA), consider the following statements:**

1. eDNA analysis is a relatively new technique used to detect the presence of species in an ecosystem, but it is less reliable and more expensive than traditional methods.
2.  eDNA data can be used to supplement information for conservation tools, such as the IUCN Red List.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. eDNA analysis is a powerful tool for detecting species presence, offering advantages over traditional methods.  It's described in the text as reliable and accurate, and cost-effective.  The statement misrepresents the reliability and cost-effectiveness of eDNA.

Statement 2 is correct.  eDNA data is increasingly used to enhance conservation efforts. The information gathered through eDNA analysis can be valuable in updating and improving the IUCN Red List and other conservation tools by providing a more comprehensive understanding of species distribution, abundance, and conservation status.  This application is a significant contribution to conservation science.


**9. With reference to the modes of Speciation, consider the following statements:**

1. Allopatric speciation occurs when new species are formed from geographically separated populations, while sympatric speciation occurs when new species arise from geographically overlapping populations without geographical barriers.
2.  Peripatric speciation is a type of allopatric speciation where a small population becomes isolated at the edge of a larger population's range, leading to the formation of a new species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definitions of allopatric and sympatric speciation are accurate. Allopatric speciation involves geographic isolation driving divergence, whereas sympatric speciation occurs within the same geographic area due to other isolating mechanisms.  The distinction between geographic isolation and its absence is the key to understanding these modes.

Statement 2 is also correct. Peripatric speciation is a specific type of allopatric speciation, characterized by the isolation of a small peripheral population from the main population. This isolation can lead to genetic divergence and the formation of a new species.  The relationship between peripatric and allopatric speciation is correctly described.


**10. With reference to Bioluminescence, consider the following statements:**

1. Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms, typically involving the oxidation of luciferin in the presence of luciferase or a photoprotein.
2. Bioluminescence is exclusively used for attracting prey and defense against predators, with no other ecological functions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of bioluminescence is accurate.  It involves chemical reactions, typically the oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by luciferase or a photoprotein, resulting in light emission. This process is found in various organisms across different taxa. The chemical basis and the process are accurately portrayed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While attracting prey and deterring predators are common uses of bioluminescence, it serves various other ecological functions.  These include counter-illumination (camouflage), communication, and mate attraction.  Limiting its functions to only predation and defense is an oversimplification.  The diverse roles of bioluminescence in various ecosystems are not fully captured in the statement.


**11. With reference to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sendai Framework was adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015 and aims to substantially reduce disaster risks and losses.
2.  The framework prioritizes understanding disaster risk, strengthening governance, investing in risk reduction, and enhancing preparedness, but it does not address recovery and reconstruction efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) was indeed adopted in Sendai, Japan, in 2015, as the successor to the Hyogo Framework for Action.  Its core goal is to significantly reduce disaster-related risks and losses across various sectors.  The adoption details and the overarching aim are accurately presented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sendai Framework explicitly addresses recovery and reconstruction efforts as a crucial component of disaster risk reduction.  The "Build Back Better" principle is central to the framework, emphasizing the importance of rebuilding in a more resilient manner to minimize future risks.  Omitting this aspect misrepresents the framework's comprehensive approach.


**12. With reference to Marine Heatwaves (MHWs), consider the following statements:**

1. MHWs are defined as periods when seawater temperatures exceed a seasonally varying threshold for at least five consecutive days, and they can last for extended periods.
2.  The increasing frequency and intensity of MHWs are primarily attributed to natural climate variability, with minimal influence from human activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definition of MHWs is accurately presented.  The threshold exceeding, the duration requirement (five consecutive days), and the potential for extended duration are all key characteristics.  The definition is precise and reflects the scientific understanding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While natural climate variability plays a role, the increasing frequency and intensity of MHWs are strongly linked to anthropogenic climate change.  The rapid warming of oceans, particularly the Indian Ocean, and events like strong El Niño episodes, exacerbated by human-induced climate change, significantly contribute to the rise in MHWs.  Attributing the increase solely to natural variability ignores the significant influence of human activities.


**13. With reference to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) weather forecasting capabilities, consider the following statements:**

1. The IMD currently has the capability to provide hyper-local weather forecasts with 1 km x 1 km grid resolution, significantly improving the accuracy of localized predictions.
2.  Initiatives like the CoS-it-FloWS project utilize community-sourced data to supplement government data, enhancing flood forecasting accuracy in specific river basins.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IMD is aiming for hyper-local forecasts with 1 km x 1 km grid resolution, the text explicitly states that their current capability is 12 km x 12 km grid resolution.  The statement incorrectly claims the achievement of the higher resolution.  The aspiration and the current reality are different.

Statement 2 is correct. The CoS-it-FloWS project is a prime example of how community participation and crowdsourced data can enhance flood forecasting, particularly in areas with data gaps.  The project leverages community involvement to improve the accuracy of hyper-local predictions, demonstrating the potential of community-based initiatives.  The project's role and the methodology are accurately described.


**14. With reference to the Drought Early Warning System (DEWS), consider the following statements:**

1. DEWS data indicated that over 50% of India's land area experienced varying degrees of drought in September 2023.
2.  DEWS is a comprehensive system providing real-time drought monitoring and forecasting, but it does not include any early warning mechanisms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that 30% of India's land area experienced drought in September 2023 according to DEWS data, not over 50%.  The percentage is significantly misrepresented.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  DEWS, by its very name (Drought Early Warning System), is designed to provide early warnings about potential droughts.  The system's purpose is to monitor and forecast drought conditions, allowing for proactive measures to mitigate its impacts.  The statement mistakenly claims the absence of an early warning component.


**15. With reference to the Lesser Florican conservation project, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lesser Florican conservation project primarily focuses on habitat restoration, with minimal emphasis on captive breeding or research initiatives.
2.  The Wildlife Institute of India is the primary implementing agency, collaborating with various national and international organizations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The establishment of a UN panel to address the sustainable management of CETMs reflects the international recognition of their importance for the energy transition and the need for responsible sourcing practices to minimize environmental and social risks. The panel's purpose and the reason for its creation are accurately presented.



**1. With reference to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Stockholm Convention, adopted in 2001 and ratified by India in 2006, mandates the complete elimination of all POPs globally by 2030.
2.  PFAS, due to their similar properties to DDT, are now being detected at high levels, replacing DDT as a major environmental concern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Stockholm Convention aims to reduce and eliminate POPs, it doesn't set a specific deadline of 2030 for complete global elimination. The convention operates through a phased approach, with different timelines and regulations for various POPs based on their toxicity and usage patterns.  The process involves identifying, monitoring, and controlling POPs, with a long-term goal of minimizing their environmental impact.  Complete elimination is a long-term aspiration rather than a specific target date.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the decrease in DDT use has led to a rise in replacement POPs, such as PFAS, with similar properties.  These replacement chemicals are now detected at high levels, indicating a shift in the environmental burden from DDT to other persistent pollutants. This highlights the complex and evolving nature of POP pollution, where the control of one pollutant can sometimes lead to the rise of others.  The persistent nature of these substances and the challenges in their complete eradication are key factors in the ongoing environmental concerns related to POPs.


**2. With reference to the impacts of soil acidification, consider the following statements:**

1.  Soil acidification primarily leads to an increase in soil fertility and improved nutrient availability for plants.
2.  The loss of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and increased aluminum toxicity are significant consequences of soil acidification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Soil acidification does not increase soil fertility. In fact, it has the opposite effect.  Decreased soil pH reduces the availability of essential nutrients like phosphorus, potassium, and calcium, making them less accessible to plants.  Furthermore, increased acidity can lead to the release of toxic metals like aluminum, which can harm plant roots and hinder growth.  Therefore, soil acidification significantly reduces soil fertility and negatively impacts plant health.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly lists the loss of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and increased aluminum toxicity as significant consequences of soil acidification. The reduction in SIC contributes to carbon loss from the soil, impacting its structure and overall health. The increased aluminum toxicity is directly related to the lower pH, making aluminum more soluble and thus more readily available to plants, where it can be toxic.  These points highlight the detrimental effects of soil acidification on soil health and ecosystem function.


**3. With reference to the Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CCD is the water depth where the rate of calcium carbonate production by marine organisms exceeds the rate of its dissolution.
2.  An expanding CCD indicates increased ocean acidification due to rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCD is defined as the depth where the rate of supply of calcium carbonate *equals* the rate of its dissolution.  At depths shallower than the CCD, the rate of supply exceeds the rate of dissolution, leading to the accumulation of calcium carbonate sediments.  Below the CCD, the rate of dissolution exceeds the rate of supply, resulting in the absence of calcium carbonate in sediments.  The statement reverses this crucial relationship.

Statement 2 is correct.  The expansion of the CCD is a direct consequence of increased ocean acidification.  Rising atmospheric CO2 levels lead to higher CO2 absorption by the oceans, decreasing the pH of seawater and making it more acidic. This increased acidity enhances the dissolution rate of calcium carbonate, causing the CCD to shift to shallower depths, thereby reducing the amount of calcium carbonate that can accumulate in deep-sea sediments. This is a significant indicator of the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.


**4. With reference to the effects of mercury pollution, consider the following statements:**

1. Mercury is a naturally occurring element found primarily in the atmosphere, with minimal presence in water and soil.
2. Minamata disease, a chronic neurological disorder, is caused by methylmercury, a toxic form of mercury that bioaccumulates in the food chain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While mercury is a naturally occurring element, it's found in air, water, and soil.  The text explicitly states its presence in all three environmental compartments. The statement misrepresents the distribution of mercury in the environment, underestimating its presence in water and soil.  The widespread distribution of mercury necessitates comprehensive strategies for pollution control.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly explains that Minamata disease is a chronic neurological disorder caused by methylmercury.  Methylmercury is a highly toxic form of mercury that bioaccumulates in aquatic organisms and enters the food chain, posing significant risks to human health through the consumption of contaminated seafood.  The description accurately reflects the causation and mechanism of Minamata disease, highlighting the serious health consequences of mercury pollution.


**5.  With reference to  bioplastics, consider the following statements:**

1. Bioplastics are entirely derived from petroleum-based sources, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics.
2.  Bioplastics are biodegradable and decompose completely, leaving no harmful residue in the environment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bioplastics are produced from renewable resources, not petroleum. The text explicitly states that bioplastics are "bio-based polymers produced from renewable resources including carbohydrates, vegetable oils, etc."  The use of renewable resources is a key aspect of their sustainability compared to traditional plastics.

2. The mangrove ecosystems of South India were categorized as "Vulnerable" according to the IUCN Red List assessment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IUCN Red List assessment covered 36 regions across 44 countries. While this represents a significant number of regions, it is less than half of the world's coastal regions where mangroves are found.  The assessment highlights the need for a more comprehensive global evaluation of mangrove health and conservation status.  A complete understanding of the threats requires broader coverage and data collection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the mangrove ecosystems of South India were identified as critically endangered, not vulnerable. This distinction is vital as "critically endangered" signifies a far greater risk of extinction. The categorization reflects the severity of the threats facing these ecosystems and the urgent need for conservation efforts.  The higher risk category necessitates more aggressive and immediate conservation actions.


**5. With reference to India's mangrove conservation initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The MISHTI initiative focuses solely on increasing the income of coastal communities through mangrove-based aquaculture.
2. The "Magical Mangroves" campaign is a collaborative effort between the Indian government and international organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes) initiative, while aiming to improve the livelihoods of coastal communities, has a broader scope than just mangrove-based aquaculture. It encompasses habitat restoration and sustainable income generation through various means related to mangrove ecosystems.  The focus is on integrated approaches to conservation and sustainable development.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The "Magical Mangroves" campaign is primarily led by WWF India and involves citizen participation in nine coastal states.  While it may have collaborations, it is not a direct collaboration between the Indian government and international organizations in the same way as some other mangrove conservation programs.  The citizen-focused approach emphasizes community engagement in conservation efforts.


**6. With reference to the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI), consider the following statements:**

1.  FERI is a UN-led initiative implemented solely by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
2. The primary goal of FERI is to promote the sustainable use of forest resources while ensuring biodiversity conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FERI is a partnership between the Korea Forest Service (KFS) and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), not solely a UN initiative implemented by UNEP.  The involvement of KFS highlights the importance of international collaboration and knowledge sharing in forest ecosystem restoration.  The partnership leverages the expertise and resources of different organizations to achieve common goals.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While FERI promotes sustainable forest management, its primary goal is broader than just sustainable use; it focuses on the restoration of degraded forest ecosystems.  This encompasses a wide range of activities aimed at improving forest health, biodiversity, and ecological function.  The emphasis is on restoring the ecological integrity of forest landscapes, which is essential for long-term sustainability.


**7. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), consider the following statements:**

1. ESZs are primarily established to prohibit all human activities within designated areas to ensure complete environmental protection.
2.  The ESZ guidelines classify activities into only two categories: permitted and prohibited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ESZs are not designed to completely prohibit all human activities. The purpose is to regulate activities to minimize environmental impact, not to entirely exclude human presence.  The aim is to create a balance between conservation and sustainable development.  The regulations vary depending on the specific sensitivity of the area and the types of activities involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ESZ guidelines categorize activities into three categories: prohibited, regulated, and permitted. This tiered approach allows for a more nuanced management of activities within ESZs, allowing for some activities that are compatible with environmental protection while strictly prohibiting those that pose significant threats.  The three-tier system allows for flexibility and adaptation to local contexts.


**8. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats mountain range stretches across seven states of India.
2. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) recommended designating the entire Western Ghats region as a "Protected Area".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Western Ghats cover six states, not seven. While the exact boundaries can be complex, the core information provided indicates six states are encompassed by the mountain range.  Precision in geographical information is crucial in environmental studies.  The number of states involved influences policy and planning for conservation efforts.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The WGEEP (Madhav Gadgil Committee) recommended designating a significant portion of the Western Ghats as an "Ecologically Sensitive Area" (ESA), not a "Protected Area". The distinction is important because ESAs allow for a range of human activities under regulation, while a "Protected Area" typically implies stricter restrictions.  Understanding the difference in designations is key to understanding the nuances of conservation policy.


**9. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA framework is primarily concerned with measuring the economic value of natural resources without considering their ecological impact.
2. EnviStats India 2024, based on the SEEA framework, indicates a significant decrease in India's total protected area during the period 2000-2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEA framework is designed to measure the interaction between the economy and the environment.  It considers both the economic value and the ecological impact of natural resources.  A holistic approach is essential for sustainable resource management.  The framework aims to integrate environmental considerations into economic decision-making.

Statement 2 is incorrect. EnviStats India 2024, according to the text, shows a significant *increase* (around 72% increase in number and 16% increase in area) in India's total protected area between 2000 and 2023, not a decrease.  This data reflects India's efforts in expanding its network of protected areas for biodiversity conservation.  The increase indicates a positive trend in conservation efforts.  Accuracy in data interpretation is critical in environmental assessments.


**10. With reference to the People's Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PBR is a voluntary initiative with no statutory backing, relying solely on the participation of local communities.
2.  The primary purpose of the PBR is to document traditional medicinal uses of local biological resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PBR has statutory recognition under the Biological Diversity Act (2002).  It is mandated to be prepared by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in consultation with local people. The legal backing ensures its validity and importance in biodiversity conservation and governance.  The statutory framework provides a mechanism for the implementation and enforcement of the PBR initiative.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While documenting traditional medicinal uses is a significant component of the PBR, its purpose is broader than that.  It aims to document and safeguard all aspects of local bioresources and associated knowledge, including their cultural significance, economic uses, and ecological roles. The comprehensive approach ensures a holistic understanding of the relationship between people and their environment.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Plankton blooms, characterized by a rapid increase in plankton populations, are primarily caused by an abundance of nutrients and sufficient carbon dioxide in the water.
2.  Gape limitation, a concept in ecology, refers to the physical restriction on the size of prey a predator can consume, primarily determined by the predator's mouth size.  Smaller predators are thus limited to smaller prey.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes gape limitation, a fundamental ecological concept explaining predator-prey relationships based on the physical constraints of the predator's mouth size.  This limitation directly influences food web structure, species adaptations, and predator-prey dynamics.  The statement correctly highlights that smaller predators are restricted to consuming smaller prey items.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While nutrient availability is crucial for plankton blooms, the statement oversimplifies the process.  Plankton crashes can occur due to nutrient depletion *or* excessive nutrient levels leading to eutrophication and subsequent oxygen depletion.  Furthermore, a lack of CO2, while potentially limiting photosynthesis in some cases, is not the primary driver of plankton crashes.  Other factors such as changes in water quality, temperature fluctuations, grazing pressure from zooplankton, and viral infections significantly influence plankton population dynamics.  The statement omits these crucial factors, making it an incomplete and ultimately inaccurate description of plankton bloom dynamics.


**2. With reference to Megafauna, consider the following statements:**

1.  Megafauna, by definition, encompasses all animals weighing over 40 kg, irrespective of their dietary habits.
2.  Extinction events impacting megafauna, particularly megaherbivores and megacarnivores, have been significantly influenced by human activities since the Late Pleistocene epoch.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly identifies the significant impact of anthropogenic pressures on megafauna populations since the Late Pleistocene.  Human activities, including hunting, habitat destruction, and climate change, have driven numerous megafauna extinctions and population declines.  The statement accurately highlights the vulnerability of megaherbivores and megacarnivores to these pressures.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The weight threshold for classifying an animal as megafauna is generally considered to be above 50 kg, not 40 kg.  While there might be some variation in the exact weight threshold used in different studies, the 50kg mark is a widely accepted standard.  The statement's inaccuracy regarding the weight threshold makes it factually incorrect.


**3. With reference to Stromatolites, consider the following statements:**

1.  Stromatolites, primarily formed by cyanobacteria, are exclusively found in deep-sea environments due to their sensitivity to sunlight.
2.  The recent discovery of living shallow-marine stromatolites near the Red Sea provides evidence of their adaptability to a wider range of environments than previously assumed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the significance of the recent discovery of living shallow-marine stromatolites near the Red Sea.  This finding challenges the earlier understanding of stromatolites being confined to extreme environments and highlights their capacity to thrive in shallower, more accessible marine habitats. The discovery expands our understanding of their ecological distribution and resilience.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While stromatolites are often found in extreme environments,  their formation is not exclusively linked to deep-sea habitats.  They are microbial communities that build layered structures, and although some thrive in extreme conditions,  they can also be found in shallower waters.  The statement incorrectly confines their habitat to deep-sea environments and misrepresents their relationship with sunlight (many stromatolite-forming organisms are photosynthetic and thus require sunlight).


**4. With reference to Environmental DNA (eDNA), consider the following statements:**

1.  eDNA analysis is a costly and time-consuming method for assessing biodiversity, requiring extensive laboratory resources and specialized expertise.
2.  eDNA, collected from environmental samples, can be used to detect the presence of species and inform conservation efforts, including the IUCN Red List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly describes the application of eDNA in biodiversity assessment and conservation. eDNA analysis offers a powerful and increasingly affordable tool to detect the presence of species in an ecosystem, even those that are difficult to observe directly. The information gathered can significantly contribute to conservation efforts, including updating the IUCN Red List and informing conservation strategies.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While eDNA analysis did initially require specialized equipment and expertise, making it more expensive than some traditional methods, advancements in technology have made it significantly more affordable and accessible. The statement misrepresents the current cost-effectiveness and accessibility of eDNA analysis as a tool for biodiversity assessment.


**5. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Bioluminescence is the emission of light by living organisms, primarily achieved through chemical reactions involving luciferin and luciferase, and always resulting in blue light emission.
2.  Organisms exhibiting bioluminescence include a diverse range of species, from bacteria and fungi to various marine invertebrates and fish.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the broad diversity of organisms capable of bioluminescence.  The phenomenon is found across various taxa, including bacteria, fungi, invertebrates (like jellyfish and fireflies), and fish, showcasing its evolutionary success in diverse ecological niches.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While bioluminescence does involve luciferin and often luciferase (or photoprotein), the statement's assertion that it *always* results in blue light emission is false. The spectral range of light emitted by bioluminescent organisms varies, spanning from blue to red, depending on the specific chemicals and organisms involved.  The statement's oversimplification and inaccurate limitation of the emitted light color makes it incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Global Financial mechanisms under UNFCCC, consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), established in 2010, aimed to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020 from developed countries to support developing nations in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The Adaptation Fund, established in 2001, receives a 20% share of proceeds from the new market-based UNFCCC mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was indeed established during COP 16 in 2010 with the ambitious goal of mobilizing US$100 billion per year by 2020 from developed countries to assist developing countries in meeting their NDCs.  While this target was not fully met, the GCF remains a crucial mechanism for climate finance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Adaptation Fund receives only a 5% share, not 20%, of the proceeds from the new market-based mechanism established under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. This discrepancy highlights the importance of carefully understanding the specific financial arrangements within the UNFCCC framework. The 5% allocation reflects the commitment to channel a portion of the proceeds from market mechanisms towards adaptation efforts in developing countries.  The incorrect figure in statement 2 serves as a significant distractor, testing the examinee's precise knowledge of the financial percentages involved.


**2. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats extend for approximately 1,200 km along India's west coast, from the river Tapi in the north to Kanyakumari in the south.
2.  The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan recommended a three-zone classification for the Western Ghats' Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), based on varying degrees of sensitivity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Western Ghats are actually approximately 1,600 km long, not 1,200 km. This seemingly minor difference tests the candidate's precise knowledge of geographical details.  The accurate length is a crucial piece of information demonstrating a deeper understanding of the region's scale and significance.

Statement 2 is correct. The HLWG, chaired by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, did indeed propose a three-zone classification for the Western Ghats ESZs, categorized as ESZ1 (very high sensitivity), ESZ2 (high sensitivity), and ESZ3 (moderate sensitivity). This highlights the committee's approach to differentiated environmental management based on varying levels of ecological sensitivity within the region.  The accurate description of the three-zone system and the name of the committee chair acts as a strong test of factual recall.


**3. With reference to the  Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) report, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPI report, "Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2024," indicated that climate finance flows likely exceeded USD 1.8 trillion in 2023, with significant increases in renewable energy and low-carbon transport.
2. The CPI report found that investment in fossil fuels and consumer fossil fuel subsidies have decreased annually since 2020.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The CPI report did indicate that climate finance flows likely surpassed USD 1.5 trillion in 2023, with notable growth in renewable energy and low-carbon transport. The slight inflation of the figure to USD 1.8 trillion serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between a broadly accurate statement and a precisely accurate one. The key takeaway is the substantial increase in climate finance, particularly in green sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CPI report actually highlighted that fossil fuel investment and consumer fossil fuel subsidies *continued to increase* annually since 2020. This directly contradicts the statement, showcasing a critical difference that needs to be picked up by the examinee. This contrast emphasizes the persistent challenge of transitioning away from fossil fuels despite growing climate finance in renewable energy.  The reversal of the trend in statement 2 is a major distractor.


**4. With reference to the  Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Atlas revealed a decrease in Kharif and Rabi cropland over the past 17 years, accompanied by an increase in fallow land.
2. The Atlas shows a decrease in built-up land since 2005, indicating a slowdown in urbanization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Atlas actually showed an *expansion* of Kharif and Rabi cropland and a *reduction* in fallow land over the past 17 years.  This reversal of the trend in statement 1 is a key distractor, testing precise knowledge of the data presented in the Atlas.  The information regarding the changes in cropland and fallow land is crucial for understanding agricultural land use dynamics in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atlas demonstrated an *increase* in built-up land since 2005, reflecting ongoing urbanization. The opposite trend presented in statement 2 acts as a significant distractor, requiring candidates to have a clear understanding of the urbanization patterns revealed by the Atlas. The data on built-up land is vital for analyzing India's urban development and its environmental implications.


**5. With reference to the  European Union's Nature Restoration Plan (NRP), consider the following statements:**

1. The NRP aims to restore at least 15% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems needing restoration by 2050.
2. The NRP includes binding restoration targets for forests, wetlands, and grasslands, but excludes pollinating insects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRP's ambitious goal is to restore at least *20%*, not 15%, of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030, with the aim of restoring all ecosystems in need by 2050. The difference between 15% and 20% is a critical detail that tests the candidate's precise understanding of the plan's targets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRP explicitly includes binding restoration targets not only for forests, wetlands, and grasslands, but also for *pollinating insects*.  The exclusion of pollinating insects in statement 2 is a key distractor designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the plan's scope and focus. The inclusion of pollinating insects reflects the plan's holistic approach to ecosystem restoration.


**6. With reference to the  Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. EW4All aims to provide early warning systems (EWS) for all people against hazardous weather events by the end of 2025.
2. EW4All is spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EW4All initiative aims to provide EWS for all people by the end of *2027*, not 2025.  The two-year difference is a significant detail that tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the initiative's timeline. The timeframe is crucial for understanding the initiative's urgency and implementation strategy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction is indeed involved, EW4All is spearheaded by the *World Meteorological Organization (WMO)*, not the WHO.  The substitution of WMO with WHO is a key distractor, requiring candidates to have a clear understanding of the organizations leading the initiative.  The correct identification of the lead organization is essential for understanding the technical expertise driving the initiative.


**1. With reference to the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. IDWH solely focuses on strengthening protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
2. The Species Recovery Program under IDWH has identified and is actively working on over 30 critically endangered species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IDWH does provide support to protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves), its scope extends beyond this.  It also encompasses the crucial aspect of wildlife protection *outside* protected areas, recognizing that conservation efforts cannot be limited to designated zones.  The scheme aims for a holistic approach to wildlife conservation, acknowledging the interconnectedness of habitats.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that 22 species have been identified under the Species Recovery Program so far. The claim of over 30 species is inaccurate and misrepresents the current status of the program.  It's important to note that the number of species under the program might increase over time, but the statement presents an inflated figure.


**2. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. PBRs are prepared by the state governments and are legally binding on local communities.
2. The primary purpose of a PBR is to generate revenue from the commercial exploitation of local bioresources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PBRs do have statutory recognition under the Biological Diversity Act (2002), they are prepared by the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in consultation with local people, not solely by state governments.  The BMCs are local-level bodies, ensuring community participation in the documentation process.  The legal binding aspect is also misleading; PBRs primarily serve as a documentation tool supporting local ownership claims, not as direct legal instruments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The main objective of a PBR is to document and safeguard bioresources and associated traditional knowledge, not to generate revenue through commercial exploitation.  The focus is on sustainable resource management and recognizing the rights of local communities over their biodiversity.  While the information in a PBR *could* indirectly contribute to sustainable economic activities, direct revenue generation is not its primary purpose.


**3. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The EPI 2024 ranks countries based on a single, comprehensive indicator of overall environmental performance.
2. India's ranking in the EPI 2024 reflects a significant improvement compared to its performance in previous years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EPI 2024 utilizes 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories to arrive at its rankings.  It's not based on a single indicator but rather a multifaceted assessment covering climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. This holistic approach makes the index more comprehensive than a single-metric assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that India was ranked 176th out of 180 countries in the EPI 2024.  This ranking doesn't suggest an improvement; rather, it indicates a relatively low performance compared to other nations. While precise comparisons with previous years' rankings are not directly provided, the extremely low ranking suggests no significant improvement.


**4. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NCI 2024 uses a single, universally accepted metric for assessing nature conservation efforts across all countries.
2.  India's relatively low ranking in the NCI 2024 is primarily attributed to its high population density.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage does not provide details about the specific metrics used by the NCI 2024,  implying that there isn't a single, universally accepted metric used for all countries.  Different indices might employ different methodologies and weighting systems, making direct comparisons complex.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's high population density could indirectly contribute to environmental pressures, the NCI 2024 ranking doesn't explicitly attribute the low ranking to population density alone.  The index likely considers a range of factors impacting nature conservation, including policy, resource allocation, and environmental degradation, not solely population density.  The statement oversimplifies the complex factors determining a country's NCI ranking.


**5. With reference to environmental DNA (eDNA), consider the following statements:**

1. eDNA analysis is a costly and time-consuming method for biodiversity assessment, making it unsuitable for large-scale studies.
2. eDNA primarily focuses on the analysis of DNA from plant species and does not provide insights into animal biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly highlights that the eDNA approach is reliable, accurate, and can be done at a low cost.  This contrasts sharply with the statement's assertion of high cost and time consumption. The cost-effectiveness and efficiency of eDNA are key advantages making it suitable for large-scale biodiversity assessments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that eDNA is used to detect the presence of species and assess biodiversity in an ecosystem, encompassing both aquatic and terrestrial environments.  This implies that it's applicable to both plant and animal species, providing insights into the overall biodiversity of a given area.  The statement wrongly restricts the application of eDNA to only plant species.


**6. With reference to the modes of speciation, consider the following statements:**

1. Allopatric speciation occurs when populations are geographically separated, leading to reproductive isolation.
2. Sympatric speciation requires geographic isolation as a prerequisite for the formation of new species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Allopatric speciation is precisely defined by the geographic separation of populations, leading to independent evolutionary trajectories and ultimately, reproductive isolation.  This isolation prevents gene flow, allowing distinct genetic differences to accumulate, eventually resulting in the formation of new species.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sympatric speciation, unlike allopatric speciation, *does not* require geographic isolation.  New species can arise within the same geographic area through mechanisms such as reproductive isolation due to different mating preferences or ecological specialization, even without physical barriers separating populations. The example of Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers coexisting in the subcontinent due to sympatric speciation directly refutes the statement.


**7. With reference to bioluminescence, consider the following statements:**

1. Bioluminescence is the ability of an organism to produce light through chemical reactions involving only one unique chemical.
2. Bioluminescence is exhibited only by marine organisms and is not observed in terrestrial ecosystems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that bioluminescence requires *two* unique chemicals: luciferin and either luciferase or photoprotein.  The statement wrongly simplifies the chemical process involved, omitting a crucial component.  The two chemicals are essential for the energy release and light production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage lists several examples of bioluminescent organisms, including fireflies and fungi, which are terrestrial.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion that bioluminescence is limited to marine environments.  Bioluminescence has evolved independently in various lineages across diverse ecosystems.


**8. With reference to the People's Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PBR is a legally mandated document prepared exclusively by government officials.
2. The information documented in a PBR solely focuses on the economic value of local biological resources.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Biological Diversity Act (2002) provides the legal framework for PBRs, they are prepared by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in consultation with local communities, not exclusively by government officials.  The community involvement is a crucial aspect of the PBR process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A PBR documents a wider range of information than just the economic value of biological resources. It includes details about the availability and knowledge of local biological resources, their medicinal or other uses, and any associated traditional knowledge.  The holistic approach aims to conserve both the biological resources and the cultural heritage associated with them.


**9.  With reference to the Ramsar sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All Ramsar sites in India are located in natural wetlands, untouched by human intervention.
2. The recent addition of new wetlands to the Ramsar list has significantly reduced the number of wetlands in India that are classified as threatened.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The examples of Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries, which are man-made reservoirs, demonstrate that Ramsar sites are not exclusively located in pristine, untouched natural wetlands. Human intervention, whether through construction or other means, doesn't automatically disqualify a wetland from Ramsar designation if it meets other criteria for ecological significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage only mentions the *addition* of new sites to the Ramsar list, not a reduction in the number of threatened wetlands.  The addition of new sites reflects an effort toward conservation, but it doesn't automatically imply a decrease in the overall number of threatened wetlands in India. The number of threatened wetlands might still be high despite the additions to the Ramsar list.


**10. With reference to the IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems, consider the following statements:**

1. The IUCN Red List assessment of mangrove ecosystems focuses solely on the mangrove forests in South Asia.
2. The assessment confirms that the majority of mangrove ecosystems globally are classified as healthy and thriving.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The assessment covered 36 regions across 44 countries, clearly indicating a global scope and not a regional focus on South Asia alone. The assessment aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the status of mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that about 50% of the ecosystems examined were classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of the majority of ecosystems being healthy. The alarmingly high percentage of threatened ecosystems highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts.


**11. With reference to the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC), consider the following statements:**

1. The SFTLC is a government-led initiative solely focused on securing funding for tiger conservation within protected areas.
2. The Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC) is a governmental body responsible for implementing the financial strategies outlined by the SFTLC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the SFTLC aims to increase support for tiger protection, its scope is not limited to funding within protected areas. It seeks to leverage new financial strategies and global partnerships to address tiger conservation holistically, encompassing broader landscapes and involving various stakeholders.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly identifies the TCC as an *independent* group of organizations, not a governmental body.  It collaborates with various entities to achieve tiger conservation goals but doesn't have the direct implementation responsibility for the financial strategies developed by the SFTLC.  The TCC plays a supportive rather than a leading implementation role.


**12. With reference to the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IBCA focuses exclusively on the conservation of tigers and does not involve other big cat species.
2. The IBCA is funded entirely by the government of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that the IBCA is a multi-country and multi-agency coalition focused on the conservation of *all* big cat species.  It's not limited to tigers but aims to address the conservation challenges of a broader range of big cats globally.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions Indian funding (Rs. 150 crores), it also states that the IBCA is a multi-country and multi-agency coalition. This implies that funding comes from multiple sources, not solely from the Indian government.  International participation and collaboration suggest a broader funding base.


**13. With reference to the Elephant Census 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Elephant Census 2023 covered all states in India and provided a comprehensive national-level population assessment.
2. The high death rate among juvenile elephants is solely attributed to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The census focused on the southern states of India, making it a regional assessment, not a comprehensive national-level assessment.  The passage does not provide information about the inclusion of other states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict can contribute to elephant mortality, the passage specifically attributes a significant portion (40%) of the high death rate among juvenile elephants to Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesviruses (EEHVs).  The statement wrongly omits this crucial factor in elephant mortality.


**14. With reference to the State of the Rhino 2024 Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicates a steady decline in the global rhino population across all five species.
2. The report highlights a significant increase in rhino poaching in Africa during 2023 compared to 2022.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report shows that while the overall number of rhinos is under 28,000, it also notes an *increase* in the white rhino population.  This contradicts the statement's claim of a steady decline across all five species. The situation is mixed, with some species showing population growth while others face challenges.

Statement 2 is correct. The report explicitly mentions a 4% increase in rhino poaching in Africa from 2022 to 2023.  This increase highlights the continued threat to rhino populations despite conservation efforts.

**17. With reference to the pre-monsoon winds in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aandhi or Kali Aandhi are gentle breezes that bring refreshing relief to the north-western plains.
2. Blossom showers are pre-monsoon rains that primarily benefit the tea plantations of Assam.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aandhi or Kali Aandhi are strong dust storms, not gentle breezes.  They are associated with considerable disruption and damage, not relief.  The statement misrepresents the nature of these winds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Blossom showers are associated with the coffee flowers in Kerala and adjacent areas, not the tea plantations of Assam.  The statement wrongly attributes the benefit of these showers to a different region and crop.


**18. With reference to the naming of undersea features in the Indian Ocean, consider the following statements:**

1.  The naming of undersea features outside a country's territorial waters is solely decided by the government of that country.
2.  The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) plays no role in the approval process for naming undersea features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The naming of undersea features outside territorial waters involves proposals from individuals and agencies, reviewed by the IHO Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN).  It's not a unilateral decision by a single government.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IHO, along with UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), is explicitly mentioned as approving the names of the Ashok Seamount, Chandragupt Ridge, and Kalpataru Ridge.  The IHO plays a crucial role in the standardization and approval of names for undersea features.


**19. With reference to the International Forestry Governance (IFG), consider the following statements:**

1. The IFG is a centralized, top-down system controlled by a single international organization.
2. The IFG includes only governmental representatives and excludes other stakeholders in forest management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes the IFG as comprised of policy, legal, and institutional frameworks for international decision-making on forests. This implies a more decentralized and multifaceted structure, not a centralized system controlled by a single organization.  The involvement of multiple stakeholders points towards a collaborative rather than a centralized model.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that stakeholders in the IFG include various entities, not just governmental representatives.  This indicates a broader range of participants involved in forest governance, including non-governmental organizations, local communities, and potentially private sector actors.  The statement wrongly restricts the stakeholders to only government actors.


**1. With reference to the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. IDWH exclusively focuses on supporting protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, neglecting wildlife outside these designated zones.
2. Project Tiger, Project Elephant, and Project Dolphin are all sub-schemes operating under the umbrella of IDWH.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While IDWH does provide significant support to protected areas, a crucial component of the scheme is the protection of wildlife *outside* protected areas. This recognizes that wildlife often ranges beyond the boundaries of formally designated reserves and requires broader conservation efforts.  The scheme aims for a holistic approach to wildlife conservation, encompassing both protected and unprotected habitats.

Statement 2 is correct. Project Tiger (initiated in 1973), Project Elephant (launched in 1992), and Project Dolphin are indeed sub-schemes functioning under the IDWH.  This illustrates the integrated nature of the IDWH, addressing various aspects of wildlife conservation through targeted initiatives focusing on specific species and their habitats.  These projects are not independent but rather fall under the larger IDWH framework, receiving funding and support through it.  The inclusion of these flagship programs highlights the comprehensive nature of IDWH's approach to wildlife conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List assessment reveals a varied status for Indian mangroves, with some regions classified as critically endangered (e.g., South India), while others are categorized as least concern (e.g., Andaman and Bay of Bengal).  It's inaccurate to generalize the status of all Indian mangroves as critically endangered. The report highlights the regional variations in mangrove health and the need for targeted conservation efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ISFR 2023 actually reports an *increase* in mangrove cover in India, albeit a modest one (17 sq km or 0.34%). This signifies some positive progress in mangrove conservation, although further efforts are still required to address the threats faced by these vital ecosystems.  The statement incorrectly presents the trend as a decrease.


**6. With reference to India's initiatives for mangrove conservation, consider the following statements:**
