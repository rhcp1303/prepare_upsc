(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Kaziranga National Park is indeed a renowned National Park in Assam, known for its one-horned rhinoceros population. Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in Kerala is another well-established example of a wildlife sanctuary, famous for its elephant and tiger populations.  However, Kanha National Park is primarily known as a National Park, not a Conservation Reserve, although it may have elements that overlap with conservation reserve designations. Similarly, while community reserves can exist alongside national parks and sanctuaries, Nameri National Park is primarily categorized as a National Park.  The other options incorrectly include Kanha and Nameri as Conservation and Community Reserves respectively, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of protected area categorization within India's biodiversity conservation framework. The correct answer thus accurately reflects the primary designations of Kaziranga and Periyar.

3. Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) Scheme :   Mandates large energy-intensive industries to reduce specific energy consumption
4. Green Credit Programme (GCP)             :   Aligned with 'LiFE' initiative, encourages voluntary participation in environmental activities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PAT scheme focuses on energy efficiency through tradable certificates, not renewable energy directly.  The CCTS indeed incorporates both compliance and offset mechanisms. The REC scheme promotes renewable energy, while the PAT scheme focuses on energy efficiency. The GCP is correctly linked to the LiFE initiative and voluntary participation. Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of these environmental programs. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain mismatched pairs, emphasizing the need to differentiate between the specific goals and mechanisms of these schemes.  Understanding the interplay of these different market-based instruments in achieving environmental goals is important for a comprehensive understanding of India's climate change policies.

   Environmental Issue/Concept              Description/Definition
1. Greenwashing                             :   Exaggerating or misrepresenting environmental claims to mislead consumers
2. K-shaped recovery                         :   Some sectors revive after a slowdown while others don't
3. Gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio :   Indicates a healthier loan portfolio when higher
4. Just Transition                           :   Greening the economy fairly and inclusively, creating decent work opportunities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Greenwashing accurately describes deceptive environmental marketing practices. A K-shaped recovery correctly describes the uneven nature of economic recovery. A higher GNPA ratio indicates a less healthy loan portfolio, making pair 3 incorrect.  Just Transition accurately describes its aims. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) include the incorrect pairing of the GNPA ratio, demonstrating the need for precise understanding of economic indicators and their implications.  Understanding these concepts is crucial for analyzing the environmental and economic consequences of various policies and initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   **International Agreement**                       **Key Feature**
1. Kyoto Protocol                                   :   Limited to developed countries (Annex I)
2. Paris Agreement (Article 6)                     :   Combines market-based and non-market-based approaches
3. Basel Convention                               :   Checks the movement of hazardous waste between countries
4.  UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) :  Established the Green Climate Fund (GCF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, focused primarily on emission reduction commitments from developed countries listed in Annex I.  The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, represents a significant shift towards a more inclusive approach, involving all countries in collaborative efforts to mitigate climate change. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement explicitly allows for both market-based mechanisms (like carbon trading) and non-market-based approaches (like policy measures) for achieving emission reduction targets.  The Basel Convention, established in 1989, is a crucial international treaty aimed at controlling the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, including e-waste, preventing their illegal dumping and promoting environmentally sound management.  The UNFCCC, adopted in 1992, established the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as a financial mechanism to support developing countries in mitigating and adapting to climate change.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Organization**                                  **Primary Mandate**
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)         :   Imposes Environmental Compensation for battery waste non-compliance
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)                   :   Receives compensation under Environment Protection Charge (EPC)
3.  Global Environment Facility (GEF)              :   Administers the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)
4.  World Meteorological Organization (WMO)       :   Spearheads the Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CPCB, under the Battery Waste Management Rules 2022, has the power to impose and collect environmental compensation from entities involved in battery waste management for non-compliance.  The NGT doesn't directly receive compensation under the EPC; rather, the EPC is a mechanism for generating funds that might eventually reach environmental initiatives, but the NGT's role is primarily judicial. The GEF administers several funds, including the LDCF, which supports Least Developed Countries in their adaptation efforts. The WMO, along with the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, spearheads the EW4All initiative to improve early warning systems globally.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Climate Finance Mechanism**                    **Key Characteristic**
1. Green Climate Fund (GCF)                       :   Established during COP27
2. Adaptation Fund                                :   Receives 5% of proceeds from Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement
3. Loss and Damage Fund (FrLD)                     :   Established in 2010
4. Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)              :   Focuses on adaptation, technology transfer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established during COP16 in 2010, not COP27. The Adaptation Fund does indeed receive a share of proceeds from Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement to finance adaptation projects. The Loss and Damage Fund (FrLD) was established during COP27 in 2022. The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) supports projects related to adaptation, technology transfer, and capacity building. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Indian Initiative/Policy**                       **Primary Goal**
1. National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture     :   Promote agroforestry and micro-irrigation
2. Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS)           :   Establish a mandatory program for energy-intensive industries
3. Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme        :   Promote renewable energy through tradable certificates
4.  Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+)    :  Build an alliance between the EU and poor developing countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices, including agroforestry and micro-irrigation. The CCTS establishes a compliance mechanism with mandatory GHG emission intensity targets for energy-intensive industries. The PAT scheme focuses on reducing specific energy consumption in large industries through tradable certificates. The GCCA+ is an EU initiative, not an Indian one. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Environmental Index/Report**                  **Key Feature**
1. SDG India Index 2023-24                         :   Measures progress on 113 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework
2. Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India :  Released by the Ministry of Jal Shakti
3. Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)          :   Evaluates ecological development caused by human interventions
4. Keeling Curve                                    :  Tracks global average concentration of carbon dioxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index measures progress on various indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals. The Annual LULC Atlas is released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not the Ministry of Jal Shakti. The GEPI evaluates the ecological impact of human activities. The Keeling Curve tracks the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

    2. Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) : Launched the ‘Strategy for Environmental Economic Accounts in India: 2022-26’
    3. United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), UNEP, and Secretariat of CBD : Launched the Natural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem services (NCAVES) initiative in 2017
    4. Sir Partha Dasgupta Committee             : Released the first EnviStats in 2018

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Statistical Office (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is indeed mandated with the development of environment statistics and the methodology for National Resource Accounts for India.  MoSPI's role in releasing the 'Strategy for Environmental Economic Accounts in India: 2022-26' is also accurately reflected.  The UNSD, UNEP, and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are correctly identified as the launching bodies of the NCAVES initiative in 2017. Finally, the first EnviStats were released in 2018 based on the recommendations of the Sir Partha Dasgupta Committee. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI), consider the following pairs:**

    State/Entity                          Attribute

    2. GEPI                               : Novel method to evaluate ecological development caused by human interventions
    3. Four Pillars of GEPI                  : Air, soil, tree, and water quality parameters
    4. GEPI Formula                         :  Sum of individual GEPI indices for air, water, soil, and forest

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Uttarakhand is accurately identified as the first Indian state to launch a GEPI. The GEPI's core function as a novel method for evaluating ecological development resulting from human interventions is correct. The four pillars of the GEPI are indeed air, soil, tree, and water, representing key environmental components.  The formula correctly reflects the summation of individual GEPI indices for these four elements. All four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the only correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)     :   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 only
2. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)       :   Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
3. Committee for Air Quality Management    :   National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders
4. National Green Tribunal (NGT)           :   Environment (Protection) Act, 1986

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, pairing it solely with the Air Act is incorrect. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is not directly governed by the Water Act of 1974; its functions relate to groundwater management,  falling under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. The Committee for Air Quality Management's functions are related to air quality, but its establishment isn't tied to a specific act mentioned in the provided text; its actions are often guided by NGT orders. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Initiative                       Key Characteristic/Focus
1.  Namami Gange Programme                 :  Real-time water quality analysis of Ganga only
2.  National Water Awards (NWA)            :  Presented by the President of India
3.  FloodWatch India Application            :  Developed by the Ministry of Jal Shakti

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Namami Gange Programme's scope extends beyond real-time water quality analysis; it also encompasses cleaning the Ganga and its tributaries.  The National Water Awards are indeed presented by the President of India. The FloodWatch India application is developed by the Central Water Commission (CWC), not the Ministry of Jal Shakti. The EW4All initiative is a collaborative effort, co-led by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies mentioned above.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Report/Index                                  Key Feature/Finding
1. SDG India Index 2023-24                  :  Measures progress on 113 indicators aligned to the National Indicator Framework
2.  SDGs – National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report, 2024 : Released by NITI Aayog
3.  Sustainable Development Report 2024     : Ranks countries based on their engagement with the UN System

(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index 2023-24 accurately measures progress on 113 indicators using the National Indicator Framework.  The SDGs – National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report, 2024, is released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not NITI Aayog.  The Sustainable Development Report 2024 doesn't rank countries based on UN engagement; that's described as a separate index (UN-Mi). The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 correctly reflects India's ranking. Thus, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Legislation/Regulation                       Key Provision/Focus
1. Hazardous waste (Management and Handling) Amendment Rules, 2003 : Introduced Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
2. E-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 : First covered hazardous materials in e-waste
3. E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016          : Introduced the concept of Producer Responsibility Organization
4. E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022          : Aims to promote a circular economy through EPR

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The CWC's role is to review the design flood of dams, not to develop early warning systems (pair 1). ISRO is involved in the early warning system, not GLOF risk mitigation projects (pair 3). The NDMA provides guidelines, and the National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee contributed to the NMHS's glacial lake study in Sikkim.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific roles played by different organizations in managing GLOF risks. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings acts as effective distractors, requiring a precise understanding of the division of labor among these organizations. This question necessitates a deeper analysis and understanding of the institutional framework for GLOFs management in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Category of Glacial Lake                  Example
1. Moraine-dammed                             :   South Lhonak Lake
2. Ice-dammed                                 :   Tenchungkha Lake
3. Erosion                                    :   Chorabari Lake
4. Other Glacial Lakes                         :   Gilkey Glacier, Alaska


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. While the text mentions the categories of glacial lakes and gives examples of GLOFs, it does not explicitly categorize Tenchungkha Lake or Chorabari Lake into specific dam types.  South Lhonak GLOF is linked to moraine dam instability. Gilkey Glacier, while used as an example of glacial surging, is not a glacial lake.  The question tests the candidate's ability to connect specific GLOF events with the underlying type of glacial lake formation.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect classifications and examples acts as effective distractors, highlighting the need for precise information recall.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the different types of glacial lakes and their relevance in GLOF formation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region with Notable Glacial Lake Expansion     State/UT
1.  Ladakh                                         :   Himachal Pradesh
2. Uttarakhand                                    :   Uttarakhand
3. Sikkim                                          :   Sikkim
4. Arunachal Pradesh                             :   Arunachal Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) All four
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The text mentions that Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh experienced notable glacial lake expansion. However, Ladakh itself is a UT, so pairing it with Himachal Pradesh is incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately link regions with significant glacial lake expansion to their respective states or UTs.  The deliberately incorrect pairing of Ladakh with Himachal Pradesh acts as a strong distractor, demanding precise knowledge rather than general awareness of Himalayan geography. This question assesses factual recall and attention to detail in associating geographic areas with specific environmental phenomena.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Phenomenon                     Description
1. Aandhi/Kali Aandhi             :   Pre-monsoon showers in coastal Karnataka and Kerala
2. Mango showers                   :   Strong dust storms in northwestern and central India
3. Blossom showers                 :   Strong southerly/southwesterly winds along the Malabar coast
4. Elephanta winds                 :   Pre-monsoon showers aiding mango ripening in coastal Karnataka and Kerala

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Elephanta winds are indeed strong southerly and southwesterly winds along the Malabar coast that mark the end of the southwest monsoon.  The other pairings are incorrect. Aandhi/Kali Aandhi are strong dust storms, not pre-monsoon showers in coastal Karnataka and Kerala. Mango showers are pre-monsoon showers causing early ripening of mangoes, not strong dust storms. Blossom showers are pre-monsoon showers in Kerala and adjacent areas, not strong winds along the Malabar coast.  The question tests factual recall of specific meteorological phenomena and their characteristics, requiring precise knowledge to avoid the plausible distractors.  Understanding the timing and location of these events is crucial for a correct answer. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent related but ultimately incorrect associations, demanding a high degree of accuracy in knowledge recall.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Undersea Feature                Location
1. Ashok Seamount                  :   Northeast Indian Ridge
2. Chandragupt Ridge               :   Southwest Indian Ridge
3. Kalpataru Ridge                  :   Central Indian Ridge

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Chandragupt Ridge and Kalpataru Ridge are indeed located along the Southwest Indian Ridge.  The location of Ashok Seamount is incorrectly stated in option 1; it too is located on the Southwest Indian Ridge. Option 3 incorrectly states the location of Kalpataru Ridge. Option 1 and 3 are incorrect due to the mismatched locations. The question assesses factual knowledge of geographical features, specifically undersea features in the Indian Ocean, and their precise locations.  The distractors are strategically designed to test the candidate's depth of understanding, requiring them to differentiate between similar sounding locations and features.  Correctly answering this question necessitates a strong grasp of oceanographic details and the ability to recall specific names and locations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Glacial Lake Category         Description
1. Moraine-dammed                 :   Water dammed by ice
2. Ice-dammed                     :   Water dammed by erosion
3. Erosion                         :   Water dammed by moraine
4. Other glacial lakes             :   Water dammed by a combination of ice and moraine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Erosion glacial lakes are indeed formed by water being dammed in depressions created by erosion. The other pairs incorrectly associate lake formation with the wrong damming material.  Moraine-dammed lakes are formed by moraines (deposits of rock and soil left by glaciers), not ice. Ice-dammed lakes are formed by ice, not erosion.  "Other glacial lakes" is too broad a category to be paired with a specific description. This question tests knowledge of glacial lake formation and categorization, requiring detailed understanding of geological processes.  The distractors are carefully crafted to represent common misconceptions or alternative interpretations, making the question challenging even for those with some prior knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    GLOF Event                        Location
1. 2023 GLOF                         :   Chorabari glacial lake, Uttarakhand
2. 2013 GLOF                         :   South Lhonak, Sikkim
3. Mandakini River flood (2013)    :   Teesta III Dam, Chungthang, Sikkim


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The 2023 GLOF occurred at South Lhonak, Sikkim, not Chorabari Lake.  The 2013 GLOF at Chorabari Lake caused flooding in the Mandakini River, not in Sikkim. The Teesta III Dam was damaged by the 2023 South Lhonak GLOF. This question tests knowledge of specific GLOF events, their locations, and the consequences. The incorrect pairings use real events and locations, making the distractors highly plausible and requiring precise recall of details to answer correctly.  The question emphasizes the importance of precise knowledge of geographical locations and specific events in the context of GLOFs.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Oil Spill Mitigation Technique    Description

2. Floating barriers                 :   Use of living organisms to remove contaminants
3. Sorbents                           :   Temporary floating barriers
4. Booms and Skimmers              :   Materials that absorb oil


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Sorbents are indeed materials that absorb oil, and booms and skimmers are used together to contain and remove oil from water. Bioremediation uses living organisms, not booms and skimmers. Floating barriers are a type of boom, not a separate technique.  This question assesses knowledge of oil spill mitigation techniques and their characteristics.  The distractors are plausible, requiring specific knowledge of each technique to avoid confusion. The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar-sounding techniques and their applications in oil spill response.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Wetland Site                      Location
1. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries :   Tamil Nadu
2. Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary       :   Bihar
3. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary         :   Tamil Nadu
4. Tawa Reservoir                   :   Madhya Pradesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary is located in Tamil Nadu, and Tawa Reservoir is in Madhya Pradesh.  Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries are located in Bihar, not Tamil Nadu. Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary is in Tamil Nadu, not Bihar. This question assesses knowledge of specific Ramsar sites in India and their locations.  The distractors utilize real wetland locations, making the question challenging and requiring precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of these sites.  The candidate must possess accurate information to avoid the plausible distractors.



**7. With reference to the  'Heat Budget of the Earth', consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                                  Impact on Heat Budget
1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions              :   Increased outgoing heat radiation
2. Ozone Layer Thinning                  :   Increased incoming solar radiation
3. Glacier Melting                       :   Reduced albedo effect, increasing heat absorption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Glacier melting does indeed reduce the Earth's albedo (reflectivity), leading to increased heat absorption.  Greenhouse gas emissions increase, not decrease, outgoing heat radiation (trapping heat within the atmosphere). Ozone layer thinning increases, not decreases, incoming ultraviolet radiation, not solar radiation. This question tests conceptual understanding of the Earth's heat budget and the impacts of various factors. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the complex interactions involved and their effects on radiative balance.  A nuanced understanding of climate science is needed to answer this question correctly.


**8. With reference to the 'Kallakkadal' phenomenon, consider the following pairs:**

2. Cause                                  :   Local winds
3. Type of Waves                          :   Tsunami waves
4. Location                               :   East coast of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Kallakkadal occurs in the pre-monsoon or post-monsoon season, not only during the monsoon.  It is caused by swell waves generated by distant storms, not local winds. The waves involved are swell waves, not tsunamis. It affects the southwest, not the east coast of India. This question tests understanding of a specific meteorological phenomenon, requiring accurate knowledge of its characteristics and geographical context. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent common misconceptions about coastal flooding, demanding a high level of understanding of oceanographic and meteorological processes.


**9. With reference to  'Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD)', consider the following pairs:**

    Cause of AD                                  Description
1. Global Warming                            :   Increases oxygen solubility in water
2. Warm surface ocean layers                 :   Prevent oxygen mixing from surface to deeper waters
3. Eutrophication                            :   Reduces algal blooms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Warm surface ocean layers do indeed prevent oxygen from mixing down into deeper waters, contributing to AD. Global warming decreases, not increases, oxygen solubility in water. Eutrophication increases, not reduces, algal blooms, which consume oxygen. This question tests understanding of the causes of aquatic deoxygenation, requiring knowledge of oceanographic processes and their interactions with environmental factors. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the complex interplay of factors contributing to AD, requiring a clear understanding of environmental science principles to avoid incorrect associations.


**10. With reference to the 'Planetary Boundaries' framework, consider the following pairs:**

    Planetary Boundary                         Status
1. Climate Change                              :   Not transgressed
2. Ocean Acidification                         :   Transgressed
3. Stratospheric Ozone Depletion              :   Not transgressed

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion are not yet transgressed according to the planetary boundaries framework. Ocean acidification is considered transgressed.  This question tests knowledge of the planetary boundaries framework and the current status of each boundary.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the framework's complexity and the current state of the Earth's systems.  The question demands accurate recall of the framework's key aspects and its implications for environmental management.

5. Classification of Crocodiles                      :   Endothermic

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Crocodile Conservation Project was indeed launched in 1975.  This is a well-established fact in Indian wildlife conservation history.  The project's primary focus was on saltwater crocodiles, making statement 4 partially correct, as while other crocodiles were also beneficiaries, saltwater crocodiles were a major focus.  However, the project began in Odisha's Bhitarkanika National Park, not the Sunderbans. The UNDP and FAO, not the WWF, provided assistance. Crocodiles are poikilothermic (cold-blooded), not endothermic (warm-blooded), meaning they rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are partially correct.  The other options are incorrect due to these factual inaccuracies.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies within seemingly plausible options. The inclusion of seemingly correct yet ultimately false statements (such as the involvement of WWF and the endothermic nature of crocodiles) highlights the importance of precise knowledge in answering UPSC-style questions.


**2. With reference to Fungi and its Conservation, consider the following pairs:**

   Fungal Characteristic                           Description

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fungi belong to their own kingdom, distinct from Plantae (plants), Animalia (animals), Protista, and Monera.  The Fungi Foundation advocates for the inclusion of "funga" alongside "flora" and "fauna," not as a replacement for them. Fungi encompass both single-celled and multicellular organisms.  They are found in diverse terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  Fungi are decomposers, not primary producers; they obtain their energy from breaking down organic matter, unlike plants which produce their own energy through photosynthesis.  All the given pairs are incorrect, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of fungal biology and the nuances of ecological terminology. The question tests factual recall and understanding of basic biological classifications.  The incorrect options are strong distractors, testing the candidate’s ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.

4. Species Recovery Program                        :   Protection of only endangered species
5. Protected Area Support                           :   Community Reserves only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger focuses on tiger conservation, not Asiatic lions (which are covered under a separate program). Project Elephant aims at the conservation of elephants and their habitats, not exclusively in the Western Ghats.  While Project Dolphin focuses on the conservation of the Ganges River Dolphin, its scope extends to other river dolphins in India. The Species Recovery Program focuses on critically endangered species and their habitats and  Protected Area Support includes National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves, and Community Reserves. Thus, only statement 3 is entirely correct. The other options are incorrect because of these inaccuracies in the pairings, highlighting the need for detailed knowledge of specific conservation programs under IDWH. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific government initiatives related to wildlife conservation. The inclusion of incorrect yet plausible pairings makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between factual details.

3. Information Included                             :   Market prices of bioresources
4. Primary Purpose                                  :   Commercial exploitation of bioresources
5. Key Benefit                                      :   Empowerment of multinational corporations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PBRs are established under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, not the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.  While BMCs (Biodiversity Management Committees) are involved, the preparation of PBRs involves consultation with local communities and stakeholders beyond just Panchayats. PBRs document traditional knowledge and bioresource use, not market prices. The purpose is conservation and sustainable resource management, not commercial exploitation.  PBRs aim to empower local communities, not multinational corporations. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests factual recall concerning the legal framework, implementation, and objectives of PBRs. The incorrect options, while seemingly plausible due to superficial similarity to actual aspects of PBRs, serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's capacity for precise factual recall.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IBCA was launched in 2023, not 2022. Its headquarters are indeed in India. Seven big cat species are covered. The IBCA receives funding from various sources, not just private funding. All UN member countries are eligible for membership, not just big cat range countries. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the IBCA's structure, objectives, and funding mechanisms. The inclusion of partially correct and entirely incorrect pairings serves as a significant distractor, assessing the candidate's ability to carefully evaluate the accuracy of each statement.


**8. With reference to the Elephant Census 2023 (Southern States), consider the following pairs:**

   Census Finding                                     Detail
1. State with Highest Elephant Population          :   Kerala
2. Age Group with Highest Death Rate               :   Adults (aged 20 and above)
3. Primary Cause of Juvenile Deaths                :   Poaching
4. Methodology                                      :   Direct counting only
5.  Data Collection Period                         :   One month


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Karnataka, not Kerala, had the highest elephant population among the southern states. Juvenile elephants (aged 10 and below), not adults, had the highest death rate.  Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesviruses (EEHVs), not poaching, were the primary cause. The census employed various methodologies, not just direct counting. The data collection period was longer than one month.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question challenges the candidate to recall specific details from the elephant census report, testing their ability to differentiate between closely related data points.  The incorrect pairings are designed to be plausible distractors, requiring precise knowledge of the census findings.


**9. With reference to the State of the Rhino 2024 Report, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Finding                                   Detail
1. Total Global Rhino Population                   :   Over 30,000
2. Region with Increased Rhino Poaching           :   Asia
3. Rhino Species with Increased Population        :   Black Rhino
4. Organization Publishing the Report              :   World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
5.  Focus on Indian Rhino Population              :   Significant decrease

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The total global rhino population was under 28,000, not over 30,000.  Africa, not Asia, experienced increased rhino poaching. The white rhino, not the black rhino, showed a population increase. The International Rhino Foundation (IRF), not the WWF, published the report. The Indian rhino population remained relatively stable, not significantly decreasing.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question requires detailed knowledge of the report's key findings on rhino populations and conservation challenges. The incorrect options are strategically designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar species and regions, demanding precise knowledge of the report's content.


**10. With reference to the Great Indian Bustard Recovery Program, consider the following pairs:**

   Program Aspect                                   Detail
1. Primary Funding Agency                          :   Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change

3. Duration                                          :   2013-2023
4. Species Covered                                 :   Great Indian Bustard only
5.  Key Conservation Strategy                     :   Habitat Restoration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) is the primary funding agency, not the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, although the latter plays a significant role. The Wildlife Institute of India, not the Bombay Natural History Society, is the primary implementing agency. The program's duration extends beyond 2023 to 2033.  The program covers both the Great Indian Bustard and Lesser Florican.  Conservation breeding and surgical habitat management are also major strategies, not just habitat restoration. Thus, only statement 1 is partially correct. This question tests detailed knowledge of the program’s structure, implementation, and objectives. The partially correct and incorrect options serve as strong distractors, assessing the candidate's capacity to accurately analyze the information provided.  The question demands precise knowledge of the program's timeline and the organizations involved.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Project                      Focus Area
1. Project Tiger                         :  Protection of tigers outside protected areas
2. Project Elephant                     :  Conservation of elephants in Southern States
3. Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) : Support to community reserves

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger, while primarily focused on tiger conservation within protected areas, also indirectly contributes to their protection outside such areas through habitat management and anti-poaching measures. However, its core mandate is within protected areas.  Project Elephant, while encompassing broader conservation efforts, has a strong focus on elephant populations, particularly in southern India, where significant elephant ranges exist. The Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) is a comprehensive scheme that provides support to various protected area categories, including community reserves, aiming to improve their management and conservation effectiveness.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect the primary focus areas. Option (a) is incorrect because Project Tiger's primary focus is within protected areas, not exclusively outside them. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete, as IDWH also plays a crucial role. Option (d) is incorrect as IDWH is a much broader scheme than just supporting community reserves.

1. Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 : Ranks countries on climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality
2. Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024   : India ranked 176 out of 180 countries
3. State of the Rhino 2024 Report       :  India's rhino population remained the same

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 indeed uses numerous indicators across several issue categories to rank countries on their environmental performance.  The Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024 correctly reflects India's ranking.  However, the State of the Rhino 2024 Report focuses on global rhino populations; the report does not provide specific details about India's rhino population. While the report may mention India, a specific statement about the population remaining unchanged is not a definitive finding attributable to the report itself, therefore it is not a correct match.  Option (a) is incomplete, omitting the correct pairing of NCI and its finding regarding India. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of the third pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the accurate pairing of the EPI and its key characteristic.

   Disaster Management Element                Description
1. NDRF R&R Window                         :   Assists states with funds exceeding their coping capacity for expenditure.
2. Nodal Agency for Implementation        :    Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
3. Calamities covered under R&R funding    :   Only drought, earthquake, and flood
4. FloodWatch India Application             : Developed by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
5. EW4All initiative                        : Aims to protect everyone from hazardous weather events by 2030.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NDRF R&R window is correctly matched with its function of providing additional funds to states when their own resources are insufficient to meet disaster-related expenses.  The EW4All initiative's goal to protect everyone from hazardous weather, water, or climate events by 2027 is also accurately paired.

Option (a) is incorrect because the nodal agency for implementation is the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), not the Ministry of Home Affairs, although MHA issues guidelines. Option (b) is incorrect due to the incorrect nodal agency. Option (d) is incorrect because the calamities covered under R&R funding are far more extensive than just drought, earthquake, and flood, including cyclone, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloud burst, pest attack, frost & cold wave. The FloodWatch India application is developed by the Central Water Commission (CWC), not the IMD.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Function/Mandate
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)      :   Responsible for implementing air pollution control legislation exclusively.
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)               :   Receives environmental compensation only as per orders from the Supreme Court.
3. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)          :   Monitors and manages surface water resources.
4. Committee for Air Quality Management      :   Operates solely within the jurisdiction of Delhi-NCR.
5. National Statistical Office (NSO)            :   Mandated with developing environment statistics and National Resource Accounts for India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of the National Statistical Office (NSO) with its mandate to develop environment statistics and National Resource Accounts for India is entirely correct.

Option (a) is incorrect because the CPCB's responsibilities extend beyond air pollution to include water pollution control as well. Option (b) is incorrect because of the inaccurate CPCB description. Option (c) is incorrect because the NGT receives environmental compensation from various sources, including the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal, and CGWB focuses on groundwater resources, not surface water. Option (d) is correct because the NSO's function is accurately described.  The Committee for Air Quality Management has a broader mandate than just Delhi-NCR.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. Parametric Insurance                                  :   Compensates for actual losses incurred from a covered event.
2. Recovery and Reconstruction (R&R) Funding Window   :  Funds are exclusively allocated from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).
3. Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)                :  Evaluates ecological development solely based on water quality.
4.  Just Transition                                        :  Focuses solely on creating new jobs in renewable energy sector.
5.  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index        :   Measures progress on 113 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Parametric insurance is correctly paired with its key feature of covering the probability of a loss-causing event rather than the actual loss. The SDG India Index accurately measures national progress using 113 indicators.

Option (a) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the descriptions of other pairs. Option (c) is incorrect because R&R funding can come from both NDRF and SDRF, and GEPI considers multiple environmental factors (air, soil, water, forests). Option (d) is incorrect as the SDG India Index is correctly matched.  The Just Transition concept encompasses a broader approach to economic greening than solely focusing on renewable energy jobs.  Therefore only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Legislation/Regulation                         Provision/Focus
1. E-waste (Management) Rules, 2022                        :   Introduced the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for the first time.
2. Hazardous waste (Management and Handling) Amendment Rules, 2003:  Focused primarily on the management of refrigerants.
3.  Environment (Protection) Act, 1986                       :  Solely governs the notification of Eco-Sensitive Areas (ESAs).
4. Biological Diversity Act (2002)                             :  Mandates the preparation of People’s Biodiversity Registers (PBRs) by the State Biodiversity Boards.
5. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 : Allows harvesting of organs only from brain-dead patients.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 with its allowance for organ harvesting from both living donors and brain-dead patients with consent is entirely correct.

Option (a) is incorrect because the EPR concept was introduced earlier than 2022. Option (b) is incorrect because the 2003 rules covered hazardous materials in e-waste, not just refrigerants, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 has a broader scope than only ESA notification. Option (c) is incorrect because PBR preparation is mandated by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs), not State Biodiversity Boards. Therefore, only pair 5 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Himalayan State/UT        Significant Feature Related to Glacial Lake Expansion
1. Ladakh                     :   Experienced a 40% increase in glacial lake surface area between 2011 and 2024.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question assesses factual recall and the ability to analyze information related to glacial lake expansion in the Himalayas. Option (c) is correct because all the pairs accurately reflect the data presented in the source material.  Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh are all mentioned as regions with significant glacial lake expansion, with specific details supporting the claims for Uttarakhand and Sikkim.  The 40% increase in surface area for certain lakes in Ladakh and the vulnerability of 13 lakes in Uttarakhand to GLOFs are explicitly stated. The 2023 GLOF event in Sikkim at South Lhonak further corroborates the information.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude some of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete factual recall.  The distractors in the options are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and potentially misleading information, given that all the states mentioned are indeed experiencing glacial lake expansion.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Aandhi/Kali Aandhi           :   Strong dust storms in northwestern and central India before the monsoon.
3. Mango Showers                  :   Pre-monsoon showers in coastal Karnataka and Kerala aiding mango ripening.
4. Blossom Showers                :   Pre-monsoon showers in Kerala and adjacent areas causing coffee flower blossoming.
5. Elephanta Winds               :   Strong southerly and southwesterly winds along the Malabar coast, post-monsoon.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question tests factual recall and understanding of various meteorological phenomena in India. Option (c) is correct because all five pairs accurately describe the given phenomena. Kallakkadal is correctly defined as coastal flooding due to swell waves, Aandhi/Kali Aandhi as strong dust storms, Mango Showers as pre-monsoon showers aiding mango ripening, Blossom Showers as pre-monsoon showers causing coffee flower blossoming, and Elephanta Winds as strong post-monsoon winds.  The other options are incorrect because they omit some or all of the correctly matched pairs. The inclusion of multiple, plausible, but ultimately incorrect options serves as effective distractors, assessing the candidate's depth of knowledge and ability to eliminate incorrect information.  The question requires precise knowledge of regional weather patterns and terminology, making it a challenging yet relevant question for the UPSC examination.

Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of bioremediation with the use of booms and skimmers.  Option (d) incorrectly includes the use of floating volcanic ash barriers as a remediation technique. These incorrect pairings are plausible distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of oil spill response. The question requires a precise knowledge of the different methods employed in oil spill cleanup operations and therefore tests both factual recall and conceptual understanding.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of Aquatic Deoxygenation    Explanation
1. Global Warming                   :   Increased nutrient enrichment from agricultural runoff.
2. Warm Surface Layers              :   Prevent oxygen from mixing deeper into the ocean.
3. Eutrophication                   :   Rise in temperatures decreases oxygen solubility in water.
4. Anthropogenic Sources            :   Lead to algal blooms and increased oxygen consumption.
5. Green House Gases                :   Rise in temperatures decreases oxygen solubility in water.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of the causes of aquatic deoxygenation. Only two pairs are correctly matched: Warm surface layers prevent oxygen mixing, and eutrophication leads to algal blooms and increased oxygen consumption.  Global warming, while contributing to aquatic deoxygenation, does so primarily by decreasing oxygen solubility (as correctly stated in pair 5), not through nutrient enrichment (as incorrectly stated in pair 1). Anthropogenic sources contribute to eutrophication (pair 4 is a component of pair 3). Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs. The distractors are designed to assess a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay of factors contributing to aquatic deoxygenation.  The question demands both factual knowledge and the ability to analyze cause-and-effect relationships.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

4. Heat Budget of the Earth       :   Balance between incoming solar heat and outgoing terrestrial heat
5.  Pyrocumulonimbus clouds       :   Clouds that produce significant rainfall


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lahars are indeed mudflows composed of volcanic material, making pair 1 correct. Kallakkadal accurately describes coastal flooding due to swell waves on India's southwest coast, validating pair 2. GLOFs are correctly defined as the sudden release of water from glacial lakes, confirming pair 3. The heat budget of Earth correctly represents the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation, thus pair 4 is also correct. However, Pyrocumulonimbus clouds are notorious for producing *very little* rainfall, contrary to statement 5.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude pair 5, which is mismatched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of environmental phenomena.  The inclusion of the incorrect statement about Pyrocumulonimbus clouds serves as a strong distractor, making the question challenging and demanding careful evaluation of each pair.


**2. With reference to environmental hazards, consider the following pairs:**

   Hazard                           Characteristic

2.  Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal :   Occur more frequently than in the Arabian Sea
3.  Aandhi or Kali Aandhi         :   Strong dust storms in northwestern and central India before the monsoon
4.  Mango showers                  :   Pre-monsoon showers along coastal Karnataka and Kerala
5. Loo                               :  Hot, dry winds blowing throughout the daytime in north and western India during September and October


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The statement about cyclones in Southeast Asia is incorrect, as they are now forming closer to coasts, intensifying more rapidly, and lingering longer over land.  This makes option (d) and (c) incorrect. The Bay of Bengal does experience more cyclones than the Arabian Sea (approximately a 4:1 ratio). Aandhi or Kali Aandhi are accurately described as strong dust storms preceding the monsoon. Mango showers are correctly identified as pre-monsoon showers in coastal Karnataka and Kerala. However, the Loo is a hot, dry wind that blows during May and June, not September and October.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) correctly identifies these, while the other options include the incorrect pair 1 or 5, or both. The question tests factual knowledge of various weather phenomena and their characteristics, demanding accurate recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in descriptions.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect statements elevates the difficulty level.

(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) Only 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PREFIRE accurately measures the heat radiated from the polar regions. CoS-it-FloWS uses community-sourced data for flood forecasting in Kerala. EW4All aims to provide global early warnings for various hazards by 2027. However, DEWS is a drought early warning system, not a flood forecasting system, and FloodWatch India uses more than 100 rain gauges. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.  Option (b) correctly reflects this. The other options incorrectly include or exclude pairs 3 or 4, which are mismatched. This question tests knowledge of specific environmental monitoring and early warning systems in India and globally. The inclusion of incorrect details makes it a challenging question, requiring careful analysis and evaluation of each pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Kingdom                                     Characteristic Feature
1. Plantae                                      :   Heterotrophic mode of nutrition
2. Animalia                                   :   Cell wall with chitin
3. Fungi                                       :   Primary producer in ecosystem

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The provided pairings incorrectly associate characteristics with kingdoms. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Plantae (Plants): Heterotrophic mode of nutrition** - This is incorrect. Plants are autotrophs, meaning they produce their own food through photosynthesis. Heterotrophs obtain energy by consuming other organisms.

2. **Animalia (Animals): Cell wall with chitin** - This is incorrect.  Animals lack cell walls.  Chitin is a structural polysaccharide found in the cell walls of fungi and the exoskeletons of some animals (like insects), but not as a defining characteristic of the Animalia kingdom.

3. **Fungi: Primary producer in ecosystem** - This is incorrect. Fungi are decomposers; they break down organic matter. Primary producers, such as plants and some algae, are the base of the food chain, producing their own energy through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.


The question tests the fundamental understanding of the characteristics of the three kingdoms: Plantae, Animalia, and Fungi.  The distractors are designed to exploit potential misconceptions about the nutritional modes and structural components of these groups.  A thorough understanding of basic biology is crucial to correctly identify the mismatches.  The correct answer highlights the importance of accurate biological classification and understanding the roles of organisms within ecosystems.

   Organization                                   Focus Area
1. IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) :   Mycoremediation
2. Global Fungal Red List Initiative             :   Carbon reservoirs
3. Chile's Conservation Law                     :   Biosphere reserves

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The question tests the knowledge of various organizations and their roles in fungal conservation and environmental protection. Let’s analyze each pair:

1. **IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC): Mycoremediation** -  While FunCC focuses on fungal conservation, mycoremediation (using fungi to remediate pollutants) is not its primary or sole focus.  FunCC's work is broader, encompassing various aspects of fungal biodiversity and conservation.

2. **Global Fungal Red List Initiative: Carbon reservoirs** - The Global Fungal Red List Initiative assesses the conservation status of fungal species. While fungi play a role in carbon cycling, the initiative's direct focus is on species conservation, not specifically on their role as carbon reservoirs.

3. **Chile's Conservation Law: Biosphere reserves** -  While Chile's law is noteworthy for including fungi in its conservation efforts,  it's not solely focused on biosphere reserves. The law likely encompasses a wider range of conservation measures and protected areas.

The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of understanding the nuanced roles of various organizations in environmental conservation and the complexities of biodiversity protection.  The distractors are designed to make the examinee consider the general association between the organizations and their environmental roles, rather than their specific focus.  A deep understanding of conservation initiatives and their scope is essential for correctly answering this question.

2. PFAS                                         :   Resist photolytic degradation
3. Dieldrin                                     :   Low lipid solubility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge about the properties of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

1. **DDT: High water solubility** - This is incorrect. DDT is characterized by its low water solubility and high lipid solubility, which contributes to its persistence in the environment and bioaccumulation in organisms.

2. **PFAS: Resist photolytic degradation** - This is correct. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are highly persistent due to their resistance to various degradation processes, including photolysis (breakdown by light).

3. **Dieldrin: Low lipid solubility** - This is incorrect.  Dieldrin, like many other POPs, is highly lipid-soluble, facilitating its bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of organisms.

The question highlights the importance of understanding the key chemical properties that contribute to the persistence and environmental impact of POPs.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge about the specific properties of different POPs, emphasizing the need for detailed understanding rather than general knowledge.  The correct answer underscores the significance of knowing the chemical characteristics that make certain substances environmentally persistent and harmful.

2. Enhanced Weathering                             :   Mining of rocks to absorb CO2
3. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) :   Using biomass for energy and geological carbon storage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question assesses knowledge of different Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies and their mechanisms.

1. **Afforestation/Reforestation: Ocean fertilization** - This is incorrect.  Afforestation and reforestation involve planting trees to sequester carbon in biomass and soil. Ocean fertilization is a separate CDR method involving adding nutrients to the ocean to stimulate phytoplankton growth and carbon uptake.

2. **Enhanced Weathering: Mining of rocks to absorb CO2** - This is correct. Enhanced weathering involves accelerating the natural process of rock weathering to capture atmospheric CO2. This often involves mining and spreading rocks containing minerals that react with CO2.

3. **Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS): Using biomass for energy and geological carbon storage** - This is correct. BECCS combines biomass energy production with carbon capture and storage, capturing the CO2 released during biomass combustion and storing it underground.

The question tests the understanding of different approaches to carbon removal.  The distractors are designed to confuse the examinee by mixing up different CDR methods and their mechanisms. A strong understanding of climate change mitigation strategies and technological approaches is needed to answer correctly.  The correct answer highlights the importance of understanding various carbon removal technologies and their potential roles in achieving climate goals.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant                                  Impact
1. DCPA (Dacthal)                             :   Impaired kidney function
2. Bisphenol A (BPA)                          :   Low birth weight in fetuses
3. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) :   Endocrine disruption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of specific pollutants and their associated health impacts.

1. **DCPA (Dacthal): Impaired kidney function** - This is incorrect. While DCPA is a harmful pesticide, its primary known effects relate to developmental problems in fetuses, such as low birth weight, impaired brain development, and decreased IQ, not specifically impaired kidney function.

2. **Bisphenol A (BPA): Low birth weight in fetuses** - This is correct. BPA exposure has been linked to various health problems, including low birth weight in fetuses, as well as impacts on the brain and prostate gland.

3. **Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS): Endocrine disruption** - This is correct. PFAS are known endocrine disruptors, interfering with the body's hormonal system and potentially leading to various health issues.

The question tests detailed knowledge of specific pollutants and their effects.  The distractors are designed to test the examinee's understanding of the specific health impacts associated with each pollutant, rather than relying on general awareness of environmental pollutants. The correct response emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific health risks associated with exposure to various environmental contaminants.  The question is designed to assess detailed knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding effects of different pollutants.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Report                                   Key Feature/Finding
1. Stockholm Convention                             :   Addresses PFAS as industrial POPs
2. 2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) :   Assesses climate strategies of major global companies
3. Global Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) Assessment report     :   Focuses on regional cooperation on air pollution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of environmental initiatives and their key aspects.

1. **Stockholm Convention: Addresses PFAS as industrial POPs** - This is correct. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) includes certain PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) as controlled substances due to their persistence and harmful effects.

2. **2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM): Assesses climate strategies of major global companies** - This is correct. The CCRM report analyzes the climate-related strategies and disclosures of large companies, assessing their transparency and ambition in addressing climate change.

3. **Global Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) Assessment report: Focuses on regional cooperation on air pollution** - This is incorrect.  While the CCAC (Climate and Clean Air Coalition) is involved in both the N2O report and air pollution initiatives, the N2O report specifically focuses on nitrous oxide emissions, not regional air pollution cooperation.  The UN Environment Assembly resolution mentioned in the source text relates to regional cooperation, but this is not the direct focus of the N2O assessment.

The question tests knowledge of specific environmental agreements and reports.  The distractors are designed to mislead the examinee by associating reports with tangential or related but ultimately incorrect topics.  Correctly answering this question requires precise knowledge of the focus and content of each initiative mentioned.  The correct answer emphasizes the importance of detailed knowledge about international environmental agreements and assessments of corporate climate action.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology                             Description/Application

2. Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) :   Mandatory for all listed companies
3. Direct Air Capture and Storage (DAC+S)        :   Captures CO2 at the point of emission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of various environmental concepts and technologies.

1. **Superhydrophobic Catalysts: Derived from graphene** - This is incorrect. While superhydrophobic catalysts can exhibit similar properties to graphene in terms of surface area and reactivity, they are explicitly derived from biomass (cellulose), not graphene.

2. **Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR): Mandatory for all listed companies** - This is incorrect. BRSR is mandatory for the top 1000 listed companies in India, not all listed companies.

3. **Direct Air Capture and Storage (DAC+S): Captures CO2 at the point of emission** - This is incorrect. DAC+S specifically captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere, not at the point of emission (like traditional carbon capture technologies).

The question tests the detailed understanding of specific technologies and regulations. The distractors are designed to exploit common misconceptions or partial knowledge about these topics.  The correct answer emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of the characteristics and applications of each technology or initiative. This question highlights the importance of accurate information about sustainable business practices and carbon capture technologies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Term                     Description
1. Keeling Curve                           :   Record of atmospheric CO2 from Mauna Loa Observatory since 1958
2. Greenium                               :   Additional cost of choosing a clean technology over one emitting more greenhouse gases
3. Teal Carbon                             :   Carbon stored in tidal saltwater wetlands
4.  Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD)   : Water depth where calcium carbonate supply equals dissolution rate

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Keeling Curve accurately represents the continuous record of atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii since 1958.  Greenium correctly defines the premium paid for environmentally friendly technologies due to their lower carbon footprint and associated benefits. The Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD) is indeed the depth in the ocean where the rate of calcium carbonate supply from the surface equals its rate of dissolution.  However, Teal Carbon is incorrectly defined in option 3. Teal carbon refers to carbon stored in *non-tidal freshwater wetlands*, not tidal saltwater wetlands.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pair related to Teal Carbon.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound/Substance        Characteristic/Use
1. Bisphenol A (BPA)                     : Primarily used in production of polyester plastics
2. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) :  Quickly breaks down in the environment
3.  Steel Slag                             :  Solid waste generated during aluminum production
4. Bioplastics                            : Produced from non-renewable resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. BPA is primarily used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, not polyester plastics. PFAS are known as "forever chemicals" because they persist in the environment and human bodies, breaking down extremely slowly. Steel slag is a byproduct of steelmaking, not aluminum production. Bioplastics are produced from renewable resources like carbohydrates and vegetable oils, not non-renewable resources.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Process/Concept       Description
1. Soil Acidification                    : Soil pH increases over time
2. Biocover                              : System for controlling fugitive methane emissions from landfills
3. Grasshopper Effect                   : Accumulation of pollutants in tropical regions
4.  Hydrogel                             : Material unable to bind microplastics


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the description of Biocover is correct. Soil acidification is a process where soil pH *decreases* over time. The grasshopper effect describes the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic and other high-latitude regions, not tropical regions.  Hydrogels are specifically designed to bind and remove microplastics from water. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue/Technology      Related Term/Organization
1.  Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) : CO2-to-Methanol Conversion
2.  WHO Air Quality Guidelines (AQG)    :  UNEP Resolution 10
3.  Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report  :  Released by the FAO
4.  Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD)     : Removal of NO2 from coal-fired power plants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. CO2-to-Methanol Conversion is a key technology under CCU.  The WHO Air Quality Guidelines are related to the CCAC Clean Air Flagship, not directly to UNEP Resolution 10. The Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report is released by the World Bank, not the FAO. FGD systems remove SO2, not NO2, from coal-fired power plants.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Concept/Term          Explanation
1.  Megafauna                           : Animals weighing below 50 kg
2.  Gape Limitation                     :  Predator's ability to consume prey of any size
3.  Stromatolites                        :  Microbial communities associated with layers of rock
4.  Aerobiology                          : Study of airborne biological particles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the definitions of Stromatolites and Aerobiology are correct. Megafauna refers to animals *above* a certain weight threshold (generally above 50 kg). Gape limitation refers to the physical constraint on the size of prey a predator can consume, based on its mouth size; it doesn't imply a predator can consume prey of any size. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                     Key Feature
1. Direct Air Capture and Storage (DAC+S)   :   Captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere
2. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)              :   Permanently stores CO2 in geological formations
3. Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) : Uses biomass for energy and stores biogenic carbon geologically
4. Enhanced Weathering                       :   Mines rocks to absorb CO2 naturally
5. CO2-to-Methanol Conversion                :   Converts captured CO2 into methanol fuel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Direct Air Capture and Storage (DAC+S) technology specifically focuses on capturing CO2 directly from the ambient air, unlike other carbon capture methods that capture CO2 at the point of emission.  Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) encompasses a broader range of technologies aimed at removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it durably in various reservoirs, including geological formations. BECCS leverages biomass as an energy source while simultaneously capturing and storing the biogenic carbon released during the energy production process. Enhanced weathering utilizes naturally occurring mineral reactions to sequester atmospheric CO2. Finally, CO2-to-Methanol Conversion is a specific CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) technology that transforms captured CO2 into methanol, a valuable fuel alternative.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  The comprehensive nature of option (d) accurately reflects the technological descriptions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Initiative/Report
1. New Climate Institute                      :   Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)
2. Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy:   Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM)
3.  International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) : Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India
4.  National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)   :  Nature Conservation Index (NCI)
5. Goldman Sonnenfeldt School of Sustainability and Climate Change: Arctic’s Plastic Crisis Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  The Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy is associated with the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), not the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM), which was released by the New Climate Institute in collaboration with Carbon Market Watch.  The International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) was involved in the Arctic’s Plastic Crisis report, not the LULC Atlas, which is produced by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC). The Goldman Sonnenfeldt School of Sustainability and Climate Change released the Nature Conservation Index (NCI). Therefore, option (b) is correct because it identifies the only two accurately paired items. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly match organizations with their initiatives or wrongly state that none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                     Description
1.  Grasshopper Effect                         :   CO2-to-Methanol Conversion
2.  Biocover                                  :  Microbial methane oxidation system for landfill methane control.
3.  Just Transition                             : Greening the economy fairly and inclusively
4.  Superhydrophobic Catalysts                 :  Derived from cellulose, eco-friendly, and withstand water by-products in biodiesel production.
5. Soil Acidification                          :  Loss of soil inorganic carbon (SIC), loss of microbes, increased aluminum toxicity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Biocover is indeed a system utilizing methanotrophic bacteria to control methane emissions. Just Transition accurately describes the fair and inclusive approach to economic greening. Superhydrophobic catalysts are correctly characterized by their biomass origin, eco-friendliness, and ability to withstand water. Soil acidification correctly lists its impacts.  The Grasshopper effect is incorrectly paired with CO2-to-Methanol Conversion; the Grasshopper effect describes the long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants, including plastics and persistent organic pollutants, to the Arctic.  Therefore, option (d) represents the most accurate selection. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, neglecting some of the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Wetland/Area                                  Characteristic/Designation
1. Bhoj Wetland                               :   Designated as a Ramsar site in 2002
2. Banni Grasslands                           :   Located in the Himalayas
3. Western Ghats                             :   Kasturirangan committee report proposed 37% as Eco-sensitive Area
4.  Arctic                                     :   "Hemispheric sink" for plastics and toxic chemicals due to the Grasshopper effect
5.  World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR): Includes 759 sites in 136 countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Bhoj Wetland's Ramsar site designation, the Kasturirangan committee's proposal for the Western Ghats, the Arctic's role as a pollutant sink via the Grasshopper effect, and the WNBR's site count are all factually accurate.  The incorrect pairing is 2, as Banni Grasslands are not located in the Himalayas.  Therefore, option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete or include the incorrectly matched pair involving the Banni Grasslands.  The question tests factual knowledge of environmental designations and phenomena.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Project                                     Focus Area
1. Project Tiger                             :  Conservation of Asiatic Lions
2. Project Elephant                         :  Protection of  Indian Rhinos
3. Project Dolphin                           :  Conservation of Gangetic Dolphins
4. Bustard Recovery Project                 :  Conservation of Great Indian Bustards


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger, initiated in 1973, primarily focuses on the conservation of tigers in India.  Option 1 incorrectly pairs it with Asiatic lion conservation; that is the focus of Project Lion. Project Elephant, launched in 1992, aims to protect elephants and their habitats, not Indian rhinos (which might have other conservation programs). Option 2 is thus incorrect. Project Dolphin, as the name suggests, focuses on the conservation of Gangetic dolphins, making option 3 correct. The Bustard Recovery Project, extended until 2033, specifically targets the conservation of Great Indian Bustards, making option 4 correct. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about these crucial wildlife conservation initiatives.  Understanding the specific mandates of each project is crucial for effective environmental governance and policy-making in India.


**2. With reference to the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

    IDWH Component                                 Description
1. Support to protected areas                    :  Focuses solely on community reserves
2. Protection of wildlife outside protected areas :  Includes habitat restoration in human-dominated landscapes
3. Species recovery programs                     :  Currently covers over 50 critically endangered species


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IDWH scheme encompasses a broader range of activities than suggested in option 1. While support to protected areas is a key component, it includes national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves, not solely focusing on the latter.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. Option 2 correctly identifies that the scheme includes protection of wildlife outside protected areas, encompassing habitat restoration and management in areas with human presence.  This is a crucial aspect of ensuring wildlife survival beyond designated protected areas. Option 3 is incorrect because the text specifies that 22 species have been identified under the Species recovery program so far, not over 50.  Thus, only option 2 accurately reflects a component of the IDWH scheme. The other options reflect either an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the scheme's scope and objectives.


**3. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following pairs:**

    PBR Aspect                                    Characteristic
1. Statutory recognition                         :  Based entirely on local traditions without legal backing
2. Information documented                       :  Excludes traditional knowledge related to biological resources
3. Relevance                                     : Primarily for claiming ownership of intellectual property rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PBR derives its statutory recognition from the Biological Diversity Act of 2002, which mandates its preparation by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in consultation with local communities. This is directly contradicted by option 1, which states that the PBR lacks legal backing.  The PBR explicitly aims to document traditional knowledge associated with local biological resources, including their medicinal and other uses.  Therefore, option 2 is incorrect. While the PBR supports claims of local ownership of biodiversity and traditional knowledge, its relevance extends beyond intellectual property rights. It aids in sustainable resource management and conservation efforts. Option 3 is also incorrect as it is too narrow.  All three options misrepresent key aspects of the PBR. Understanding the PBR's legal basis, information content, and wider relevance is crucial for effective biodiversity conservation and community empowerment.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Environmental Index                                  Characteristic

3.  EPI 2024 and NCI 2024                         : Both indices use identical methodologies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The EPI 2024 uses a comprehensive set of indicators across multiple issue categories, including climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality, not solely focusing on climate change. Option 1 is therefore incorrect.  The NCI 2024 ranked India 176 out of 180 countries, while Estonia topped the list in the EPI 2024; India's ranking was much lower than Estonia's. Option 2 is incorrect.  The EPI and NCI, while both environmental indices, are likely to employ different methodologies and indicator sets tailored to their respective focuses. Therefore, option 3 is also incorrect.  All three options demonstrate a misunderstanding of the scope and methodology of these environmental indices.  Accurate understanding of these indices is vital for comparative analysis of environmental performance across nations.


**5. With reference to Ramsar sites, consider the following pairs:**

    Ramsar Site                                      Location

(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) is primarily involved in remote sensing and the creation of resources like the Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, which focuses on land use patterns, not directly on water conservation.  Option 1 is incorrect. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is indeed involved in collecting the Environment Protection Charge (EPC), making option 2 correct. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) does implement eco-labelling schemes, thus option 3 is correct. The Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) focuses on green building practices and standards, not sustainable agriculture, making option 4 incorrect.  Finally, the Goldman Sonnenfeldt School of Sustainability is the organization responsible for the Nature Conservation Index (NCI), making option 5 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                                 Description

(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Direct Air Capture and Storage (DAC+S) captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere, not just from industrial emissions, making option 1 incorrect. Biocover uses methanotrophic bacteria to convert methane to CO2, thus controlling methane emissions from sources like old dumpsites, making option 2 correct. Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) systems are specifically designed to remove SO2 from the flue gas emissions of coal-fired power plants, making option 3 correct. A Just Energy Transition encompasses a broader goal of economic greening, including job creation and social equity, not just renewable energy adoption; thus option 4 is incorrect.  The International Year of Camelids (2024) aims to raise awareness about the potential of camelids but doesn’t specifically focus on sustainable farming; therefore, option 5 is incorrect.  Consequently, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

    2. Rise in pathogenic fungi                  :  Improved microbial activity
    3. Increased aluminum toxicity              :  Enhanced crop yields
    4. Decreased nutrient availability           :  Loss of soil microbes

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 4 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Soil acidification leads to several detrimental effects.  The loss of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) directly impacts soil structure and fertility, ultimately decreasing nutrient availability.  A rise in pathogenic fungi harms plant health, while increased aluminum toxicity inhibits root growth and nutrient uptake. The correct pairing is therefore 3 and 4. Option 1 is incorrect because SIC loss reduces nutrient availability, not increases it. Option 2 is incorrect as increased pathogenic fungi harm, rather than improve, microbial activity. Option 3 is incorrect because increased aluminum toxicity negatively affects plant growth, not enhances it.  Understanding the negative consequences of soil acidification is crucial for effective soil management practices.


**2. With reference to managing acid soils, consider the following pairs:**

    Method of Acid Soil Management            Suitable Material/Technique

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Liming, a crucial method for managing acid soils, involves incorporating lime, gypsum, or dolomite into the soil. Industrial by-products like press mud, basic slags, and flue dust can also be used to neutralize soil acidity. Growing acid-tolerant crops like sugarcane and bananas is another effective strategy.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 1 is incorrect because press mud is an industrial by-product used for soil amendment, not a primary component of liming. The options are designed to test the knowledge of various methods and materials used in acid soil management, highlighting the diverse approaches available for improving soil health and agricultural productivity.


**3. With reference to the Biocover system and its applications, consider the following pairs:**

    Application of Biocover                     Description

    3.  Methane conversion to CO2              :  Optimal conditions for methanotrophic bacteria
    4.  Use in old dumpsites                    : Covering landfills with an oxidizing layer of mature compost


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biocover is a sustainable system using methanotrophic bacteria to convert methane into CO2, thus controlling fugitive methane emissions.  It involves laying porous material layers on landfills, followed by an oxidizing layer of mature compost.  This system finds applications in old dumpsites and can be used in land reclamation. Road construction is not a direct application of biocover. Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 2 is partially correct as land reclamation can be a secondary benefit, but the core function is methane mitigation.  The question tests knowledge of the Biocover technology, its mechanism, and its applications in environmental remediation.


**4. With reference to the "grasshopper effect" and its characteristics, consider the following pairs:**

    Characteristic of Grasshopper Effect           Description
    1. Accumulation in the Arctic               : Transport via atmospheric and oceanic currents
    2. Global distillation                      :  Plastic and toxic chemicals deposit in lower latitudes
    3. Hemispheric sink                         :  Arctic region acting as a repository for pollutants

    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The grasshopper effect describes the long-range atmospheric transport of pollutants, particularly persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and plastic, from lower latitudes to the Arctic, making the Arctic a “hemispheric sink.”  This process is also known as global distillation.  The report highlighting this phenomenon was released by Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), not Yale Center. Therefore only 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option 2 is incorrect because global distillation describes the movement *to* the Arctic, not from it. Option 4 is incorrect due to the incorrect reporting organization.  The question assesses understanding of the grasshopper effect, its mechanism, and the associated research.


**5. With reference to the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The CPCB is indeed a statutory body functioning under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, making statement 1 correct.  The CGWB plays a crucial role in managing groundwater resources and, by extension, indirectly contributes to water pollution control efforts. Hence, statement 3 is also correct.  However, the NGT receives cases as per orders *issued by itself*, not its own orders.  It's an independent body that adjudicates environmental disputes.  The Committee for Air Quality Management focuses primarily on air quality, and while its work might tangentially relate to broader environmental concerns, its core mandate doesn't encompass the implementation of water pollution legislation.  Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs, highlighting the need for precise understanding of the roles and functions of these environmental organizations.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Bioremediation uses microorganisms like those in Oilzapper and Oilivorous-S to break down oil. Floating booms are physical barriers used to contain oil spills. Skimmers are boats used to collect oil from the water's surface. Sorbents, including materials like straw and volcanic ash, absorb oil.  Therefore, all options except (d) are incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Focus/Goal
1. Sagarmala Programme                     :   Green ports and green shipping
2. Maritime India Vision 2030                :   Port-led development
3. Green Voyage 2050                         :   Support to developing countries to reduce ship emissions
4. Revised Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy by IMO: Net-zero emissions by 2050

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While Sagarmala does include aspects of green ports, its primary focus is port-led development.  Maritime India Vision 2030 aims to improve the maritime sector, including green initiatives, but port-led development is a core element. Green Voyage 2050 correctly focuses on supporting developing countries in emission reduction. The IMO's revised GHG strategy correctly aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly pair initiatives with their focuses.

3. OPRC 1990                             :   Oil pollution preparedness, response, and cooperation
4. UNCLOS                               :   Comprehensive international law for seas and oceans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. MARPOL (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) focuses on preventing pollution from ships. The 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage addresses liability for oil spill damage. OPRC (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation) focuses on preparedness, response, and cooperation regarding oil spills. UNCLOS (UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) provides a comprehensive legal framework for the world's oceans and seas. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Role/Function
1. International Hydrographic Organization (IHO):  Naming of undersea features
2. UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC): Approving names of undersea features
3. National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research: Discovering undersea features in the Indian Ocean
4. Department of Fisheries                     : Promoting artificial reefs under PMMSY

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The IHO plays a crucial role in the standardization and approval of undersea feature names. The IOC, in conjunction with the IHO, approves names for undersea features. The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) has been instrumental in discovering several undersea features, including those recently named in the Indian Ocean. The Department of Fisheries is actively involved in promoting artificial reefs as part of the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY). Therefore, option (c) is correct, encompassing all the correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and, thus, incorrect.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Pre-Monsoon Wind/Shower        Effect/Characteristic
1. Aandhi or Kali Aandhi                 :   Early ripening of mangoes
2. Mango showers                         :   Observed over northwestern and central India
3. Blossom showers                       :   Aid in early ripening of mangoes in coastal Karnataka and Kerala
4. Elephanta winds                       :   Mark the end of the southwest monsoon

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aandhi or Kali Aandhi are strong dust storms, not associated with mango ripening. Mango showers are pre-monsoon rains, accurately described. Blossom showers are pre-monsoon showers in Kerala, not specifically aiding mango ripening in coastal Karnataka and Kerala. Elephanta winds accurately mark the end of the southwest monsoon. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ramsar Site                                    Characteristic
1. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries (Bihar) :   Brackish shallow lake
2. Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary (Tamil Nadu)    :   Large shallow wetland
3. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary (Tamil Nadu)     :   Man-made reservoirs
4. Tawa Reservoir (Madhya Pradesh)         :   Located inside Satpura Tiger Reserve

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nagi and Nakti are man-made reservoirs, not brackish lakes. Nanjarayan is correctly described as a large shallow wetland. Kazhuveli is a brackish lake, not man-made reservoirs. Tawa Reservoir is correctly situated inside Satpura Tiger Reserve. Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain mismatched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Carbon Farming Method                     Description
1. Agroforestry                            :   Minimising soil disturbance
2. Conservation farming                    :   Improving agriculture and restoring ecosystems
3. Integrated nutrient management           :   Regenerative practices to store carbon and reduce emissions
4. Renewable Energy Production              :   Combating climate change by storing carbon

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Agroforestry is not primarily about minimizing soil disturbance; it involves integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural systems. Conservation farming accurately focuses on minimizing soil disturbance. Integrated nutrient management is a component of regenerative practices but isn't the sole definition. Renewable energy production is a method to reduce emissions, but not the primary definition of carbon farming. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain mismatched pairs.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Project                          Agency/Organization

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bustard Recovery Project is correctly implemented by the Wildlife Institute of India.  Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana is correctly associated with the Department of Fisheries.  The National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan is a national-level plan, not specifically under the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change although that ministry has a role. The Crocodile Conservation Project's completion of 50 years is a statement of fact, not a pairing.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched or incomplete pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Headquarters Location
1. IPBES                                          :     Panama City
2.  GEF                                            :     Bonn, Germany
3.  NCPOR                                         :     Washington, D.C.
4.  WWF International                             :     Gland, Switzerland


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was established in Panama City in 2012.  Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has its secretariat in Washington, D.C., not Bonn, Germany.  The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) is located in India, not Washington D.C.  Finally, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) International has its headquarters in Gland, Switzerland.  These incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions. The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern correct information from plausible but incorrect alternatives, demanding accurate knowledge of the headquarters of various international organizations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Scheme                                   Governing Body/Ministry
1. Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
2.  Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)       :   UNFCCC
3.  Renewable Energy Technology Action Partnership (RETAP) :   World Bank
4.  One Million Youth Actions Challenge (1MYAC)    :   UN CC:Learn


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) was launched at COP26 of the UNFCCC. The One Million Youth Actions Challenge (1MYAC) is promoted by the One UN Climate Change Learning Partnership (UN CC:Learn).  Option 3 is incorrect; RETAP is a joint initiative of India and the USA, not the World Bank. This question tests the understanding of the institutional frameworks and governing bodies behind various climate change and environmental initiatives. The inclusion of plausible distractors like the World Bank in relation to RETAP makes the question challenging and necessitates precise knowledge of the involved entities.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Conference/Meeting                                  Outcome/Agreement
1. COP29                                             :   Baku Climate Unity Pact
2.  46th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) :   Madrid Protocol
3.  5th International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) :   Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund
4.  COP27                                             :   Loss and Damage Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

COP29 resulted in the Baku Climate Unity Pact. The 5th International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) led to the establishment of the Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund.  COP27 established the Loss and Damage Fund. Option 2 is incorrect; the Madrid Protocol is an agreement under the Antarctic Treaty System, not a direct outcome of the ATCM meeting itself, though it is relevant to the Treaty’s environmental protection efforts.  This question tests knowledge of significant international environmental agreements and the outcomes of specific conferences. The inclusion of the Madrid Protocol as a distractor necessitates a nuanced understanding of the Antarctic Treaty System and its relationship to the ATCM.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Publication                                 Organization/Publisher
1. Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2024       :   World Economic Forum
2.  The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle :   Global Commission on the Economics of Water
3.  Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs)           :   UNFCCC
4.  India’s Sixth Assessment Report                  :   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Economic Forum published the Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2024 report. The Global Commission on the Economics of Water released its report, "The Economics of Water." Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) are submitted under the UNFCCC's Enhanced Transparency Framework. Option 4 is incorrect; India does not produce its own separate assessment reports under the IPCC framework.  Instead, it contributes to the IPCC's global assessment reports. This question assesses the ability to link reports and publications to their originating organizations. The inclusion of the plausible but ultimately incorrect option related to India’s IPCC reports adds to the question's difficulty.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fund/Mechanism                                    Administering Body/Source
1. Green Climate Fund (GCF)                         :   Developed Countries
2.  Adaptation Fund                                 :   Kyoto Protocol
3.  Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)           :   World Bank
4.  Fund to Respond to Loss and Damage (FrLD)      :   Philippines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is funded by developed countries. The Adaptation Fund receives a share of proceeds from the new market-based UNFCCC mechanism established by Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. The Fund to Respond to Loss and Damage (FrLD) is hosted by the Philippines. Option 3 is incorrect; while the LDCF is administered by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the GEF itself is a partnership of multiple agencies including the World Bank, not solely the World Bank. This question tests understanding of the financial mechanisms under the UNFCCC and their sources of funding.  The inclusion of the World Bank as a partially correct yet ultimately incorrect answer for the LDCF makes this question challenging.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) : Launched at COP27
2. ILO Guidelines for a Just Transition       : Adopted in 2020
3. ‘Just Transition for All’ initiative        : By the UN

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) was indeed launched at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, not COP27.  This makes option 1 incorrect in its current form. The ILO Guidelines for a Just Transition were adopted in 2015, not 2020, rendering option 2 incorrect. The ‘Just Transition for All’ initiative is a World Bank initiative, not a UN initiative, thus option 3 is also false. Therefore, only option (a) is partially correct, as the JETP is a real initiative, although the year is incorrect. The other pairs contain factual inaccuracies. The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle errors in seemingly plausible statements.  A candidate needs to possess precise knowledge of the initiatives and their timelines to answer correctly. The distractors are designed to exploit potential misconceptions about the timing and the organizations involved in these climate-related initiatives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Climate Change Initiative                     Location of Secretariat
1. Global Environment Facility (GEF)           : Bonn, Germany
2. Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) : Washington, D.C. (US)
3. Antarctic Treaty Secretariat                :  Panama City

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has its secretariat in Washington, D.C., not Bonn, Germany.  The IPBES secretariat is located in Bonn, Germany. The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat is located in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Option 1 is incorrect due to the mismatched secretariat location for the GEF. Option 3 is incorrect because of the incorrect location for the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat. Only the pairing of IPBES with its correct secretariat location in Bonn makes option (b) correct. This question tests factual recall of the locations of key international environmental organizations. The distractors highlight the ease with which one might confuse the locations of similar organizations, demanding precise knowledge for a correct answer.


**3. With reference to the Energy Transition Index (ETI), consider the following pairs:**

Rank in ETI 2024                 Country
1. 63rd                              : Sweden
2. Top 5 Performer                  : India
3. Among top 20 G20 performers    : Brazil

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's rank in the ETI 2024 was 63rd, not Sweden. Sweden was among the top 5 performers. Brazil was among the top 20 G20 performers.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall concerning the Energy Transition Index rankings and the performance of specific countries.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge of the rankings and the ability to differentiate between a country's rank and its overall performance category.  The question requires precise knowledge and the ability to distinguish between different performance metrics within the index.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Climate Change Fund/Initiative          Key Characteristic
1. Loss and Damage Fund (LDF)           : Established during COP26
2. Green Climate Fund (GCF)             : Aims to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020
3. Adaptation Fund                       : Receives 5% share of proceeds from Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Loss and Damage Fund was established during COP27, not COP26. The Green Climate Fund's goal of mobilizing US$100 billion per year by 2020 is accurate. The Adaptation Fund does receive a 5% share of proceeds from Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of the key characteristics and establishment years of major climate finance mechanisms. The distractors play on the similarities between the funds and the potential for confusion regarding their establishment years and specific goals.  The question assesses knowledge of the intricacies of international climate finance mechanisms.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                  Focus Area
1.  World Wildlife Fund (WWF)                 :  Supports community-led conservation initiatives
2.  Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI)    :  Develops standards for corporate climate targets
3.  Climate Policy Initiative (CPI)              :  Focuses on reducing mercury use in gold mining

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WWF's focus is broader than just community-led initiatives; it encompasses a wide range of conservation efforts. The SBTi accurately focuses on developing standards for corporate climate targets. The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) does not focus on mercury reduction in gold mining; that is a focus of the Global Environment Facility's PlanetGOLD initiative. Only pairs 1 and 2 accurately reflect the primary focus areas of the organizations.  This question tests the ability to differentiate between the specific mandates of various environmental organizations.  The distractors are designed to challenge understanding of the nuanced roles of these organizations, demanding a precise understanding of their activities.


**1. With reference to international environmental agreements, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement                                      Key Feature
    1. Antarctic Treaty                               :   Established in 1991
    2. Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources :   Signed by India
    3. Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals          :   Entered into force in 1961
    4. Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol) :  Applicability extends south of 60° South latitude

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Antarctic Treaty was signed in 1959 and entered into force in 1961, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources was ratified by India, and its applicability extends to the area south of 60° South latitude, making statements 2 and 4 correct.  The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, while a significant agreement related to Antarctica, was not part of the original Antarctic Treaty and did not enter into force in 1961. Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of key international environmental agreements related to Antarctica, their timelines, and India's involvement.  The distractors include the incorrect dates and the conflation of different agreements to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of these treaties.

**2. With reference to organizations involved in environmental governance, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Key Function/Initiative
    1. Global Environment Facility (GEF)           :   Funds the Great Green Wall initiative
    2. Climate Policy Initiative (CPI)               :   Operated by ISRO
    3. National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) Programme : Releases the Global Landscape of Climate Finance report
    4. Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI)      :  Partners include the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GEF does indeed fund the Great Green Wall initiative, making statement 1 correct.  The SBTI's partners include the WWF, making statement 4 correct.  The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) releases the Global Landscape of Climate Finance report, not the NICES Programme, which is operated by ISRO and the Department of Space, making statements 2 and 3 incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's familiarity with various environmental organizations, their roles, and their key initiatives.  The distractors are carefully selected to be plausible but incorrect, requiring a precise understanding of each organization's function. The correct answer requires specific knowledge of the mandates and activities of each organization.

**3. With reference to environmental reporting and indices, consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                  Key Feature

    2. Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 :   Ranks countries based on their engagement with the UN system
    3. Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024       :   India ranked 176th
    4. Sustainable Development Report 2024      :   Finland ranked first

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index 2023-24 is released by NITI Aayog, not the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, making statement 1 incorrect. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 ranks countries on environmental performance, not on UN engagement; the New Index of Support to UN-based Multilateralism (UN-Mi) does that. The Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024 did rank India 176th, and the Sustainable Development Report 2024 did rank Finland first.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various environmental indices and reports, their key features, and the rankings of countries. The distractors are designed to test for precise knowledge of the reporting entities and ranking methodologies.


**4. With reference to initiatives related to waste and chemical management, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                     Key Aspect

**Explanation:**

The Chipko movement, while having many leaders including Sunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt, is most strongly associated with Amrita Devi Bishnoi's historical actions in the 18th century that predated the 1970s movement in Reni village.  The Bishnoi community's commitment to tree preservation is foundational to the Chipko movement's philosophy.  The Silent Valley Movement was primarily against a hydroelectric project and while Sunderlal Bahuguna was involved in many environmental movements, he wasn't the primary leader of Silent Valley. The Appiko movement, inspired by the Chipko movement, was led by Panduranga Hegde in Karnataka, not Medha Patkar. Medha Patkar is famously known for leading the Narmada Bachao Andolan.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly associate leaders with movements they did not primarily lead, demonstrating a lack of precision in understanding the key figures involved in these critical environmental struggles. The question tests the ability to differentiate between prominent figures within different environmental movements and understand the historical context of each.

The Chipko movement, a non-violent resistance against deforestation, is strongly associated with Sunderlal Bahuguna, who played a crucial role in its leadership and popularization.  Pandurang Hegde led the Appiko movement, a similar environmental movement in Karnataka's Western Ghats, emphasizing the protection of forests. Medha Patkar spearheaded the Narmada Bachao Andolan, a long-running campaign against the construction of large dams on the Narmada River.  The Silent Valley Movement, while lacking a single prominent leader in the same way as the others, was a significant environmental protest against the construction of a hydroelectric dam in Kerala.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option 4 is incorrect as the provided options do not list a prominent figure for the Silent Valley movement. This question tests factual recall of key figures associated with major Indian environmental movements, demonstrating an understanding of the historical context of environmental activism in India. The inclusion of a distractor (option 4) increases the difficulty level and requires precise knowledge.

(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chipko movement, a non-violent resistance against deforestation, prominently featured Sunderlal Bahuguna as a leader.  The Appiko movement in Karnataka's Western Ghats was spearheaded by Panduranga Hegde, mirroring the Chipko movement's focus on forest conservation.  The Narmada Bachao Andolan, a movement against large dam construction on the Narmada river, was led by Medha Patkar.  Amrita Devi Bishnoi's actions in the 18th century, while a precursor to later movements, are not directly associated with the leadership of the movements listed. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link leaders with movements they did not lead, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the specific individuals and their roles in these significant environmental movements. The question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the leaders associated with each movement, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge of Indian environmental history for UPSC aspirants.


**2. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The highest peak in the Western Ghats is Anamudi, not the Palghat Gap, which is a pass.  The Sahyadri is a regional name for the Western Ghats in Maharashtra, not in Kerala and Tamil Nadu (where they are known as Nilgiri and Anaimalai/Cardamom hills respectively). The Western Ghats have a diverse range of forest types including evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, and dry deciduous, making option 3 incorrect. The Western Ghats were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012, not 2011. All pairs are incorrectly matched, highlighting the necessity for precise knowledge of geographical features and their attributes.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, demanding a nuanced understanding of the Western Ghats' diverse characteristics, a crucial aspect for geography-related questions in the UPSC exam.

2. High Level Working Group (HLWG)       :  Partial designation of Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area
3.  National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) : Funding the Bustard Recovery Project
4.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):  Implementation of the SEEA framework


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), or Madhav Gadgil Committee, recommended designating the entire Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area, not just undergrounding power lines. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) modified the WGEEP recommendations, resulting in a partial designation of the Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area. CAMPA indeed funds the Bustard Recovery Project. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is not directly involved in the implementation of the SEEA framework; that responsibility lies with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The incorrect options demonstrate the need for precise understanding of the roles and recommendations of various environmental bodies and committees, crucial for answering environment-related questions in the UPSC exam.  This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills regarding environmental governance in India.

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rare Earth Elements are explicitly mentioned as components of Critical Energy Transition Minerals (CETMs), making pair 1 correct.  Graphite is a component of biomass briquettes, thus pair 5 is also correct.  Copper is not a component of biomass briquettes; biomass briquettes are composed of organic materials like agricultural residues, forestry wastes, or waste biomass. Selenium is used in superhydrophobic catalysts, which are derived from biomass, but it's not a primary component of the catalysts themselves; the catalysts utilize biomass for their structure. Cadmium is not directly related to BRSR components; BRSR focuses on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects, and while cadmium's environmental impact might be a consideration in some companies' ESG reporting, it is not a core component.

**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of various international organizations and their roles in environmental conservation and disaster management, specifically concerning glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and broader environmental initiatives. Let's examine each pair:

1. **ICIMOD and Global Climate Observing System:** ICIMOD is indeed involved in the Himalayan cryosphere, but its primary initiative is the HKH cryosphere initiative, not the Global Climate Observing System. The Global Climate Observing System is a broader initiative encompassing various aspects of climate monitoring and early warning systems.  Therefore, this pairing is incorrect.

2. **UNESCO and HKH cryosphere initiative:** While UNESCO works on mountain ecosystems and climate change, the HKH cryosphere initiative is primarily associated with ICIMOD.  UNESCO's involvement might be collaborative or through related programs, but it's not the primary driver of this specific initiative.  Therefore, this pairing is incorrect.

3. **UNSD, UNEP, and Secretariat of CBD and Sendai Framework:** The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is a UN initiative, but it's not directly associated with UNSD, UNEP, and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in a singular, primary relationship.  While these organizations work on disaster risk reduction and environmental aspects, the Sendai Framework has a broader governance structure. This pairing is incorrect.

All pairings are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary affiliations and focuses of these international organizations and their related initiatives.  A correct pairing might involve ICIMOD with the HKH cryosphere initiative, UNESCO with its Climate Change and Mountain Ecosystem Programme, and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) with the Sendai Framework.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of organization-initiative linkages.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of various Indian agencies and their roles in environmental monitoring and regulation. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **NRSC and EnviStats India:**  While NRSC contributes data relevant to EnviStats (through its land use and land cover data), the compilation of EnviStats India is primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).  This pairing is incorrect, highlighting the distinction between data providers and the final compiler of environmental statistics.

2. **CPCB and Implementation of EPC:** The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is indeed responsible for the implementation of the Environment Protection Charge (EPC), a key policy instrument for environmental protection in India. This pairing is correct.

3. **MoSPI and Development of LULC Atlas:** The development of the Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India is the responsibility of the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not MoSPI. MoSPI might utilize the data from the atlas, but the creation itself is done by NRSC. This pairing is incorrect.

Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.  The question demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of various governmental and scientific agencies in environmental management.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring careful consideration of each agency's specific functions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of various environmental technologies and their applications. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Bioremediation and Rain Gauges:** Bioremediation uses living organisms for environmental cleanup, specifically mentioned for oil spills.  The description of using rain gauges is related to CoS-it-FloWS, not bioremediation. This pairing is incorrect.

2. **CoS-it-FloWS and Oil Contaminants:** CoS-it-FloWS is a flood forecasting system, not related to oil spill cleanup.  The description of using living organisms to remove oil contaminants applies to bioremediation. This pairing is incorrect.

3. **CCUS and Methanol Production:** Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) focuses on capturing CO2, not directly on converting waste to methanol. While methanol production might utilize captured CO2, it's not the primary function of CCUS.  The description of converting coal and waste to methanol is related to a separate initiative within India's methanol economy program. This pairing is incorrect.

All three pairings are incorrect because they misrepresent the core functions and applications of each technology or initiative. The question emphasizes the need for a precise understanding of environmental technologies and their specific uses. The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring careful consideration of each technology's purpose and application.

Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative             Location of Secretariat/Headquarters
1. IPBES                               :   Panama City
2. UN-REDD                              :   Bonn, Germany
3. International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) : Washington, D.C. (US)
4.  GEF                                  :   Monaco

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was established in Panama City in 2012.  While the UN Environment Programme provides secretariat services to IPBES, its headquarters is not in Bonn.  The UN-REDD Programme's secretariat is located in Bonn, Germany, focusing on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) has its secretariat in Monaco, not Washington D.C. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) secretariat is in Washington, D.C.  Therefore, only the pairing of IPBES with Panama City is correct. The other options present incorrect pairings due to confusion between the location of secretariat services and the actual headquarters or the incorrect assignment of headquarters locations.  Understanding the difference between a secretariat's location and an organization's headquarters is crucial for accurate analysis.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Program       Key Focus Area
1. Small Grants Programme (SGP)       :   Ocean and marine biodiversity conservation
2. Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) : Supporting adaptation projects in vulnerable nations
3. Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)  :   Addressing climate variability
4. PlanetGOLD                           :   Reducing mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Small Grants Programme (SGP) supports community-led initiatives in conservation, not specifically ocean and marine biodiversity.  The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) accurately reflect their focus on adaptation in vulnerable nations and addressing climate variability, respectively. PlanetGOLD's aim is to reduce mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Option (c) correctly identifies the accurate pairings of LDCF, SCCF, and PlanetGOLD with their respective focus areas.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings due to a misunderstanding of the SGP's broad scope and the misattribution of focus areas to other initiatives.  A thorough understanding of each initiative's specific goals is necessary to correctly match them to their key focus areas.


**3. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), consider the following pairs:**

   ESZ Classification                  Characteristic
1. ESZ1 (very high sensitivity)       :   Moderate sensitivity
2. ESZ2 (high sensitivity)           :   High sensitivity
3. ESZ3 (moderate sensitivity)       :   Very high sensitivity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Western Ghats Eco-sensitive Zone is divided into three zones based on sensitivity: ESZ1 (very high sensitivity), ESZ2 (high sensitivity), and ESZ3 (moderate sensitivity).  Only the pairing of ESZ2 with high sensitivity is correct.  The other options incorrectly assign sensitivity levels to the zones.  Option (b) correctly reflects the sensitivity level assigned to ESZ2. This question tests the understanding of the classification system used for ESZs and requires precise recall of the sensitivity levels assigned to each zone.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between the different levels of sensitivity.

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index 2023-24 measures progress on 113 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework, not all 17 SDGs directly. The Sustainable Development Report 2024 is published by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), not NITI Aayog. The SDGs – National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report, 2024, accurately tracks national progress on SDGs. The New Index of Support to UN-based Multilateralism (UN-Mi) ranks countries based on their engagement with the UN system, not solely on economic growth.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to Climate Change Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                       Key Characteristic
1. Climate Policy Initiative (CPI)                 :  Focuses solely on carbon offsetting
2. Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI)        :  Develops standards for corporate climate targets
3. National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM)       :  Has a budgetary outlay of ₹10,000 crore
4. INTERACT                                     :  A project of large network of research stations focused on the Arctic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) has a broader focus than solely carbon offsetting; it analyzes climate finance and policy. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) accurately develops standards for corporate climate targets. The National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) indeed has a significant budgetary outlay, although the exact figure might vary slightly from the one mentioned (₹19,744 crore). INTERACT is accurately described as a network of Arctic research stations. Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are largely correct. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect pair (CPI).


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Location of Headquarters/Establishment
1. IPBES                                          :   Panama City
2. International Solar Alliance                 :   Paris
3. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)         :   Rome
4.  Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH):   Ministry of Environment, India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was established in Panama City in 2012.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is headquartered in Paris, France. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), a joint body of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), has its headquarters in Rome, Italy. The Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, and doesn't have a specific physical headquarters location, but operates under the Ministry's purview.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Body                           Legal Basis/Act
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)    :   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)             :   National Green Tribunal Act, 2010
3.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)       :   Environment (Protection) Act, 1986


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.  The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) does not directly operate under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. While its functions are related to environmental protection, its establishment and functioning are governed by separate regulations and administrative frameworks within the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Report                           Focus/Recommendation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Kasturirangan Committee report recommended designating approximately 37% of the Western Ghats as an Eco-Sensitive Area (ESA). The Madhav Gadgil Committee report proposed dividing the Western Ghats into three zones based on varying degrees of ecological sensitivity. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG), headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, further suggested a color-coding system for industries operating within the Western Ghats region to regulate development based on their environmental impact.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative         Key Provision/Focus Area
1. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)  :   Conservation of biological diversity
2.  BBNJ Agreement                         :    Marine Genetic Resources (MGR) beyond national jurisdiction
3.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)       :   Prohibition of chemical weapons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) focuses on the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. The Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement addresses the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, with a significant focus on marine genetic resources (MGRs) and benefit-sharing. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) aims to eliminate chemical weapons and prevent their proliferation. All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

3.  EnviStats India 2024                    :   Provides data on energy accounts, ocean accounts, soil nutrient index, and biodiversity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) assesses countries' performance across various environmental indicators, including climate change metrics. The Nature Conservation Index (NCI) specifically ranks countries based on their performance in nature conservation.  EnviStats India 2024 presents comprehensive environmental statistics, encompassing energy, ocean, soil, and biodiversity data.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Climate Change Initiative                     Key Feature/Objective
1.  Global Environment Facility (GEF)          :   Supports community-led conservation initiatives through the Small Grants Programme (SGP)
2.  Green Climate Fund (GCF)                 :   Established to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries' NDCs
3.  Adaptation Fund                           :   Receives a share of proceeds from Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement
4.  Loss and Damage Fund (FrLD)             :    Provides financial assistance to vulnerable countries for climate change impacts, operationalized in COP28
5.  Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)   :    Assists Least Developed Country Parties for National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Global Environment Facility (GEF) does indeed support community-led conservation initiatives through its Small Grants Programme (SGP). The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established with the stated aim of mobilizing US$100 billion annually by 2020 to assist developing countries in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Adaptation Fund receives a percentage of the proceeds generated through the market-based mechanism established under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. The Loss and Damage Fund (FrLD), established at COP27 and operationalized at COP28, provides financial assistance to vulnerable countries to address losses and damages resulting from climate change. Finally, the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) specifically assists Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in developing and implementing their National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs).  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Treaty             Provision/Outcome
1.  Antarctic Treaty                           :   Prohibits military deployments in Antarctica
2.  Paris Agreement (Article 6)              :   Establishes a centralized approach for carbon trading (Article 6.4)
3.  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources :   Ratified by India
4.  Kyoto Protocol                            :   Includes only developed countries (Annex I) in its initial scope
5.  Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement (High Seas Treaty):   Is an international legally binding treaty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Antarctic Treaty explicitly prohibits military activities in Antarctica.  Article 6 of the Paris Agreement includes a centralized approach for international carbon trading (Article 6.4). The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources has been ratified by India. The Kyoto Protocol, in its initial phase, focused solely on developed countries (Annex I countries).  The High Seas Treaty (BBNJ) is a legally binding international agreement.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   UNFCCC COP Outcome/Initiative            Characteristic/Goal
1.  New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG)   :   Aims to triple climate finance to USD 300 billion annually by 2035
2.  Baku Climate Unity Pact                  :   Includes finalized rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
3.  Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)  :   Establishes a system for countries to report on climate actions
4.  Reducing Methane from Organic Waste      :   Involves setting sectoral targets to reduce methane emissions
5.  Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge :   Sets a target for deploying 1,500 GW of energy storage globally by 2030

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The NCQG aims to significantly increase climate finance. The ETF is designed for transparent reporting on climate actions. The initiative to reduce methane from organic waste sets sectoral targets for emission reduction. The Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge sets ambitious targets for energy storage deployment. However, while the Baku Climate Unity Pact did encompass several agreements, including those related to Article 6,  it's not solely defined by the finalization of Article 6 rules.  Therefore, pair 2 is not a completely accurate match. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they do not include all the correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurately matched pair 2.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Mechanism Related to Climate Change   Description/Feature
1.  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)  :   Include targets and measures for reducing GHG emissions
2.  Global Stocktake (GST)                    :   A process for evaluating collective progress towards Paris Agreement goals
3.  Just Transition                            :   Involves protecting workers' rights in the shift to low-carbon economies
4.  Energy Transition Index (ETI)              :   Evaluates countries' energy systems and ranks them accordingly
5.  Corresponding Adjustment (Article 6.2)     :   Reflects changes in a country's emissions levels due to ITMO trading

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are accurately matched. NDCs represent countries' commitments to climate action, including emission reduction targets. The Global Stocktake assesses collective progress toward the goals of the Paris Agreement.  A just transition emphasizes safeguarding workers' rights during the shift to a low-carbon economy. The Energy Transition Index ranks countries based on their energy system performance.  Corresponding adjustments under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement account for changes in a country's emissions due to the trading of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on environment-related topics.  Each question adheres to the specified format and includes a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Agreement                      Key Feature/Focus
1.  Kyoto Protocol                          :   Introduced carbon trading
2.  Paris Agreement Article 6.2            :   Centralized approach to carbon market
3.  Sendai Framework                       :   Seven targets for disaster risk reduction
4.  Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+) :   Flagship initiative of the European Union focusing on climate change in developing countries
5.  Baku Climate Unity Pact                 :   Tripling climate finance to USD 300 billion annually by 2035

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, introduced mechanisms for carbon trading as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) sets out seven targets to substantially reduce disaster losses.  The Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA+) is indeed a flagship initiative of the European Union aimed at supporting developing countries in addressing climate change. The Baku Climate Unity Pact, while aiming to increase climate finance, doesn't specify tripling it to USD 300 billion annually by 2035; the target mentioned was for efforts to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually by 2035.  Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement focuses on a decentralized approach to international cooperation on mitigation, not a centralized one. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to climate finance and international agreements, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Goal/Mechanism                 Associated Agreement/Initiative
1.  $1.3 trillion annually by 2035        :   India's proposal at COP29 under NCQG
2.  $100 billion annually (previous goal) :   New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG)
3.  USD 300 billion annually by 2035      :   Baku Climate Unity Pact
4.  Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) :   India's compliance and offset mechanisms for GHG emissions
5.  Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme:   Transitioning gradually to CCTS compliance mechanism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five pairs


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India did propose a goal of $1.3 trillion annually under the NCQG at COP29.  The CCTS incorporates both compliance and offset mechanisms for GHG emissions. The PAT scheme is indeed transitioning to the CCTS compliance mechanism.  However, the previous goal for climate finance was $100 billion annually and is not directly linked to NCQG in the way the question implies. The Baku Climate Unity Pact aimed for efforts to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, not USD 300 billion.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative      Focus Area
1.  International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) :   Global cooperative movement
2.  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) :   Regulating the supply of oil to the world market
3.  International Labour Organization (ILO) :   Just Energy Transition principles
4.  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) :   International carbon markets under Article 6
5.  World Economic Forum                     :   Energy Transition Index (ETI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ICA unites and serves cooperatives worldwide. OPEC's main objective is regulating global oil supply. The ILO's work includes promoting principles of just energy transition. The UNFCCC is central to international climate negotiations, including the rules for carbon markets under Article 6. The World Economic Forum publishes the Energy Transition Index.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India's climate actions and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                       Specific Goal/Objective
1.  National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture :   Promote agroforestry and micro-irrigation
2.  Green Climate Fund (GCF)                :   Supports community-led conservation initiatives
3.  Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):   Imposed by the EU on imports from countries with less stringent climate policies
4.  National Resource Accounts for India      :   Mandated by the National Statistical Office under MoSPI
5.  Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) :   Launched at COP26 of UNFCCC


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture aims to promote practices like agroforestry and micro-irrigation. The National Statistical Office under MoSPI is indeed mandated with the development of National Resource Accounts for India.  The JETP was launched at COP26. However, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) supports climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, not specifically community-led conservation initiatives, although such projects may be funded.  The CBAM is an EU policy, not an Indian initiative or program.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Treaty/Convention                         Key Provision/Focus
1.  Antarctic Treaty                          :   Peaceful use of Antarctica
2.  Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals:   Conservation of Antarctic marine living resources
3.  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources:   Protection of Antarctic seals
4.  Madrid Protocol                          :   Environmental protection in Antarctica
5.  Baku Road Map                           :   Outcome of COP29, focusing on adaptation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All five pairs


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Antarctic Treaty ensures Antarctica's peaceful use. The Madrid Protocol focuses on environmental protection in Antarctica. The Baku Road Map, an outcome of COP29, addresses adaptation. However, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals specifically targets seal conservation, while the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources focuses on broader marine life conservation. Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**1. With reference to Fungi, consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic/Significance                     Example/Organization
1.  Cell wall component                           :   Penicillin
2.  Mode of nutrition                             :   Mycorrhizal associations
3.  Role in ecosystem                             :   Global Fungal Red List Initiative
4.  International Organization focusing on Fungi  :   Heterotrophic (Saprophytic)
5.  Country with Fungi conservation in its law     :   Chile

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because it accurately matches the characteristics and significance of fungi with their respective examples and organizations. Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 2:** Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, meaning they obtain their nutrients from other organisms.  Saprophytic fungi are a type of heterotroph that obtains nutrients from dead organic matter. Mycorrhizal associations are a mutually beneficial relationship between fungi and plant roots, where the fungi help the plant absorb nutrients and water, and the plant provides the fungi with carbohydrates.  Therefore, this pair is correctly matched.

* **Pair 3:** Fungi play a crucial role in ecosystems as decomposers, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients. The Global Fungal Red List Initiative is an organization that assesses the conservation status of fungal species, highlighting their importance in biodiversity. Hence, the pair is correctly matched.

* **Pair 5:** Chile is indeed a unique case among countries as it specifically includes fungi in its legislation for conservation, demonstrating a forward-thinking approach to biodiversity protection.

Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrectly matched. Penicillin is an antibiotic *derived* from a fungus (Penicillium), not a component of the fungal cell wall.  The cell wall component of fungi is chitin.  The Global Fungal Red List Initiative is an organization, not a role fungi play in the ecosystem.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**2. With reference to the IUCN Red List, consider the following pairs:**

   Species                                         Updated Status
1.  La Gomera giant lizard (Gallotia bravoana)     :   Critically Endangered
2.  Copiapoa cacti                               :   Endangered
3.  Bornean Elephant                             :   Least Concern
4.  Gran Canaria giant lizard                      :   Endangered
5.  Ibiza wall lizard                             :   Near Threatened


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only the Gran Canaria giant lizard's updated status is correctly matched.  Let's examine why the other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The La Gomera giant lizard's status was *upgraded* from Critically Endangered to Endangered, not the other way around.

* **Pair 2:** While a significant percentage of Copiapoa cacti species are at risk, the overall statement that *all* Copiapoa cacti are endangered is inaccurate.  The IUCN Red List categorizes species individually, not entire genera.

* **Pair 3:** The Bornean elephant is classified as Endangered, not Least Concern.  This reflects the significant threats to its population.

* **Pair 5:** The Ibiza wall lizard's status was upgraded to Endangered, not remaining Near Threatened.

Therefore, only pair 4 correctly reflects the updated IUCN Red List status, making option (d) the only accurate choice. The other options present incorrect pairings, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of the IUCN Red List updates.


**3. With reference to the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC), consider the following pairs:**

   Objective/Feature                                    Detail
1.  Goal for additional funding by 2034               :   US$ 500 million
2.  Key focus area                                    :   Financial strategies
3.  Supporting Organization                           :   World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
4.  Host Government                                  :   Bhutan government
5.  Type of initiative                               :   International collaboration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer because it accurately identifies the host government and the collaborative nature of the SFTLC.  Let's analyze the other pairs:

* **Pair 1:** The SFTLC aimed to mobilize US$1 billion in additional funding by 2034, not US$500 million.

* **Pair 2:** While financial strategies are a component, the SFTLC's focus extends beyond just that to encompass broader conservation efforts and partnerships.

* **Pair 3:**  The Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC), not the WWF, is the supporting organization.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific organizations involved in international conservation initiatives.

The SFTLC's success hinges on international cooperation, making Pair 5 correctly matched.  Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are accurately matched, leading to option (c) as the correct answer.  The other options contain inaccurate pairings, showcasing the need for precise knowledge of the event's details.


**4. With reference to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic/Impact                             Example/Regulation
1.  Chemical degradation resistance                 :   Stockholm Convention
2.  Primary source                                  :   Pesticides
3.  Health impact                                   :   Increased risk of asthma
4.  Key physical property                           :   High water solubility
5.  Replacement POPs                               :   Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Let's break down each pair:

* **Pair 1:** POPs are indeed resistant to chemical degradation, a key characteristic that contributes to their persistence in the environment. The Stockholm Convention is the international treaty designed to regulate POPs.

* **Pair 2:** Pesticides are a significant source of POPs.  Many older pesticides contained POPs, leading to widespread environmental contamination.

* **Pair 3:**  POPs are linked to various health problems, including an increased risk of asthma.  Their endocrine-disrupting properties contribute to these adverse health outcomes.

Pairs 4 and 5 are incorrect. POPs are characterized by *low* water solubility, not high.  DDT is a *classic* example of a POP, but it is not a replacement POP; rather, it is a POP that has been largely phased out due to its harmful effects, leading to the emergence of other, sometimes more harmful, replacement chemicals.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.  Only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**5. With reference to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), consider the following pairs:**

   Cause/Factor                                   Example/Initiative
1.  Geological cause                              :   National Disaster Management Authority Guidelines
2.  Morphological cause                           :   Excessive precipitation
3.  Physical cause                                :   Mass movement into glacial lakes
4.  Mitigation initiative                         :   Review of dam design floods by CWC
5.  Region with significant GLOF risk            :   Ladakh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 1, 4, and 5 accurately represent causes and mitigation efforts related to GLOFs.  Let's analyze each pair:

* **Pair 1:** Geological causes, such as earthquakes or moraine dam breaches, can trigger GLOFs.

* **Pair 4:** The Central Water Commission (CWC) plays a vital role in reviewing the design flood capacity of dams in areas vulnerable to GLOFs, a crucial mitigation strategy.

* **Pair 5:** Ladakh is one of the regions in India experiencing a high risk of GLOFs due to the presence of numerous glacial lakes.

Pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched. While excessive precipitation is a contributing factor, it's not a *morphological* cause; it's a *physical* cause. Mass movement into glacial lakes is a morphological cause, not a physical one. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  Only option (c) correctly identifies the accurate pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP)          Characteristic
1. DDT                                         :   Detected at high levels in human milk samples since 2004
2. PFAS                                        :   Replacement POP due to similar properties to DDT
3. Dieldrin                                     :   Resistant to photolytic, biological and chemical degradation
4. Heptachlor                                  :   High water solubility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement about DDT's presence in human milk samples is partially true, but the question specifies "detected at high levels *since* 2004," which is incorrect.  DDT levels have decreased significantly since 2004.  PFAS are indeed replacement POPs due to their similar properties, making statement 2 correct. Dieldrin and Heptachlor are examples of POPs known for their resistance to degradation; however, Heptachlor's high water solubility is incorrect; it's actually characterized by low water solubility.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is partially accurate but not entirely correct according to the provided information. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of PFAS. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate statement about DDT levels and the incorrect characteristic of Heptachlor.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern nuanced differences in scientific data.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical/Substance                          Use/Impact
1. DCPA (Dacthal)                             :   Used on onion crops
2. Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate         :   Banned by the U.S. EPA
3.  Press mud                                 :   Industrial by-product used in managing acid soils
4. Flue dust                                   :   Contributes to soil acidification

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

DCPA (Dacthal) is indeed used on crops like onions, and it is correctly identified as a weed-killing pesticide banned by the U.S. EPA.  Press mud, a by-product of the sugarcane industry, is used to manage acid soils. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Flue dust, while an industrial by-product, is not directly stated to contribute to soil acidification in the provided context; thus, statement 4 is not definitively matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct pairings or include an incorrect one.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly link chemicals with their uses and impacts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Methane Mitigation Technique             Application
1. Biocover                                  :   Control of fugitive methane emissions from old dumpsites
2. Microbial methane oxidation system        :   Road construction
3. Porous material layers                     :   Land reclamation
4. Oxidizing layer of mature compost        :   Conversion of methane to CO2

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biocover, a microbial methane oxidation system, is specifically designed to control fugitive methane emissions from old dumpsites.  While biocovers utilize porous material layers and an oxidizing layer of mature compost, these components are not independent applications themselves.  Road construction and land reclamation are potential applications mentioned in the context of biocover's broader use, but they are not direct matches to the specific techniques.  Therefore, only pair 1 is a perfectly matched pair.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrect pairings or overstate the direct applications of the listed techniques.  This question tests the ability to understand the application of specific environmental technologies and accurately match them with their respective uses.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Arctic Pollution Phenomenon                Description
1. Grasshopper effect                        :   Global distillation
2. Hemispheric sink                          :   Accumulation of plastics and toxic chemicals in the Arctic
3. Global distillation                        :   Transport on atmospheric and oceanic currents
4.  Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) :   Released a report on Arctic plastic pollution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The grasshopper effect is indeed described as a process of global distillation, where pollutants are transported long distances before deposition. The Arctic acts as a hemispheric sink, accumulating pollutants from lower latitudes.  Global distillation is accurately described as transport via atmospheric and oceanic currents. ACAT was involved in releasing a report on Arctic pollution, but it’s not the only organization involved.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of global distillation. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the grasshopper effect. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes an incomplete description of ACAT's role.  This question tests knowledge of environmental phenomena and their descriptions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Glacial Lake Feature                     Description
1. Moraine-dammed lake                     :   Water dammed by ice
2. Ice-dammed lake                         :   Water dammed by moraine
3. GLOF                                     :   Sudden release of water from a glacial lake
4.  Chorabari glacial lake                  :   Site of a 2013 GLOF event in Uttarakhand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A moraine-dammed lake is formed by a moraine (material deposited by a glacier), while an ice-dammed lake is formed by ice.  The definitions in pairs 1 and 2 are therefore reversed.  A GLOF (Glacial Lake Outburst Flood) is correctly defined as a sudden release of water. The Chorabari glacial lake is correctly identified as the site of a 2013 GLOF event.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the reversed definitions of moraine-dammed and ice-dammed lakes.  The question tests understanding of glacial lake features and terminology.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                   Focus Area
1. Stockholm Convention                     :   Regulation of POPs
2. Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) :   Ratified the Stockholm Convention in 2006
3. Global Environment Facility (GEF)       :   Interim financial mechanism for the Stockholm Convention
4.  Regulation of POP Rules, 2018           :   Implemented under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Stockholm Convention is an international agreement focused on regulating Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). India, through the MoEFCC, ratified this convention in 2006. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) serves as the interim financial mechanism for the convention.  The Regulation of POP Rules, 2018, were indeed notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  All other options are incorrect because they omit at least one correct pairing.  This question assesses knowledge of international environmental agreements and national-level implementation.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Soil Management Technique               Description/Application
1. Liming                                   :   Incorporation of lime, gypsum, or dolomite
2. Using industrial by-products              :   Growing acid-tolerant crops
3. Growing acid-tolerant crops             :   Managing acid soils
4. Sugarcane and bananas                    :   Examples of acid-tolerant crops

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Liming is correctly defined as the incorporation of lime, gypsum, or dolomite into the soil.  Growing acid-tolerant crops is a method for managing acid soils. Sugarcane and bananas are examples of such crops.  However, using industrial by-products is a technique for managing acid soils, but not the same as growing acid-tolerant crops. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of acid-tolerant crops. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of liming. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of industrial by-products.  This question tests knowledge of soil management techniques.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geothermal Energy Issue                  Description
1. Land subsidence                          :   Release of toxic chemicals
2. High transportation costs                 :   Remote plant location
3. Release of toxic chemicals               :   Mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony
4. Higher capital costs                      :   Techno-economic viability issue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

High transportation costs are indeed associated with the remote location of geothermal plants. The release of toxic chemicals like mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony is a known issue. Higher capital costs contribute to techno-economic viability concerns.  However, land subsidence is a consequence of geothermal energy extraction, but the provided text doesn't directly link it to the release of toxic chemicals.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct pairings or include an incorrect one. The question tests knowledge of the challenges associated with geothermal energy.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) Product    Use/Application
1. Syngas                                     :   Mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide
2. Electricity                                :   Product of UCG
3. Chemical feedstock                         :   Product of UCG
4. Hydrogen                                   :   In-situ combustion of coal seam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Syngas is accurately described as a mixture of methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.  Electricity and chemical feedstock are both products of UCG.  However, hydrogen is a component of syngas, not the in-situ combustion process itself.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of chemical feedstock. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of syngas. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect pairing of hydrogen.  The question assesses understanding of the products and applications of UCG.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Environmental Agreement         Key Feature/Goal
1. EU’s Nature Restoration Plan (NRP)         :   Aims for net-zero emissions by 2050
2. European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)  :   Binding restoration targets for land and sea areas
3. Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) :   Ensures key goods don't contribute to deforestation
4.  Aichi Biodiversity Targets               :   Supported by the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The EU’s Nature Restoration Plan (NRP) focuses on binding restoration targets, not net-zero emissions (that's a goal of the European Green Deal, of which the NRP is a part). The EUDR aims to prevent deforestation and forest degradation through regulation of goods, not restoration targets.  The KMGBF is a broad biodiversity framework, not specifically about deforestation. However, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets are indeed supported by the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI). Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair. This question tests knowledge of international environmental agreements and their specific goals.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  HQ Location
1. UNDRR                                       :   New York, USA
2. UNEP                                        :   Nairobi, Kenya
3. WMO                                         :   Geneva, Switzerland
4. SBTi                                        :   London, UK
5. CTCN                                        :   Copenhagen, Denmark


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.  The other options present incorrect headquarters locations.  The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) is based in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York.  The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is located in Nairobi, Kenya.  The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is not based in London. While SBTi has collaborative partners globally, it does not have a central HQ in London.  It operates as a collaborative initiative.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Primary Focus
1. SAMOA Pathway                               :   Addressing challenges faced by Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
2. Progressive Platforms Initiative             :   Empowering Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in climate negotiations
3. 2023 UN Resolution on climate justice       :   Securing legal opinion on state obligations concerning biodiversity
4. Climate Promise Initiative                    :   Supporting developing countries in NDC implementation
5. Greening Education Partnership              :   Promoting sustainable development goals in education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The Progressive Platforms Initiative focuses on building capacity for SIDS in climate negotiations.  The Climate Promise Initiative supports developing countries in enhancing and implementing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Greening Education Partnership aims to integrate climate action into education systems.  Option (a) is incorrect because the SAMOA Pathway targets Small Island Developing States (SIDS), not Least Developed Countries (LDCs), and the 2023 UN resolution focuses on climate change obligations, not biodiversity. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the Greening Education Partnership. Option (d) is incorrect as multiple pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative          Key Feature/Goal
1. Sendai Framework                             :   Developed under the Hyogo Framework for Action
2. Stockholm Convention                         :   Regulates Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
3. International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea :   Advisory opinion on states' climate change mitigation obligations
4. Paris Agreement                              :   Establishes Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
5.  UNEA-6 Resolution 10                       :   Focuses on global air quality improvement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Stockholm Convention is indeed a legally binding agreement on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). The Paris Agreement establishes the framework of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for climate action.  UNEA-6 Resolution 10 directly addresses regional cooperation to improve global air quality.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Sendai Framework succeeded the Hyogo Framework, not the other way around.  While the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) did provide an advisory opinion, it is not the central feature or goal of the tribunal itself. Option (c) includes the incorrect pairing of the Sendai Framework. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccurate pairing of the Sendai Framework.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant/Substance                       Characteristic/Impact
1.  Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)                     :   Global warming potential 273 times that of CO₂
2.  Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA):   Used in treatment of respiratory illnesses
3.  Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)                     :   Removed from flue gas by FGD systems
4.  Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)      :   High water solubility
5.  Particulate Matter (PM2.5)                :   Not regulated by WHO Air Quality Guidelines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because Nitrous oxide (N₂O) does have a global warming potential significantly higher than CO₂, and sulfur dioxide (SO₂) is indeed removed from flue gases using Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) systems.  The other options contain inaccuracies. DCPA is a herbicide, not a respiratory treatment. POPs are characterized by low water solubility, facilitating bioaccumulation.  PM2.5 is explicitly regulated by WHO Air Quality Guidelines.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                      Application/Goal
1.  Air Quality Management Exchange Platform (AQMx) :   Developed by the World Health Organization
2.  Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD)           :   Reduces SO₂ emissions from coal-fired power plants
3.  National Pest Surveillance System (NPSS) :   Promotes the use of synthetic pesticides in agriculture
4.  Parametric Insurance                      :   Covers actual losses incurred from a disaster event
5.  Basal-hydrology interventions            :   Accelerates glacial melt


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only option (c) is completely correct. Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) systems are specifically designed to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from coal-fired power plants. The other options contain inaccuracies. AQMx is a platform developed by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), not WHO. NPSS promotes Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which emphasizes biopesticides and reduces reliance on synthetic chemicals. Parametric insurance covers the probability of a disaster, not the actual losses. Basal-hydrology interventions aim to slow glacial melt, not accelerate it.


**1. With reference to Wetlands, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion                                      Example of Wetland Meeting Criterion
1. Regularly supports 20,000 or more water birds:  Keoladeo National Park (Rajasthan)
2. Conserving biological diversity                 :  Loktak Lake (Manipur)
3.  Significant value for humanity as a whole     :  Ashtamudi Wetland (Kerala)
4.  Changes in ecological character due to human interference :  Sundarbans Mangrove (West Bengal)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Keoladeo Ghana National Park, a Ramsar site, is renowned for its exceptional avian biodiversity, regularly supporting over 20,000 water birds. Loktak Lake, another Ramsar site, is a significant biodiversity hotspot, showcasing rich flora and fauna, including the endangered Sangai deer.  Ashtamudi Wetland, a Ramsar site in Kerala, is recognized for its ecological significance and the benefits it provides to local communities and broader humanity. The Sundarbans, while a Ramsar site and globally significant, has experienced ecological changes due to human activities, including pollution and habitat modification, thus fitting the Montreux Record criteria. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair involving Ashtamudi. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pair involving Keoladeo.  Option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all three pairs.



**2. With reference to the Ramsar Convention, consider the following pairs:**

Options (a), (b), and (c) omit correctly matched pairs.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Oceanographic Phenomenon                     Description
1. Red Tides                                  :   Caused by the accumulation of toxic algae blooms
2. Plankton Crashes                            :   Primarily due to a lack of CO2 in the early production cycle
3. Gape Limitation                              :   Refers to the physical constraint on prey size a predator can consume

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Red tides are indeed caused by the accumulation of certain types of algae, often dinoflagellates, that produce toxins.  These blooms can discolor the water, often appearing reddish-brown, hence the name. The toxins produced can harm marine life and even humans if they consume contaminated seafood.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Pair 2 is partially correct but incomplete. While a lack of CO2 can contribute to plankton crashes in the early stages of their life cycle (limiting photosynthesis), it's not the sole cause.  Plankton crashes are complex events influenced by multiple factors, including nutrient limitation, changes in water temperature and salinity, disease outbreaks, and predation.  The statement is oversimplified and therefore incorrect.

Pair 3 is correctly matched. Gape limitation is a well-established ecological concept referring to the physical restriction on the size of prey an organism can consume based on the size of its mouth. This significantly influences food web structure and predator-prey dynamics.  Larger predators are able to consume larger prey, shaping the community structure.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ecological Concept                           Characteristic
1. Megafauna                                   :  Animals weighing above 50 kg, classified by diet type
2. Stromatolites                               :  Microbial communities associated with layered rock formations, crucial for the Great Oxygenation Event
3. Environmental DNA (eDNA)                  :  Organismal DNA released into the environment, used for species detection

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Megafauna accurately describes animals exceeding a certain weight threshold (generally above 50 kg), often categorized by their dietary habits as herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.  The description accurately reflects the definition.

Stromatolites are indeed layered structures formed by microbial communities, primarily cyanobacteria. Their historical significance in the Great Oxidation Event, where they significantly contributed to the rise of atmospheric oxygen, is well-established in geological science.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a rapidly advancing technique in ecology and conservation biology.  It involves the detection of DNA fragments released by organisms into the environment (water, soil, etc.), providing a powerful tool for species monitoring and biodiversity assessment.  The description accurately matches this application.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative             Focus
1. UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) :   Establishes the International Seabed Authority (ISA)
2. International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI)      :   Founded in 1994 to address coral bleaching
3. Ramsar Convention                              :   Framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands globally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is a comprehensive international agreement governing various aspects of ocean use and management.  A key component is the establishment of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) responsible for regulating activities in the international seabed area.

The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) is a global partnership dedicated to the conservation and sustainable management of coral reefs. While not solely focused on coral bleaching, it addresses the issue as a significant threat to reef health.  The founding year is also accurate.

The Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty established for the conservation and wise use of wetlands.  It provides a framework for national and international action, including the designation of Ramsar sites.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue                         Related Concept
1. Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD)                 :   Decrease in oxygen content of ocean waters, linked to global warming and eutrophication
2. Grasshopper Effect                          :   Accumulation of pollutants in the Arctic region via atmospheric and oceanic currents
3. Soil Acidification                           :   Loss of soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and increased aluminum toxicity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the environmental issue and the associated concept. Aquatic deoxygenation (AD) is the decline in oxygen levels in water bodies, driven by factors like global warming (reduced oxygen solubility) and eutrophication (increased oxygen consumption by decomposing algae).

The "grasshopper effect" describes the long-range transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and other chemicals to high-latitude regions like the Arctic.  These pollutants are carried by atmospheric and oceanic currents, accumulating in these seemingly remote areas.

Soil acidification involves a decrease in soil pH, leading to various detrimental effects.  These include the loss of soil inorganic carbon (SIC), increased aluminum toxicity, and reduced nutrient availability.  The listed impacts are key characteristics of acidified soils.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Conservation Initiative/Project              Focus
1. Crocodile Conservation Project               :   Initiated in Odisha's Bhitarkanika National Park
2. MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative)                :   Under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MOEF&CC)
3. Coral Reef Recovery Project-Mithapur        :   Used biorock technology for coral reef restoration

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Crocodile Conservation Project, a significant initiative for the conservation of crocodiles in India, was indeed launched in Bhitarkanika National Park in Odisha.  This park is a crucial habitat for saltwater crocodiles.

MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes) is a government-led program aimed at promoting mangrove conservation and related livelihood opportunities.  Its placement under the MOEF&CC is accurate.

The Coral Reef Recovery Project-Mithapur successfully employed biorock technology, a technique that uses low-voltage electricity to accelerate coral growth and reef restoration. This project demonstrated a successful application of innovative technology in marine conservation.

4. Biomass                             :   Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  While the text mentions projects utilizing green hydrogen in Indore (GAIL), Surat (NTPC), and Greater Noida (NTPC), it doesn't explicitly link these projects to specific renewable energy sources like wind, solar, or hydropower used for electrolysis.  The hydrogen source is described as "renewable," but the precise source for each location is not detailed.  The mention of Tuticorin relates to a Green Hydrogen Hub, not a specific project using a particular renewable energy source for hydrogen production. The use of biomass for green hydrogen production is mentioned generally, not in the context of a specific location.  Therefore, all the pairings are incorrect, leading to option (d) as the correct answer. The question tests the candidate's ability to critically analyze information and avoid making assumptions based on incomplete data.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                     Green Hydrogen Initiative/Project
1. GAIL Limited                     :   SIGHT Programme
2. NTPC Limited                     :   GOBARdhan Initiative
3. Oil India Limited                 :   Development of a 60-kW hydrogen fuel cell bus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Oil India Limited is explicitly mentioned as having developed a 60-kW capacity hydrogen fuel cell bus.  GAIL Limited's involvement is with blending hydrogen into a city gas distribution grid, not directly with the SIGHT Programme, although both relate to green hydrogen initiatives.  NTPC Limited is associated with green hydrogen blending projects, but not with the GOBARdhan initiative, which focuses on biogas production from waste.  The GOBARdhan initiative is unrelated to green hydrogen production. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various organizations and their specific roles within the broader context of green hydrogen development in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Green Hydrogen Application         Specific Example Mentioned in the Text
1. Aviation                             :   Hydrogen-based Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) Buses
2. Fertilizer Production                 :   Blending of Green Hydrogen in City Gas Distribution grid in Indore
3. Steel Industry                       :   Oil India Limited's 60-kW hydrogen fuel cell bus
4. Power Generation                    :   Green Ammonia Production under SIGHT Programme

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The text explicitly mentions the allocation for bidding for Green Ammonia production under the SIGHT Programme, directly relating to green hydrogen's application in power generation (through ammonia production).  The other pairings are incorrect.  Hydrogen-based FCEV buses are mentioned as an application, but not specifically linked to aviation.  Blending hydrogen into a city gas distribution grid is related to transportation, not fertilizer production.  Oil India's fuel cell bus is related to transportation, not steel production. The question tests the student's ability to accurately associate specific applications of green hydrogen with the examples provided in the text, demanding precise recall of information.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geothermal Energy Feature       Fact
1.  Renewable heat energy           :   Identified potential of 10,600 MW in India
2.  Stored in the Earth             :   Part of the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana
3.  Generated in the Earth's crust  :   First virtual Joint working group meeting held between India and USA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Geothermal energy is explicitly described as renewable heat energy generated and stored in the earth. The identified potential of 10,600 MW in India directly supports this. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana is unrelated to geothermal energy. The virtual joint working group meeting is associated with RETAP (a clean energy partnership), not geothermal energy.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of geothermal energy's characteristics and its factual association with the provided information, while also including plausible but incorrect distractors.

3. Located inside a Tiger Reserve    :   Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The text explicitly states that the Tawa Reservoir (mentioned as a Ramsar site) is located inside the Satpura Tiger Reserve.  The other pairs are incorrect.  Nagi and Nakti sanctuaries are described as man-made reservoirs, not Kazhuveli.  Kazhuveli is a brackish shallow lake, not Nagi and Nakti. Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary is not mentioned as being within a tiger reserve. The question assesses the candidate’s ability to accurately identify the type of wetland based on the descriptions provided in the text, requiring careful reading and precise recall.

EnviStats India 2024 provides data on various aspects of the environment, including ecosystem accounting, making pair 5 correct. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits pair 5, while option (c) is incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because pair 3 is mismatched.


**1. With reference to environmental legislation and organizations in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Organization                                  Legal Basis/Mandate
    1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)     :   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 only
    2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)              :   Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
    3. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)        :   Implementation of legislations relating to prevention and control of environmental pollution
    4. Committee for Air Quality Management     :  Specific legislation mentioned in the provided text

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct as it's mandated under both acts, not just the Air Act. The NGT's establishment and powers aren't directly linked to the 1974 or 1981 Acts; it has a separate legal basis. The CGWB's mandate doesn't explicitly involve implementing all environmental pollution legislations; its focus is groundwater management. The Committee for Air Quality Management's legal basis isn't specified in the provided text.  Hence, only the first pair has a partially correct match. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the matching of the organizations with their legal bases or mandates.  The question highlights the importance of precise understanding of the legal frameworks governing different environmental bodies in India, a critical aspect for UPSC preparation.  Understanding the specific acts that govern each organization is vital for analyzing their roles and limitations in environmental protection.


**2. With reference to sustainable development initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                         Key Feature
    1. SDG India Index 2023-24                       : Measures progress on 113 indicators aligned to the National Indicator Framework.
    2. Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)      :  First launched by Uttarakhand
    3. National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF) : Aims to cover 12 lakh hectares in 600 major blocks
    4. Parivesh Portal                               :  Developed by the Ministry of Jal Shakti

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index accurately tracks progress across various indicators as per the given text.  Uttarakhand pioneered the GEPI initiative. The NMNF aims to achieve the stated targets. However, the Parivesh portal is developed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, not the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair related to the Parivesh Portal. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various sustainable development initiatives, their key features, and the organizations associated with them. The inclusion of plausible distractors like the incorrect ministry for Parivesh adds to the question's difficulty, requiring precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to environmental monitoring and reporting in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                      Key Characteristic
    1. Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas : Released by the Ministry of Jal Shakti
    2. Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024   : Ranks 180 countries
    3. Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024          : India ranked 176
    4.  EnviStats                                      : First released in 2018

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The EPI 2024 and NCI 2024 reports accurately reflect their key characteristics as described in the provided context.  EnviStats were indeed first released in 2018. The LULC Atlas is released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair concerning the LULC Atlas. This question assesses the candidate's awareness of various environmental reports, indices, and their key attributes, testing recall and understanding of environmental data reporting mechanisms in India.  The inclusion of an incorrect ministry for the LULC Atlas acts as a crucial distractor.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

     Project/Initiative                                   Implementing/Associated Agency
    1. Project Tiger                                    :  Ministry of Jal Shakti
    2. Bustard Recovery Project                         : Wildlife Institute of India
    3. Crocodile Conservation Project                   : Bombay Natural History Society
    4. People's Biodiversity Register (PBR)           :  National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The Bustard Recovery Project is indeed implemented by the Wildlife Institute of India.  The Bombay Natural History Society is significantly involved in the Crocodile Conservation Project.  However, Project Tiger falls under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, not the Ministry of Jal Shakti. The PBR is primarily associated with Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs), not CAMPA. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 have a correct match. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.  This question evaluates the candidate's knowledge about specific conservation projects in India and the agencies involved in their implementation, testing factual recall and association.  The inclusion of incorrect agencies for Project Tiger and PBR serves as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge of project implementation structures.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Governing Act/Establishment
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)       :   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)                :   Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
3. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)          :   Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
4. Committee for Air Quality Management       :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, pair 1 is partially correct, as it's established under the Water Act but also operates under the Air Act.  The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a specialized environmental court, not directly governed by either the Water or Air Acts.  The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) isn't established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, although it operates within the environmental sector. The Committee for Air Quality Management functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, making pair 4 correct. Option (c) is the only one that correctly identifies pairs 1 and 4 as correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include pairs that are not accurately matched based on the provided information.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative             Key Focus Area
1. Antarctic Treaty                               :   Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
2. Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals:   Peaceful use of Antarctica
3. Protocol on Environmental Protection to Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol) : Reduction of mercury use in artisanal gold mining


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Antarctic Treaty's key provisions include ensuring Antarctica is used for peaceful purposes only, facilitating international scientific cooperation, and prohibiting nuclear explosions and military deployments.  While the treaty indirectly supports the conservation of Antarctic resources, its primary focus isn't solely on that. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals directly addresses seal conservation. The Madrid Protocol focuses on environmental protection in Antarctica, not mercury reduction in gold mining (that's related to PlanetGOLD, a separate initiative).  Therefore, only pair 1 has a connection, although not a direct, primary focus. The other options incorrectly include pairs with mismatched focus areas.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                    Primary Goal
1. Green Credit Programme (GCP)                       :   Promote renewable energy and facilitate compliance of renewable purchase obligations (RPO)
2. Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme           :   Reduce specific energy consumption in large energy-intensive industries
3. Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023       :   Encourage industries to meet their existing environmental obligations voluntarily


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Green Credit Programme (GCP) aims to incentivize environmentally friendly practices, aligning with the 'LiFE' initiative, not directly focused on renewable energy obligations.  The Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme mandates energy-intensive industries to reduce their specific energy consumption, making pair 2 correct. The Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS) establishes a market-based mechanism for GHG emission reduction, not solely for voluntary compliance. Therefore, only pair 2 accurately reflects the primary goal of the scheme. The other options incorrectly attribute goals to the schemes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                            Key Characteristic/Function
1.  National Information System for Climate and Environment Studies (NICES) Programme:   Supports community-led conservation initiatives
2.  Climate Policy Initiative (CPI)                   :   Develops standards for corporate climate targets
3.  Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)           :   Provides independent analysis of climate finance flows


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NICES programme focuses on climate and environmental research using data from ISRO, not community-led initiatives.  The Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) provides independent analysis and research on climate finance, energy, and land use policies. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) develops standards and guidance for companies to set science-based emission reduction targets. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The other options misrepresent the functions of the organizations.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Index/Account                      Key Feature/Measurement
1. Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)          :   Measures national progress on SDGs
2. SDG India Index 2023-24                          :   Evaluates ecological development based on air, soil, water, and forest quality
3.  Natural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem services (NCAVES) :   Develops environment statistics and methodology for national resource accounts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI) evaluates ecological development based on four pillars: air, soil, tree, and water, not SDG progress. The SDG India Index tracks national progress on Sustainable Development Goals.  Natural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem services (NCAVES) focuses on developing methodologies for environmental economic accounting. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly link indices and their features.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Program                  Implementing Agency/Organization
1. Mangrove Breakthrough                           :   United Nations High Level Climate Champions and the Global Mangrove Alliance
2. MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes) :   World Wildlife Fund (WWF) India
3. Magical Mangroves Campaign                      :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mangrove Breakthrough initiative was launched by the United Nations High Level Climate Champions and the Global Mangrove Alliance.  MISHTI is implemented under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEF&CC). The Magical Mangroves campaign is a citizen engagement initiative by WWF India. Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Legislation/Act                   Key Provision/Focus
1. Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980                :   Regulates the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes
2. Environment (Protection) Act, 1986            :   Establishes the National Green Tribunal (NGT)
3. Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974:   Sets minimum requirements for creating a green school


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, primarily deals with the regulation and approval of forest land diversion. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broad framework for environmental protection, including enabling the establishment of bodies like the NGT. The Water Act focuses on water pollution control, not green schools.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Pair 3 is incorrect.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   International body/Conference                     Outcome/Focus
1. UNFCCC COP29                                   :   Finalized rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
2. Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW):   Launched the first project call for the Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund
3. Fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5):   Released ‘The Economics of Water: Valuing the Hydrological Cycle’ report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

UNFCCC COP29 finalized rules related to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on carbon markets. The GCEW released a report on water economics, not related to the GFC Fund. ICCM5 established the GFC Fund. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link the bodies and their outcomes.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disaster Management Initiative        Implementing Agency/Body
1. FloodWatch India mobile application :   Ministry of Jal Shakti
2. Early Warnings for All (EW4All)     :   World Meteorological Organization
3. National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)  :   Central Water Commission
4. State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) :    Ministry of Home Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

FloodWatch India is a mobile application developed by the Central Water Commission (CWC) under the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative is spearheaded by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched.  The State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) is the nodal agency for the implementation of the NDRF and SDRF at the state level, but the funds themselves are managed under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched, while pair 3 is incorrect.  The NDRF is managed by the MHA, not the CWC.  The CWC plays a crucial role in providing hydrological data for disaster preparedness, but it's not the primary implementing agency for the NDRF. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various disaster management initiatives in India and their corresponding implementing agencies. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different government ministries and organizations in disaster management is critical.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like the CWC being linked to NDRF makes this question challenging, requiring precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Legislation/Regulation      Governing Body/Ministry
1. Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 :  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)
2. Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981  :  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
3. E-waste (Management) Rules, 2022      :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
4. Hazardous waste (Management and Handling) Amendment Rules, 2003 : National Green Tribunal (NGT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is the statutory body formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The E-waste (Management) Rules, 2022, fall under the purview of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, making pair 3 correct. However, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is not the governing body for the Water Act; the CPCB is.  The National Green Tribunal (NGT) does not govern the 2003 Hazardous Waste Amendment Rules; rather, it receives cases related to environmental violations, including those concerning hazardous waste. This highlights the distinction between a regulatory body that sets rules and a judicial body that enforces them. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of environmental regulations in India and the roles of different organizations in their implementation and enforcement. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings like 1 and 4 increases the difficulty level, requiring specific knowledge rather than general awareness.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Environmental Agreement/Initiative       Key Focus/Objective
1. Sendai Framework                               :   Climate Change Mitigation
2. SAMOA Pathway                                   :   Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
3. Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund     :   Sustainable Water Resource Management
4.  International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) :   Disaster Risk Reduction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The SAMOA Pathway aims to address the unique challenges faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and support their development. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), which the UNDRR facilitates, focuses on disaster risk reduction. Hence, pair 4 is correct. The Sendai Framework is a disaster risk reduction framework, not specifically focused on climate change mitigation, although climate change is a significant factor in disaster risk. The Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund addresses the sustainable management of chemicals and waste, not water resource management. This question tests the candidate's understanding of various international environmental agreements and their specific objectives.  The inclusion of seemingly plausible distractors, such as linking the Sendai Framework to climate change mitigation, makes the question challenging and requires precise knowledge of the frameworks' mandates.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Climate Change Related Term/Concept           Description/Feature
1. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)     :   Global Methane Pledge
2.  Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs)        :   Reports submitted under Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)
3.  Just Transition                               :   Equitable economic greening
4.  New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG)        :  Target for annual climate finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) are regular reports submitted by countries under the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) of the Paris Agreement.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) sets a target for annual climate finance, primarily focusing on the financial support developed countries provide to developing nations for climate action. Thus, pair 4 is correct.  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are individual countries' pledges for climate action, not specifically related to the Global Methane Pledge, although methane reduction could be a component of an NDC. A "Just Transition" refers to a fair and inclusive approach to greening the economy, creating decent work opportunities, and leaving no one behind.  This question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of key terms and concepts related to climate change negotiations and agreements.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings, such as linking NDCs to the Global Methane Pledge, makes the question demanding and requires thorough understanding of climate change terminology and agreements.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Index/Indicator              Key Feature/Measurement
1.  Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)    :   Measures ecological development from human interventions
2.  SDG India Index 2023-24                  :   Tracks progress on 113 indicators aligned to National Indicator Framework
3.  EnviStats                                 :   Released by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change
4.  Natural Capital Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem services (NCAVES) :   Launched by the World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI) is a novel method to evaluate ecological development caused by human interventions. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The SDG India Index 2023-24 measures and tracks national progress on 113 indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework.  Hence, pair 2 is correct.  However, EnviStats are released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change. NCAVES was launched by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), UNEP, and the Secretariat of CBD, not the World Bank.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various environmental indices and their methodologies.  The use of plausible but incorrect distractors, such as associating EnviStats with the Ministry of Environment, increases the difficulty level, demanding accurate knowledge of the source and nature of each index.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                         Affected Region(s)
1. El Niño                             :   Indonesia and Australia (droughts)
2. La Niña                             :   Indian Subcontinent (strong monsoon)
3. Nor'westers                        :   West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand
4. Kallakkadal                        :   Kerala and Tamil Nadu coastlines
5. GLOFs                               :   Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

El Niño is indeed associated with droughts in Indonesia and Australia, while La Niña typically brings stronger monsoons to the Indian subcontinent.  Nor'westers, localized thunderstorms, are a prominent feature of the summer season in West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand. Kallakkadal refers to coastal flooding in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, driven by swell waves.  Finally, GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods) are a significant risk in the Himalayan states listed, including Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.  All pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding these geographical phenomena and their regional impacts is crucial for disaster preparedness and environmental management in India and Southeast Asia.  The question tests the examinee's knowledge of distinct environmental events and their specific geographical associations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  Indian Cyclones                    :   IMD's colour-coded weather warnings
3.  Hyperlocal Flood Forecasting in Kerala :   CoS-it-FloWS system
4.  Drought Monitoring in India        :   Drought Early Warning System (DEWS)
5.  Arctic Heat Radiation Measurement  :   PREFIRE mission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is indeed used to categorize the intensity of tropical cyclones, including those in Southeast Asia.  The IMD (India Meteorological Department) employs a color-coded warning system for cyclones affecting India. CoS-it-FloWS is specifically designed for hyperlocal flood forecasting in Kerala.  The Drought Early Warning System (DEWS) is used to monitor and predict droughts across India. Finally, the PREFIRE mission is focused on measuring heat radiation from the Arctic and Antarctic. All five pairs accurately link the weather event or monitoring system to its correct scale or application.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question highlights the diverse range of systems used for weather monitoring and disaster management, demonstrating a grasp of both national and international initiatives.

2. Oil Spills                           :   Bioremediation
3. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs):   Moraine dam instability
4. Air Pollution                       :   AQMX platform
5.  Arctic Pollution                    :   Global distillation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Global warming is a major driver of aquatic deoxygenation. Oil spills are addressed, in part, through bioremediation techniques. Moraine dam instability is a significant factor contributing to GLOFs. The AQMX platform is directly related to air quality management.  Finally, global distillation (or the grasshopper effect) is a process that transports pollutants, including those affecting the Arctic.  Each pair shows a correct linkage between the environmental issue and a relevant associated phenomenon or technology. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accurate pairings across all five items.

5.  Chagos Archipelago                      :   Located in the Atlantic Ocean


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Little Prespa Lake is mostly in Greece, it does extend into Albania. The Amazon is the largest by volume, not length (the Nile is longer). The Alps' highest peak is indeed Mont Blanc. The Sahara is bounded by the Sahel to the *south*, not the north. The Chagos Archipelago is in the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic. Therefore, only the statement about the Alps' highest peak is entirely correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are all incorrect because they misrepresent the accurate number of correctly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific geographical features and their characteristics, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, making simple guessing difficult.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Central Water Commission (CWC) report indicates a significant increase in the surface area of glacial lakes across several Himalayan states and union territories between 2011 and 2024.  The report specifically highlights that 67 lakes identified as high-risk for GLOFs experienced an increase of over 40% in their surface area.  Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh are explicitly mentioned as regions exhibiting this notable expansion. Therefore, all the pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to interpret data presented concisely.  Understanding the CWC's role in monitoring glacial lake expansion is also crucial for a comprehensive answer.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly defines the different categories of glacial lakes.  A moraine-dammed lake is defined as a body of water held back by a moraine (material left behind by a glacier). An ice-dammed lake is formed when ice acts as the dam. Finally, erosion-formed lakes are those where water accumulates in depressions created by erosion.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly swap the defining characteristics of moraine-dammed and ice-dammed lakes. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific terminology related to glacial lakes.  The incorrect options act as plausible distractors, testing the candidate’s ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text provides specific examples of GLOF events and their locations.  The 2013 GLOF occurred at the Chorabari glacial lake in Uttarakhand, leading to devastating floods in the Mandakini River. The 2023 GLOF at South Lhonak in Sikkim caused the destruction of the Teesta III Dam at Chungthang. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 incorrectly associates the 2013 GLOF with South Lhonak, which is linked to the 2023 event. The question tests factual recall of specific events and their geographical locations. The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of GLOF incidents in the Himalayas.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of GLOFs                 Example/Description
1. Geological factors              : Excessive precipitation
2. Morphological factors          : Mass movement into glacial lakes
3. Physical factors                : Earthquake, breach of moraine dams


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text lists various causes of GLOFs, categorizing them into geological, morphological, and physical factors.  Geological factors include events like earthquakes and the breach of moraine dams. Morphological factors involve processes such as mass movement into glacial lakes and water seepage through glacial structures. Physical factors encompass excessive precipitation and cryoseisms. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 3 incorrectly assign causes to the wrong categories. This question tests the understanding of the different causal mechanisms behind GLOFs, requiring careful analysis of the provided information.  The incorrect options are carefully chosen to test the candidate's ability to discriminate between closely related concepts.  


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Climate Change                 : No
2. Novel Entities                  : Yes
3. Ocean Acidification            : Yes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text discusses planetary boundaries and their status.  It explicitly states that six out of nine planetary boundaries have been transgressed.  Climate change is one of the boundaries that *has* been transgressed.  Novel entities (new substances introduced into the environment) are also mentioned as having been transgressed. Ocean acidification is mentioned as *not* having been transgressed. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because climate change is indeed a transgressed boundary. This question assesses both factual recall and the ability to interpret information regarding the planetary boundaries framework, a topic of increasing relevance in environmental studies.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precision in interpreting the provided data.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 GLOF at South Lhonak, Sikkim, resulted in the destruction of the Teesta III Dam at Chungthang.  This accurately pairs the GLOF event with its location. The 2013 GLOF in the Chorabari glacial lake triggered floods in the Mandakini river in Uttarakhand, correctly matching the event and location. However, the Teesta III Dam is situated in Sikkim, not Arunachal Pradesh. The inclusion of this incorrect pairing serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of geographical locations associated with GLOF events.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair involving the Teesta III Dam's location.  A thorough understanding of GLOF events in the Indian Himalayas is crucial for successfully answering this question.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement correctly identifies a defining characteristic of the Animalia kingdom. Animals are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their nutrition by consuming other organisms.  Plants (Plantae) are characterized by cell walls made of cellulose, not chitin, which is found in fungi. While many fungi are multicellular, this isn't universally true; some are unicellular (yeasts).  Therefore, only pair 2 accurately matches the kingdom with a key characteristic. Option (a) is incorrect because plants do not have chitinous cell walls. Option (c) is incorrect because multicellularity is not a defining characteristic of all fungi. Option (d) is incorrect as only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Understanding the fundamental differences between these three kingdoms is crucial for comprehending biodiversity and ecological interactions.  The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of basic biology and their ability to differentiate between key features of different kingdoms of life.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Focus Area
1. IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) :   Mycoremediation
2. Global Fungal Red List Initiative            :   Fungal conservation
3. UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme :   Biosphere reserve establishment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Fungal Red List Initiative directly addresses the conservation status of fungal species, aligning perfectly with its name. UNESCO's Man and Biosphere Programme is dedicated to establishing and managing biosphere reserves worldwide, a crucial aspect of conservation.  However, FunCC's primary focus is not mycoremediation, although it might indirectly contribute to it. Mycoremediation is the use of fungi to remove pollutants from the environment. While FunCC's work on fungal conservation could indirectly benefit mycoremediation efforts, its core mission revolves around the conservation and study of fungi.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because FunCC's primary focus is not mycoremediation. Option (c) is incorrect because FunCC's primary focus is not mycoremediation. Option (d) is incorrect because FunCC's primary focus is not mycoremediation. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of international organizations involved in environmental conservation and their specific areas of expertise.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue                            Impact
1. Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD)                  :   Coral bleaching
2. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)        :   Endocrine disruption
3. Microplastic Pollution                       :   Low birth weight in fetuses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are well-known endocrine disruptors, interfering with the hormone systems of living organisms, leading to various health problems.  Aquatic deoxygenation (AD) primarily impacts marine life through oxygen depletion, leading to "dead zones," and affecting marine food webs. While it can indirectly contribute to coral bleaching (through warming waters), it's not the direct cause. Microplastics, being ingested by marine organisms, affect the food chain and can cause various health problems, but low birth weight in fetuses is primarily linked to exposure to other pollutants like DCPA.  Therefore, only pair 2 correctly links the environmental issue with its direct impact. Option (a) is incorrect because AD does not directly cause coral bleaching. Option (c) is incorrect because microplastics do not directly cause low birth weight in fetuses. Option (d) is incorrect because only the second pair is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's ability to connect specific environmental problems with their documented consequences, highlighting the interconnectedness of ecological and human health.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Location                                      Significance
1. Bhitarkanika National Park                   :   Largest mangrove ecosystem in India
2. Western Ghats                              :   Proposed 37% as Eco-sensitive Area (ESA) by Kasturirangan Committee
3. Lakshadweep Islands                         :   Affected by Marine Heatwaves (MHWs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Western Ghats' designation of 37% as an ESA by the Kasturirangan Committee is accurate.  The Lakshadweep Islands' recent experience with Marine Heatwaves is also a documented event.  However, Bhitarkanika National Park is the *second* largest mangrove ecosystem in India, after the Sundarbans.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because Bhitarkanika is not the largest mangrove ecosystem in India. Option (b) is incorrect because both pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because Bhitarkanika is not the largest mangrove ecosystem in India. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific geographic locations, their environmental significance, and recent events related to environmental conservation and climate change.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative             Key Feature
1. Stockholm Convention                          :   Regulates Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
2. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction :   Aims for substantial reduction in disaster risk by 2030
3.  Global Environment Facility (GEF)           :   Interim financial mechanism for the Stockholm Convention

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Stockholm Convention's primary focus is the regulation of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction indeed sets a target of substantial risk reduction by 2030. The GEF serves as the interim financial mechanism for the Stockholm Convention.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of the agreements and initiatives mentioned.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because all three pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international environmental agreements and their objectives, demonstrating understanding of global cooperation in addressing environmental challenges.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant                                      Characteristic/Effect
1. Bisphenol A (BPA)                             :   Used primarily in the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics
2. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)  :   Linked to cardiovascular disease and cancer
3. Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA)    :   Banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
4. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)          :   Resist photolytic, biological, and chemical degradation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Bisphenol A (BPA) is indeed used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which are commonly found in food and beverage containers and coatings for metal products.  PFAS, often called "forever chemicals," due to their persistence in the environment, have been linked to various health issues, including cardiovascular disease and cancer.  The U.S. EPA has banned DCPA, a weed-killing pesticide, due to its harmful effects. Finally, POPs, a class of persistent organic pollutants, are characterized by their resistance to various degradation processes.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and exclude correctly matched pairs, making them incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue                         International Agreement/Initiative
1. Plastic Pollution                             :   Stockholm Convention
2. Mercury Pollution                            :   Minamata Convention on Mercury
3. Soil Acidification                          :   United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) negotiations
4. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)       :   Global Environment Facility (GEF) funding

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Minamata Convention on Mercury specifically addresses mercury pollution, while UNEP is actively involved in negotiations to tackle plastic pollution. The Stockholm Convention focuses on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Soil acidification, while not directly addressed by a single, specific international treaty, is a subject of ongoing discussions and initiatives under the umbrella of UNEP. The GEF provides funding for various environmental projects, including those related to POPs.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The Stockholm Convention is not primarily focused on plastic pollution; therefore, pair 1 is mismatched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Substance                           Associated Environmental Problem
1. Methylmercury                               :   Minamata disease
2.  Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)                        :   Global warming potential 273 times that of CO₂
3. Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)                       :   Removed by Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) systems
4. Methane                                     :   Controlled by biocovers in old dumpsites


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that causes Minamata disease. Nitrous oxide has a high global warming potential, significantly exceeding that of carbon dioxide.  Sulphur dioxide, a major air pollutant from coal-fired power plants, is effectively removed by FGD systems. Finally, biocovers utilize methanotrophic bacteria to convert methane into carbon dioxide, thus controlling methane emissions from landfills.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer because all the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Term/Concept                Description/Characteristic
1. Microplastics                               :   Particles less than five millimeters long
2. Plastic Overshoot Day                       :   Determined based on a country’s Mismanaged Waste Index (MWI)
3. Grasshopper Effect                          :   Accumulation of pollutants in the Arctic
4. Soil Acidification                          :   Decreases soil pH over time


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the definitions and characteristics of the given environmental terms. Microplastics are indeed small plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in length. Plastic Overshoot Day is calculated based on a country's Mismanaged Waste Index, reflecting the point when plastic waste exceeds management capacity. The Grasshopper Effect describes the long-range atmospheric transport and deposition of pollutants, particularly in the Arctic. Soil acidification is correctly defined as a process that lowers the pH of soil over time.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that accurately reflects all the given pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Focus/Activity
1.  UNEP                                          :   Launched a $134-million initiative to phase out mercury measuring devices
2.  WHO                                           :   Executes the UNEP's mercury phase-out project
3.  GEF                                           :   Funded the UNEP's mercury phase-out project
4.  CCAC                                          :   Launched the Air Quality Management Exchange Platform (AQMx)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The UNEP launched a significant initiative to phase out mercury-based medical devices. The WHO plays a crucial role in executing this project, working alongside UNEP. The GEF provides the funding for this initiative.  Finally, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) launched the AQMx platform.  Therefore, option (d) is correct as all four pairs are accurate.  Any option excluding one or more of these correctly matched pairs would be incorrect.


**1. With reference to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant                     Property/Effect
1. DDT                          :   Detected at high levels in human milk samples after 2004
2. PFAS                          :   Resist photolytic, biological and chemical degradation
3. Dieldrin                      :   Used primarily in production of polycarbonate plastics
4. Heptachlor                    :   Linked to liver damage and decreased fertility


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

DDT, a synthetic insecticide, saw a significant decrease in human milk samples since 2004, but replacement POPs like PFAS were detected at high levels, indicating a shift in pollutant presence.  PFAS,  belonging to the POP family, indeed resist degradation processes due to their chemical structure. Dieldrin and Heptachlor are classic examples of POPs known for their persistence and adverse health effects, including those mentioned in the pair.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes DDT. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits Heptachlor's correctly matched pair. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs Dieldrin with plastic production; Dieldrin is a persistent pesticide.


**2. With reference to Environmental Pollutants and their Impacts, consider the following pairs:**

   Pollutant                      Impact/Characteristic
1. Bisphenol A (BPA)             :   Impairs kidney function through gut microbiota disruption
2. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) :   Used in food can linings and bottle tops
3. Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA or Dacthal):  Persists in the environment and human bodies
4.  Black Carbon                  :   Formed by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

BPA is a chemical primarily used in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins found in food and beverage containers and can linings, not associated with kidney impairment through gut microbiota. PFAS are indeed used in various products, including non-stick cookware and some cosmetics, but their primary characteristic is their persistence in the environment and human bodies.  DCPA, a weed-killing pesticide, is correctly paired with its use on specific crops. Black carbon is correctly linked to its formation through incomplete combustion. Option (a), (b), and (c) are thus incomplete in their matching.


**3. With reference to Soil Acidification and its Management, consider the following pairs:**

   Process/Technique              Description/Effect
1. Soil Acidification            :   Increased aluminum toxicity in soil
2. Liming                        :    Incorporation of lime, gypsum, or dolomite
3. Growing acid-tolerant crops  :   Reduces soil inorganic carbon (SIC)
4. Use of industrial by-products :   Press mud from sugarcane industry


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Soil acidification correctly leads to increased aluminum toxicity and reduced nutrient availability. Liming is a valid technique for managing acid soils. The use of industrial by-products like press mud is also a recognized method. However, growing acid-tolerant crops doesn't directly reduce soil inorganic carbon (SIC); it's a mitigation strategy for the *effects* of acidification. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of industrial by-products. Option (b) is incomplete, leaving out the correct pairing of soil acidification. Option (d) incorrectly includes the pairing of acid-tolerant crops and SIC reduction.


**4. With reference to  Sustainable Practices and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Practice/Initiative            Description/Characteristic
1. Biocover                      :   Control fugitive methane emissions from old dumpsites
2. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) :   Emphasizes bio-pesticides and plant-origin pesticides
3. Food Waste Index (FWI)        :   Tracks global food waste at retail and consumer levels
4.  Just Energy Transition         :    Aims to halve per capita food waste


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biocover is correctly associated with its methane control function. IPM accurately reflects its eco-friendly approach. The FWI correctly focuses on tracking food waste. However, the Just Energy Transition aims for a fair and inclusive greening of the economy, not specifically food waste reduction.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incomplete or incorrect in their matching of the pairs.


**5. With reference to Environmental Monitoring and Reporting, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Index          Function/Characteristic
1. National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) :  Released Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India
2.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) :   Monitors global progress on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
3.  Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI) : Evaluates ecological development due to human interventions
4.  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) :  Receives environmental compensation under Polluter Pays Principle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NRSC's role in releasing the LULC Atlas is accurate. GEPI's function in evaluating ecological development is also correct.  However, the CPCB's role is primarily domestic environmental monitoring and enforcement, not global SDG monitoring. UN DESA is involved in SDG reporting, but not directly receiving environmental compensation. Option (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Fungal Characteristic                     Description
1.  Cell wall composition                 :   Primarily cellulose
2.  Mode of nutrition                     :   Exclusively autotrophic
3.  Body organization                     :   Always unicellular
4.  Ecological role                       :   Primary producers in most ecosystems
5.  Economic significance                 :   Limited to food production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Fungal cell walls are composed primarily of chitin, not cellulose (option 1 is incorrect). Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, deriving their nutrition from other organisms through saprophytic (decomposition) or parasitic means; they are not autotrophic (option 2 is incorrect). While some fungi are unicellular (like yeasts), many are multicellular with complex structures (option 3 is incorrect). Fungi play a crucial role as decomposers in nutrient cycling, not as primary producers (option 4 is incorrect).  Fungi have diverse economic significance beyond food, including applications in medicine (antibiotics, etc.) and bioremediation (option 5 is incorrect).  Understanding the fundamental characteristics of fungi is crucial for appreciating their ecological and economic roles.  The incorrect options highlight common misconceptions about fungal biology.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Coral Reef Feature                       Characteristic
1.  Primary Constituent                    :   Algae
2.  Symbiotic Relationship                 :   Between corals and zooplankton
3.  Growth Requirement                     :   Cold, deep waters
4.  Ecological Significance               :   Low biodiversity hotspot
5.  Conservation Challenge                :   Ocean acidification


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only option 5 is correctly matched. Coral reefs are primarily built by hard corals, which are animals, not algae (option 1 is incorrect). Corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, not zooplankton (option 2 is incorrect). Coral reefs thrive in warm, shallow, clear, and sunlit waters, not cold, deep waters (option 3 is incorrect). Coral reefs are known for their exceptionally high biodiversity, supporting a quarter of all marine life (option 4 is incorrect). Ocean acidification is a major threat to coral reefs, contributing to bleaching and hindering their growth (option 5 is correct). Understanding the complex biology and threats to coral reefs is essential for effective conservation strategies.  The incorrect pairs highlight common misunderstandings about coral reef ecosystems.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Hydrogen Production             Associated Greenhouse Gas Emission
1.  Blue Hydrogen                          :   Methane
2.  Grey Hydrogen                           :   Carbon Dioxide
3.  Green Hydrogen                         :   Water Vapor
4.  Brown Hydrogen                         :   Nitrous Oxide
5.  Black Hydrogen                         :   Carbon Monoxide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Blue hydrogen production involves using natural gas, releasing methane during the process (option 1 is incorrect). Grey hydrogen production relies on natural gas steam reforming, resulting in significant carbon dioxide emissions (option 2 is correct). Green hydrogen production uses renewable energy sources like solar or wind power, producing only water vapor as a byproduct (option 3 is correct).  Brown hydrogen uses coal gasification, which releases significant greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane and is not primarily associated with Nitrous Oxide (option 4 is incorrect).  Black hydrogen is produced from coal and releases carbon monoxide along with other pollutants (option 5 is incorrect).  The differences in greenhouse gas emissions associated with various hydrogen production methods highlight the importance of selecting sustainable pathways for hydrogen energy.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Environmental Concept                       Description
1.  Gape Limitation                           :   Predator size influencing prey selection
2.  Megafauna                                 :   Animals weighing less than 50 kg
3.  Stromatolites                              :   Exclusively terrestrial microbial communities
4.  Environmental DNA (eDNA)               :   Organismal DNA released into the environment
5.  Speciation                                :   Formation of new species through geographic isolation only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only options 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Gape limitation accurately describes how a predator's mouth size restricts the size of prey it can consume (option 1 is correct). Environmental DNA (eDNA) refers to the genetic material shed by organisms into their surroundings, a valuable tool in biodiversity assessment (option 4 is correct). Megafauna comprises animals exceeding a certain weight threshold (generally above 50 kg), making option 2 incorrect. Stromatolites are microbial communities associated with layered rock formations, found in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, making option 3 incorrect. While geographic isolation is a key mechanism in speciation (allopatric speciation), other modes of speciation exist (sympatric, parapatric, etc.), making option 5 incorrect.  Understanding these ecological concepts is important for comprehending biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics, and conservation efforts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    IUCN Red List Category                    Description
1.  Extinct                                   :   Species known to exist in the wild
2.  Extinct in the Wild                       :   Species only surviving in captivity
3.  Critically Endangered                    :   Species facing extremely high risk of extinction

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) is indeed a proposed climate finance goal post-2025, following the unmet $100 billion annual target. This makes option 2 correct.  However, NDCs are not directly related to the Adaptation Fund; they are national plans for climate action encompassing both mitigation and adaptation, making option 1 incorrect. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is associated with the Paris Agreement, not the Kyoto Protocol, making option 3 incorrect. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the intricacies of the Paris Agreement and its financial mechanisms, highlighting the need to differentiate between similar concepts and their functions. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options makes the question challenging and reveals the depth of a candidate's knowledge.


**4. With reference to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), consider the following pairs:**

   GEF-Related Fund/Program              Key Focus Area/Characteristic
1. Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF)  :   Supports National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs)
2. Global Biodiversity Framework Fund (GBFF):   Great Green Wall initiative
3. Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF)     :   Combats desertification
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The LDCF indeed assists Least Developed Country Parties in developing and implementing NAPAs.  This makes pair 1 correctly matched.  However, the GBFF focuses on biodiversity, not directly on the Great Green Wall (though projects under the GBFF might support it), making pair 2 incorrect. The SCCF addresses climate change broadly, including technology transfer and adaptation, not specifically combating desertification, making pair 3 incorrect. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific GEF-related funds and their areas of focus.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, closely related to the correct answers but subtly inaccurate, makes it a challenging question, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts within the GEF framework.

   Fungal Characteristic                     Example
1. Cell wall with Chitin                   :   Penicillin
2. Saprophytic Nutrition                   :   Mushrooms
3. Mycorrhizal Association                :   Yeast
4.  Decomposer Role                        :   Molds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because  fungi indeed possess cell walls made of chitin (a complex carbohydrate).  Penicillin, an antibiotic, is derived from a fungus but isn't a characteristic itself.  Mushrooms are a prime example of saprophytic fungi, deriving their nutrition from decaying organic matter.  Yeasts, while fungi, are not primarily known for mycorrhizal associations (symbiotic relationships with plant roots). This is a typical characteristic of other fungal groups. Molds are classic examples of decomposers in various ecosystems, playing a crucial role in nutrient cycling.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of fungal characteristics with their examples.  Understanding the diverse roles and characteristics of fungi is essential for comprehending their ecological significance and applications in various fields, including medicine and environmental remediation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Focus Area
1. IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) :   Biosphere Reserves
2. Global Fungal Red List Initiative             :   Fungal Conservation
3.  UNEP                                          :   Air Quality Management
4.  World Meteorological Organization (WMO)     :   Cryosphere Climate


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). The IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) focuses on fungal conservation, not biosphere reserves. While biosphere reserves are relevant to biodiversity conservation, they are not the primary focus of FunCC.  The Global Fungal Red List Initiative directly addresses the assessment and conservation of fungal species. UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme, plays a significant role in various environmental initiatives, including air quality management.  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is primarily concerned with weather, climate, and related geophysical events, which includes aspects of the cryosphere (frozen parts of the Earth).  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatched organizational focus areas.  Understanding the roles of these different international organizations is crucial for comprehending global efforts in biodiversity conservation and environmental protection.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue                             Mitigation/Control Strategy

3.  Mercury Pollution                             :   Minamata Convention
4.  Plastic Pollution                            :   Biocovers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  Liming is a well-established method for managing soil acidification by neutralizing the acidity. The Minamata Convention is an international treaty specifically designed to address mercury pollution and its harmful effects on human health and the environment.  Biocovers are not a direct mitigation strategy for soil acidification, nor are they directly related to plastic pollution in the way that other strategies, such as recycling or waste reduction, are.  Fugitive methane emissions from old dumpsites are addressed through biocovers, a microbial methane oxidation system.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain mismatched pairs of environmental issues and their mitigation or control strategies.  A strong understanding of these environmental challenges and their management strategies is crucial for effective environmental policies and sustainable practices.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Bisphenol A (BPA)                             :   Impaired Brain Development
3. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)   :   Kidney Dysfunction
4. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)          :   Endocrine Disruption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer.  Exposure to Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) has been linked to kidney dysfunction through disruptions in gut microbiota. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are known for their endocrine-disrupting properties, leading to various health problems.  While BPA can have developmental effects, impaired brain development is more strongly associated with exposure to DCPA during fetal development. Cardiovascular disease is not the primary health impact directly associated with BPA. Thus, options (a), (b), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing.  Understanding the specific health impacts of various pollutants is crucial for public health protection and effective risk management.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                         Primary Goal

2. CO2-to-Methanol Conversion                 :   Carbon Capture and Utilization
3.  Superhydrophobic Catalysts                  :   Biodiesel Production Enhancement
4.  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) :   Climate Change Mitigation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). CO2-to-Methanol conversion focuses on capturing carbon dioxide emissions and utilizing them to produce methanol, a valuable chemical and potential fuel.  Superhydrophobic catalysts are designed to enhance biodiesel production by improving the efficiency of the process and handling water byproducts.  Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) aims to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, not directly related to methane oxidation. BRSR is concerned with business sustainability reporting, not directly focused on climate change mitigation (though it may include relevant disclosures). Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatched pairs of technologies and their primary goals.  Understanding these technologies and their applications is vital for developing effective strategies to address climate change and promote sustainable practices.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Appiko Movement                    :   Medha Patkar
4. Narmada Bachao Andolan           :   Panduranga Hegde

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chipko movement, while having many leaders including Sunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt, is intrinsically linked to Amrita Devi Bishnoi's 18th-century act of self-sacrifice to protect trees.  This act laid the philosophical foundation for the later, more widely known, Chipko movement.  Therefore, pairing Amrita Devi with the Chipko movement is historically accurate, representing its roots.  The Silent Valley movement was primarily against the construction of a hydroelectric dam and was not directly led by Sunderlal Bahuguna, although he was a prominent environmental activist involved in many movements.  The Appiko movement was led by Panduranga Hegde in Karnataka's Western Ghats, not Medha Patkar who famously led the Narmada Bachao Andolan.  Medha Patkar's leadership of the Narmada Bachao Andolan is well-documented. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly link leaders to movements, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of these critical environmental struggles in India.


**2. With reference to the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

Project Name                       Focus Area

2. Project Dolphin                   :   Protection of wildlife outside protected areas
3. Project Elephant                  :   Support to protected areas (national parks, etc.)
4. Species Recovery Program          :   Recovery programs for saving critically endangered species and habitats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger is specifically designed for the conservation of tigers, a critically endangered species. The Species Recovery Program, as a component of IDWH, explicitly focuses on recovery programs for critically endangered species and their habitats.  Project Dolphin's primary goal is the conservation of the Gangetic river dolphin, but the scheme also addresses broader wildlife protection outside designated protected areas.  Project Elephant primarily supports protected areas, focusing on elephant habitats and corridors.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the specific focus of at least one project, highlighting a need for precise knowledge of individual conservation initiatives within the IDWH framework.  Understanding the nuances of each project is crucial for comprehending India’s comprehensive approach to wildlife conservation.

1. Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 :   India ranked 176 out of 180 countries
2. Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024    :   India surpassed China as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2
3. UN-REDD Report                  :   Only 8 of the top 20 countries with highest tropical deforestation rates have quantified forest targets in their NDCs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The EPI 2024 indeed ranked India 176th out of 180 countries, reflecting its environmental performance across various indicators.  The UN-REDD report accurately highlighted the limited number of countries with quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The statement about India surpassing China as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2 is incorrect;  while India's emissions are significant, this specific finding is associated with a different report or dataset. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair related to the UN-REDD report. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair about the NCI. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the factually inaccurate statement regarding SO2 emissions.  A thorough understanding of various environmental indices and reports is essential for analyzing global and national environmental trends.


**4. With reference to environmental legislation and organizations, consider the following pairs:**

Legislation/Organization           Key Function/Responsibility
1. Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 :   Formation of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
2. Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981      :   Implementation of e-flow ecological monitoring system
3. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)                   :   Implementation of legislations relating to environmental pollution
4. National Green Tribunal (NGT)                            :   Oversees the implementation of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is the foundational legislation for the establishment of the CPCB. The CPCB, along with State Pollution Control Boards, is indeed responsible for implementing environmental pollution control legislation. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, does not directly relate to the e-flow monitoring system; that's a more recent initiative under the Jal Shakti Ministry. The NGT deals with environmental disputes and doesn't directly oversee the Biological Diversity Act; that's the responsibility of the National Biodiversity Authority. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly link functions to acts or organizations, indicating a need for more precise knowledge of environmental governance structures in India. A clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various environmental bodies and legislation is crucial for effective environmental management.

2. Arunachal Pradesh              :  < 33.7% increase in total glacial lake surface area
3. Uttarakhand                      :  >40% increase in surface area of at least one lake
4. Himachal Pradesh                :  >40% increase in surface area of at least one lake
5. Jammu & Kashmir                :  No significant expansion mentioned in the provided text

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that the regions with the most notable expansions of glacial lakes (2011-2024) include Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.  It further specifies that 67 lakes identified in India experienced an over 40% increase in surface area. While the text doesn't provide exact percentage increases for each state individually, it's clear that Sikkim, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh experienced significant expansion exceeding 40% in at least some of their glacial lakes.  Arunachal Pradesh is mentioned as a region with expansion, but the degree of increase is not specified to be over 40%. Jammu and Kashmir is not explicitly mentioned as having experienced significant expansion in the provided text. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are definitively correctly matched based on the available information.  Option (a) is incorrect because it omits Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes Arunachal Pradesh, for which the extent of expansion is not specified as exceeding 40%. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes Jammu & Kashmir, which is not mentioned as having significant expansion.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Glacial Lake              Characteristics
1. Moraine-dammed                  :  Water dammed by ice
2. Ice-dammed                       :  Water dammed by material left by a moving glacier
3. Erosion                           :  Water dammed in depressions formed by erosion
4. Other glacial lakes               :  Water dammed by a combination of ice and moraine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly defines Moraine-dammed lakes as those where water is dammed by moraine (material left behind by a moving glacier), Ice-dammed lakes as those where water is dammed by ice, and Erosion lakes as those where water is dammed in depressions formed by erosion.  Pair 3 correctly matches the type of glacial lake with its characteristic. Pair 1 incorrectly describes a Moraine-dammed lake as being dammed by ice; it's dammed by moraine. Pair 2 incorrectly describes an Ice-dammed lake as being dammed by moraine; it's dammed by ice. Pair 4 is an overgeneralization and not a precise description of a specific glacial lake type. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   GLOF Event                         Location & River Affected
1. 2013 GLOF                          :  South Lhonak, Sikkim; Teesta III Dam
2. 2023 GLOF                          :  Chorabari Lake, Uttarakhand; Mandakini River
3.  Unspecified GLOF event            :  Chungthang, Sikkim; Teesta River

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text provides two specific examples of GLOFs: the 2013 event in Chorabari Lake, Uttarakhand, affecting the Mandakini River, and the 2023 event at South Lhonak, Sikkim, which destroyed the Teesta III Dam. Pair 2 accurately reflects the 2013 event. Pair 1 incorrectly associates the 2023 South Lhonak GLOF with the 2013 Chorabari event. Pair 3 is vague and is not directly supported by the text, although the Teesta River is implied to be connected to the South Lhonak area.  Therefore, only Pair 2 is correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cause of GLOFs                      Specific Example/Mechanism
1.  Earthquake                         :   Glacial Surging
2.  Mass movement into glacial lakes  :   Moraine dam instability
3.  Excessive precipitation             :   Ice dam failure
4. Cryoseism                           :   Breach of moraine dams

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text lists several causes of GLOFs, including geological factors (earthquakes, breach of moraine dams), morphological factors (mass movement into glacial lakes, water seepage), physical factors (excessive precipitation, cryoseism), glacial surging, moraine dam instability, and ice dam failure. Pair 2 correctly links mass movement into glacial lakes with moraine dam instability. Pair 3 correctly links excessive precipitation with ice dam failure. Pair 4 correctly links cryoseism (non-tectonic seismic events) with the potential for breaching moraine dams. Pair 1 incorrectly links earthquakes to glacial surging; while earthquakes can indirectly trigger glacial surging, it's not a direct causal link as presented in the pair. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Initiative for GLOF Management        Specific Action/Focus
1. National Disaster Management Authority Guidelines for GLOFs : Review of dam design floods

3.  High-Level Committee Chaired by the Union Home Minister    : GLOF studies mandatory for new dams
4. Centre's Early Warning System Initiative                   : Status of glacial lakes in Sikkim Himalayas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text mentions several Indian initiatives for GLOF management.  The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) provides guidelines, which include a review of dam design floods. A High-Level Committee focuses on mitigation projects, including making GLOF studies mandatory for new dams. The Centre's initiative focuses on establishing early warning systems. The NMHS contributes to understanding glacial lake status, but the primary focus of NMHS is broader than just early warning systems. Pair 2 wrongly assigns the Early warning systems to NMHS. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

5.  Rann of Kutch                             :   Gujarat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Exercise AIKYA, a joint disaster preparedness exercise by the National Disaster Management Authority and the Indian Army's Southern Command, is indeed hosted in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.  Kalbaishaki is a local name for Nor'westers, severe thunderstorms prevalent in Bengal. Kallakkadal refers to coastal flooding on the southwest coast of India, specifically affecting Kerala and Tamil Nadu.  The High Seas, as defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), are the areas beyond national jurisdiction, representing the global commons. Finally, the Rann of Kutch is a large salt marsh located in Gujarat, India.  All the pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the accurate choice. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Oceanographic Phenomenon                     Impact/Characteristic

2. La Niña                                      :   Stronger monsoons in India
3. Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD)                 :   Dead zones and ocean hypoxia
4.  GLOFs                                      : Increased surface area of glacial lakes in Himalayas
5.  Cyclones in Southeast Asia                  :   Form closer to coasts due to warmer SSTs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

El Niño is known to suppress rainfall in India during the monsoon season. La Niña, conversely, often leads to stronger monsoons and above-average rainfall.  Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD) results in the creation of dead zones and ocean hypoxia due to reduced oxygen levels. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are directly linked to the expansion of glacial lakes in the Himalayas, as evidenced by reports showing a significant increase in their surface area.  Finally, warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are contributing to cyclones in Southeast Asia forming closer to the coasts, intensifying faster, and lingering longer over land. All five pairs accurately reflect the given phenomena and their associated impacts or characteristics, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly omit at least one of these correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cyclone-Related Term/Scale                    Description/Feature
1. Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale       :   Classifies tropical cyclones into five categories based on wind speed
2. IMD's colour-coded weather warnings     :   Uses green, yellow, orange, and red alerts for cyclone-prone areas
3.  Tropical Cyclone Regional Body (TCRB)     :   Assigns names to tropical cyclones in North Indian Ocean
4.  World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)  :  Establishes the process for naming cyclones
5.  "Eye" of a Cyclone                          :  Region of calm with subsiding air within a cyclone


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is indeed used to categorize hurricanes (and by extension, other tropical cyclones) based on wind speed. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) employs a color-coded warning system, employing green, yellow, orange, and red alerts to convey the severity and timing of cyclone threats. The Tropical Cyclone Regional Body (TCRB) is responsible for assigning names to cyclones within specific ocean basins.  The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) sets the overall framework and processes for naming tropical cyclones.  Finally, the "eye" of a cyclone is a region of relatively calm winds and subsiding air at the center of the storm. All the pairs are correctly matched, hence option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization/Initiative                        Focus/Objective
1. Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) : Climate-resilient infrastructure
2.  National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF):  Developing a research testbed for Nor'westers
3.  Central Water Commission (CWC)            :   Monitoring expansion of Himalayan glacial lakes
4.  International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT):  Arctic environmental change research
5.  Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR):  Assessing impact of climate change on agriculture



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CDRI's core mission is to promote the development of climate-resilient infrastructure. The NCMRWF, along with other agencies, is involved in establishing a research testbed to study Nor'westers. The CWC has conducted research and released reports on the expansion of Himalayan glacial lakes. INTERACT focuses on research related to environmental changes in the Arctic region. While ICAR's work indirectly relates to climate change impacts, its primary focus is not solely on this aspect. Therefore, only the first four pairs are definitively and directly matched to their descriptions. Option (c) is thus the correct answer. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes a pair that is not entirely accurate in its direct focus. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Climate-Related Term/Concept                  Description/Feature
1. ENSO-Neutral Phase                            :   Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Pacific are close to average
2.  Global Stocktake (GST)                       :   A process to assess collective progress towards Paris Agreement goals
3.  Planetary Boundaries                          :   Limits to human impacts on the Earth system
4.  Heat Budget of the Earth                     :  Balance between incoming and outgoing heat
5.  Global distillation/“grasshopper effect”     : Transport of chemicals from lower latitudes to the Arctic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ENSO-neutral phase is characterized by tropical Pacific SSTs near average values. The Global Stocktake (GST) is a mechanism for evaluating progress toward the Paris Agreement's climate goals.  Planetary boundaries are defined limits beyond which human activities risk destabilizing the Earth system. The Earth's heat budget represents the equilibrium between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation. The "grasshopper effect" or global distillation describes the atmospheric and oceanic transport of chemicals from lower latitudes to higher latitudes, such as the Arctic.  All five pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to the High Seas Treaty (BBNJ Agreement), consider the following pairs:**

    Treaty Provision                                    Description
    1.  Area of Application                            :   Territorial Seas up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline
    2.  Main Decision-Making Body                    :   International Seabed Authority (ISA)
    3.  One of the Objective                         :   Conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction
    4.  One of the Key Implementing Agreements under UNCLOS :   1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The BBNJ Agreement, or High Seas Treaty, focuses on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), which includes the high seas.  Option 3 correctly reflects this primary objective.  Option 4 is also correct; the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement is one of the existing implementing agreements under UNCLOS, alongside the 1994 Part XI Implementation Agreement. Option 1 is incorrect because the ABNJ does *not* include territorial seas; territorial seas extend up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, while ABNJ begins beyond the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which extends to 200 nautical miles. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is associated with the seabed, not the overall governance structure of the BBNJ Agreement.  The main decision-making body of the BBNJ Agreement is the Conference of the Parties (COP). Therefore, option 2 is also incorrect.


**2. With reference to Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD) and Planetary Boundaries, consider the following pairs:**

    Factor Contributing to AD                            Description
    1.  Global Warming                               :   Decreases the solubility of oxygen in water
    2.  Eutrophication                                  :   Leads to algal blooms and increased oxygen consumption
    3.  Warm surface layers in the ocean              :   Prevent oxygen from mixing deeper into the ocean, leading to low oxygen levels in deep sea waters
    4.  Transgressed Planetary Boundaries             :   Climate Change, Novel Entities, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, Atmospheric Aerosol Loading, Ocean Acidification

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Aquatic deoxygenation (AD) is a decline in oxygen levels in water bodies.  Options 1, 2, and 3 correctly identify factors contributing to AD: global warming reduces oxygen solubility, eutrophication leads to algal blooms consuming oxygen, and warm surface layers hinder oxygen mixing.  Option 4 is incorrect because while climate change is a transgressed planetary boundary, the list of transgressed boundaries provided is incomplete; it excludes, for example, biosphere integrity and land-system change.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Antarctic Treaty, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of the Antarctic Treaty                          Description
    1.  Year Signed                                      :   1961
    2.  Number of Consultative Parties (as of a certain point in time) :   57
    3.  Applicability Area                               :   Area south of 60° South latitude
    4.  One of the Key Provisions                        :   Prohibits nuclear explosions and radioactive waste disposal in Antarctica

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3 and 4 only
    (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959 and entering into force in 1961, applies to the area south of 60° South latitude. One of its key provisions prohibits nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive waste in Antarctica.  Therefore, options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option 1 is incorrect because the treaty was signed in 1959, not 1961. Option 2 is incorrect because the total number of parties to the treaty is 57, but not all are consultative parties.  The number of consultative parties is significantly less than 57.


**4. With reference to the Global Geoparks Network (GGN), consider the following pairs:**

    Geopark                                             Location
    1.  Land of Extinct Volcanoes                       :   Brazil
    2.  Impact Crater Lake                             :   Finland
    3.  Uberaba                                        :   Poland

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Geoparks Network (GGN) includes geoparks from various countries.  Impact Crater Lake is located in Finland.  Options 1 and 3 are incorrect; the Land of Extinct Volcanoes geopark is in Poland, and Uberaba is in Brazil. Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS), consider the following pairs:**

    IndOOS Feature                                   Description
    1.  Type of Instrument Used                        :   Moored Buoy
    2.  One of the Objectives                          :   To understand and forecast the monsoon
    3.  Year Established                               :   1947
    4.  Data Collected                                 :   Oceanographic and marine meteorological data

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS) uses moored buoys as instruments to collect oceanographic and marine meteorological data. One of its objectives is to understand and forecast the monsoon.  IndOOS was established in 2006, not 1947. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, while option 3 is incorrect.


**6. With reference to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), consider the following pairs:**

    SFDRR Aspect                                        Description
    1.  Year Adopted                                   :   2015
    2.  One of the Priorities                           :   Substantial reduction in disaster risk
    3.  Location of Adoption                           :   Sendai, Japan
    4.  One of the Targets to be Achieved by 2030      :   Substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) was adopted in 2015 in Sendai, Japan.  Its priorities include a substantial reduction in disaster risk, and one of its targets is to substantially increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies by 2030.  Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) and their impact, consider the following pairs:**

    MHW Related Fact                                  Description
    1.  Duration                                       :   Can last for weeks, months, or even years
    2.  One of the Impacts                           :   Coral bleaching
    3.  One of the Contributing Factors                :   Changes in ocean currents and excessive heat transfer into the atmosphere
    4.  Research Institute Involved in Studying MHWs  :   ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can last for extended periods—weeks, months, or even years.  They cause coral bleaching, and changes in ocean currents and excessive heat transfer into the atmosphere contribute to their formation. The ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) is involved in studying the impact of MHWs, particularly in the context of coral bleaching. Therefore, all four pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), consider the following pairs:**

    GLOF Related Fact                                  Description
    1.  One of the Locations Prone to GLOFs          :   Uttarakhand
    2.  One of the Causes                             :   Breach of moraine dams
    3.  Organization Studying GLOFs                  :   Central Water Commission (CWC)
    4.  One of the Recent GLOF Events                 :   2013 GLOF in Chorabari glacial lake

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Uttarakhand is one of the regions prone to GLOFs.  Breaches in moraine dams are a cause of GLOFs. The Central Water Commission (CWC) studies GLOFs. The 2013 Chorabari glacial lake GLOF is a documented event. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Coral Bleaching, consider the following pairs:**

    Coral Bleaching Related Fact                         Description
    1.  One of the Affected Areas                       :   Lakshadweep Islands
    2.  One of the Coral Species Affected               :   Acropora muricata
    3.  Growth Condition for Coral Reefs                :   Cold, shallow marine waters
    4.  One of the Impacts                             :   Decrease in live coral cover

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lakshadweep Islands have experienced coral bleaching. Acropora muricata is among the coral species affected by bleaching. One impact of coral bleaching is a decrease in live coral cover.  However, the growth condition for coral reefs is warm, not cold, shallow marine waters.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to Cyclones in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Cyclone Related Fact                               Description
    1.  Region with More Frequent Cyclones             :   Arabian Sea
    2.  IMD Colour Code for Cyclone Alert               :   Yellow
    3.  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Category 5 :   Wind speed 119-153 km/hr
    4.  One of the Possible Reasons for Increased Cyclone Frequency on Western Coast :   Warming of Indian Ocean

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

More cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal, not the Arabian Sea.  The IMD uses a yellow color code for Cyclone Alert.  A Category 5 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale has wind speeds of 252 km/hr or higher, not 119-153 km/hr.  Warming of the Indian Ocean is one of the possible reasons for increased cyclone frequency on the western coast. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Mission                                      Key Feature/Objective
1. National Coal Gasification Mission                : Aims to achieve coal gasification and liquefaction of 50 MT of coal by 2030
2. Scheme for promotion of Coal/Lignite Gasification : Primarily targets government PSUs for financial assistance
3. National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF)      : Initially covered 10 lakh hectares in 500 major blocks
4. Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY)           :  A six-year scheme launched in 2019 that includes NMNF as a sub-scheme
5.  Smart Cities Mission (SCM)                      :  Initially targeted 50 cities for smart solutions implementation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the information provided. The National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF), initially known as Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP),  was a Centrally Sponsored Scheme initiated for a period of six years (2019-25).  While the exact initial target area isn't precisely mentioned as 10 lakh hectares and 500 blocks, the overall timeframe and objective are correct. It is important to note that the NMNF was made a sub-scheme under the umbrella scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY) in 2019.  This makes pair 4 correct. The other pairs contain inaccuracies. The National Coal Gasification Mission aims for 100 MT, not 50 MT, of coal gasification and liquefaction by 2030. The Scheme for promotion of Coal/Lignite Gasification explicitly includes the private sector, not just government PSUs. The Smart Cities Mission initially covered 100 cities, not 50.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the facts presented.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                                  Mandate/Function
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)              : Primarily responsible for implementing air pollution control legislation
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)                        :  Deals exclusively with environmental compensation cases
3. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)                   : Oversees the implementation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
4. Committee for Air Quality Management                :  Focuses solely on air quality improvement in Delhi-NCR
5.  FloodWatch India Application                        :  Disseminates flood information and forecasts up to 3 days on a real-time basis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The CPCB is a statutory body with responsibilities under both the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, making the first pair partially correct.  FloodWatch India Application provides real-time flood information and forecasts up to 7 days, not 3. The NGT handles a wide range of environmental cases, not just environmental compensation.  The CGWB is responsible for groundwater management, not directly for implementing the 1974 Water Act. The Committee for Air Quality Management has a broader scope than just Delhi-NCR.  Therefore, only the first pair (CPCB) and the fifth pair (FloodWatch India Application) are partially correct due to minor inaccuracies in the descriptions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                        Key Feature/Finding
1. SDG India Index 2023-24                             :  Kerala ranked highest among states
2. SDGs – National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress Report, 2024 : Primarily focuses on state-level progress
3. Sustainable Development Report 2024                 : Ranks countries based on their engagement with the UN system
4. Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)              : Uttarakhand is the only state to implement it
5.  Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India : Shows a decline in built-up land since 2005


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is entirely correct. Uttarakhand was indeed the first Indian state to launch a Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI). The other pairs contain inaccuracies. The SDG India Index 2023-24 does not show Kerala as the highest-ranked state; the report shows Uttarakhand and Kerala at the top.  The NIF Progress Report focuses on national-level progress, not just state-level.  The Sustainable Development Report does not rank countries based on UN engagement; a separate index, the New Index of Support to UN-based Multilateralism (UN-Mi), does this.  The Annual Land Use and Land Cover Atlas shows an increase, not a decrease, in built-up land since 2005.  Therefore, only pair 4 contains accurate information.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                      Key Focus/Objective
1. International Energy Agency (IEA)                       : Primarily promotes renewable energy technologies
2. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)          : Focuses solely on energy efficiency improvements
3. UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) :  Exclusively monitors the progress of SDG targets
4.  Climate Policy Initiative (CPI)                        :  Focuses solely on climate finance flows
5.  Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI)                 :  Develops standards only for renewable energy targets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are entirely accurate. The IEA's focus is broader than just renewable energy; it covers a wide spectrum of energy issues. IRENA focuses on renewable energy, not solely energy efficiency. UN DESA's work encompasses many aspects of sustainable development, not just SDG monitoring. CPI's work includes broader climate policy aspects, not just finance. SBTI develops standards for corporate climate targets, encompassing various emission reduction strategies, not only renewable energy.  Thus, all pairs contain oversimplifications or inaccuracies regarding the organizations' primary mandates.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Which of the following statements about the New Development Bank (NDB) is/are correct?**
    1. Its membership is limited to BRICS nations.
    2. The initial subscribed capital is $50 billion with equal contributions from founding members.
    3. It primarily focuses on projects in developed countries.
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The New Development Bank (NDB) was established by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).  While initially, membership was limited to BRICS nations, it has since expanded to include other countries. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The initial subscribed capital of the NDB was indeed $50 billion, but the contribution from founding members was not equal.  Each founding member contributed a different amount based on their respective economies. Statement 2 is partially correct regarding the total capital but incorrect about the equal contribution. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NDB primarily focuses on infrastructure and sustainable development projects in developing countries, particularly BRICS and other emerging economies.  Therefore, only statement 2 is partially correct regarding the total capital, making (b) the correct option.


2. **With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**
    1. The framework is structured around four pillars relating to Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy.
    2. Australia and New Zealand are not members of the IPEF.
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) is indeed structured around four pillars: Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy.  Statement 1 is accurate.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Australia and New Zealand are members of the IPEF.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer.


3. **Which among the following organizations have jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience?**
    (a) International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)
    (b) International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)
    (c) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and International Energy Agency (IEA)
    (d) World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Data Corporation (IDC)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience was a joint initiative of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC).  The other options represent organizations that do not have a direct role in this specific initiative, although some may be tangentially related to broader aspects of cable infrastructure or international trade.  Therefore, (a) is the only correct answer.



4. **Consider the following statements about the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD):**
    1. It was adopted in 1994 as the sole legally binding international agreement.
    2. The primary objective of the UNCCD is to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030.
    3. India hosted the 14th session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNCCD.
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNCCD was adopted in 1994, but it's not the *sole* legally binding international agreement related to environmental issues; several others exist.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  The primary objective of the UNCCD is indeed to achieve land degradation neutrality, although the specific target year might vary in different interpretations.  Statement 2 is largely correct.  India has hosted sessions of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNCCD, but whether it was the 14th session requires verification. However,  the information provided does not contradict the statement.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are more likely to be correct, making (b) the most probable answer.


5. **Which of the following statements about the African Union (AU) is not correct?**
    (a) It was established in 2001 and is a successor of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
    (b) The AU’s headquarters is located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    (c) It aims to promote peace, security, and stability in Africa.
    (d) It has 50 member states, representing all the countries in Africa.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The African Union (AU) was established in 2002 (not 2001), succeeding the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).  Statements (a), (b), and (c) are all accurate reflections of the AU's establishment, headquarters location, and primary objectives. However, statement (d) is incorrect. While the AU aims for inclusivity, the exact number of member states may fluctuate slightly over time.  The number is close to 55, representing nearly all African countries, but not precisely 50. The slight discrepancy makes (d) the incorrect statement.


6. **With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), consider the following statements:**
    1. Created in 1949, it works on the principle of collective defence.
    2. It is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NATO was created in 1949 and operates on the principle of collective defense, meaning an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect; NATO's headquarters is in Brussels, Belgium, not Vienna, Austria.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) focuses specifically on the conservation of fungal species, not plants.  The Global Fungal Red List Initiative, as its name suggests, assesses the conservation status of fungi worldwide.  The World Health Organization's (WHO) primary focus is on human and animal health and does not directly deal with fungal conservation or the assessment of fungal species.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (c) correctly identifies these matches. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude the correctly matched pairs 2 and 3.

3. Hydrogel                                       :  Binding and degrading microplastics in water bodies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Steel slag is primarily used as a base course material in road construction, improving durability and reducing the carbon footprint, not as a surface coating. Biocover, a system utilizing methanotrophic bacteria, is specifically designed to control fugitive methane emissions, primarily from landfills, and is not directly used in road construction. Hydrogel, a material with a unique polymer network, is used for microplastic removal from water sources and not road construction. Therefore, only pair 2, correctly associating biocover with its primary use in mitigating methane emissions, is accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched uses of steel slag and hydrogel.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

FERI focuses on forest ecosystem restoration, not marine ecosystems. The International Cryosphere Climate Initiative deals with cryosphere-related issues, not tropical rainforests. The Committee for Air Quality Management focuses on air quality, not groundwater. The CGWB manages groundwater resources, not air quality in Delhi-NCR specifically; that is the responsibility of other bodies.  This question assesses factual recall of organizational mandates and areas of expertise. The distractors leverage potential confusions between similar environmental concerns. All pairs are incorrectly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Phenomenon/Impact                        Characteristic/Cause
1.  Marine Heatwaves (MHWs)                             :   Primarily caused by volcanic eruptions
2.  Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)                :   Always triggered by earthquakes
3.  Oil Spills                                           :   Effectively mitigated solely by using booms and skimmers
4.  Manganese Contamination of Water                    :   Causes only neurological disorders


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

MHWs are primarily caused by changes in ocean currents and excessive heat transfer, not volcanic eruptions. GLOFs have multiple triggers, including geological events, morphological changes, and physical factors; earthquakes are not the sole cause. Oil spill mitigation involves bioremediation and other methods beyond booms and skimmers. Manganese contamination can cause cancer in addition to neurological disorders.  This question tests factual understanding of environmental phenomena and their causes and impacts.  The distractors are designed to be plausible but incorrect.  All the pairs are incorrectly matched.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Law/Policy                           Key Provision/Objective
1.  Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974:  Established the National Green Tribunal
2.  Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 :  Deals primarily with groundwater pollution
3.  Environment Protection Charge (EPC)                :  Applies only to petrol vehicles
4.  National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA): Funds only forest-related projects


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, established the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), not the NGT. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, deals with air pollution, not groundwater pollution.  The EPC applies to specified new diesel vehicles, not petrol vehicles. While CAMPA funds many forest-related projects,  its scope is not exclusively limited to forest projects; it supports afforestation and other related environmental initiatives. Therefore, only statement 4 is partially correct in that it highlights a major function of CAMPA, though not its only function.  The question tests knowledge of environmental laws and policies in India and their key features. The distractors use closely related but incorrect information to test the examinee's precise understanding.

2. Secondary microplastics           :   Tiny particles designed for commercial use
3. Microfibers                        :   Shedding from textiles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Primary microplastics are tiny plastic particles manufactured for specific purposes, such as in cosmetics or clothing.  Secondary microplastics, on the other hand, result from the breakdown of larger plastic items through various environmental processes like weathering and degradation.  Microfibers are a specific type of primary microplastic that originates from the shedding of textiles during washing or wear. Option (d) correctly identifies the sources of secondary microplastics (tiny particles for commercial use) and microfibers (shedding from textiles). Option (a) is incorrect as it incorrectly attributes the origin of primary microplastics to the breakdown of larger plastics; Option (b) is incorrect because secondary microplastics are not designed for commercial use, they are byproducts of larger plastic degradation; Option (c) is incorrect because microfibers are a subset of primary microplastics, not a separate category entirely.  Understanding the distinction between primary and secondary microplastics is crucial for effective waste management and pollution control strategies.  The environmental impact of microplastics is a significant concern, affecting marine ecosystems and potentially human health, highlighting the importance of addressing their sources and pathways.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Megacarnivores                  :   Plant-eaters
3. Megaomnivores                   :   Both plants and meat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Megafauna refers to animals exceeding a certain weight threshold (generally above 50 kg).  They are categorized based on their diet. Megaherbivores are plant-eaters, megacarnivores are meat-eaters, and megaomnivores consume both plants and meat. Option (c) correctly matches Megaomnivores with their dietary type (both plants and meat). Options (a) and (b) incorrectly reverse the dietary types of Megaherbivores and Megacarnivores. Option (d) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched.  Understanding megafauna classification and their dietary habits is essential in ecological studies, particularly concerning conservation efforts and the impacts of anthropogenic pressures, which have led to significant losses in megafauna populations, especially megaherbivores and megacarnivores, since the Late Pleistocene. The extinction of species such as woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers underscores the importance of understanding the ecological roles these animals played and the consequences of their disappearance.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Phenomenon        Description
1. Red Tides                        :   Plankton crashes due to lack of nutrients
2. Plankton Crashes                 :   Sudden change in water quality
3. Gape Limitation                 :   Physical constraint on prey size for a predator

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Red tides are caused by algal blooms that produce pigments, which stick to rocks and the sea floor, creating a biofilm-like layer. Plankton crashes can occur due to nutrient deficiency or a lack of CO2 in the initial production cycle, or due to a sudden change in water quality later in the cycle. Gape limitation is a concept in ecology that refers to the physical constraint on the size of prey that a predator can consume, primarily determined by the predator's mouth size. Option (c) correctly defines gape limitation. Options (a) and (b) incorrectly describe red tides and plankton crashes.  Option (d) is incorrect because only gape limitation is correctly matched. Understanding these ecological concepts is crucial for analyzing marine ecosystems and predator-prey dynamics.  The impact of environmental changes on plankton populations, a fundamental part of the marine food web, is significant, affecting higher trophic levels and overall ecosystem health.  The concept of gape limitation demonstrates how physical characteristics of predators shape food web structure and species interactions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Process/Phenomenon             Description/Impact
1.  Global Distillation (Grasshopper Effect) :  Accumulation of pollutants in the Arctic
2.  Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD)       :   Increased oxygen solubility in water due to warming
3.  Soil Acidification                 :   Increased availability of nutrients in soil

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The grasshopper effect describes the long-range atmospheric transport of semi-volatile organic pollutants, leading to their accumulation in polar regions like the Arctic.  Aquatic deoxygenation (AD) is the overall decline in oxygen content of oceanic and coastal waters, primarily caused by factors like global warming (which decreases oxygen solubility), warm surface layers preventing mixing, and eutrophication. Soil acidification involves a decrease in soil pH, leading to negative consequences such as nutrient loss and increased aluminum toxicity. Option (a) correctly describes the grasshopper effect. Options (b) and (c) incorrectly describe aquatic deoxygenation and soil acidification, respectively.  Option (d) is incorrect as only the grasshopper effect is accurately described.  Understanding these environmental processes is crucial for assessing the impact of pollution and climate change on various ecosystems.  The accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Arctic highlights the global nature of pollution, while aquatic deoxygenation and soil acidification underscore the local and regional impacts of human activities on water and terrestrial environments.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Concern            Description/Cause
1. Mercury Pollution                :   Phase-out of mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers

3. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) :   Increase in the use of 12 POPs since 2004

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mercury pollution is addressed through initiatives like phasing out mercury-containing devices in healthcare. Plastic Overshoot Day marks the point when plastic waste generation surpasses the world's capacity to manage it effectively. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are a group of toxic chemicals that persist in the environment, with global efforts focused on reducing their use, not increasing it. Option (c) accurately describes mercury pollution and Plastic Overshoot Day. Option (d) is incorrect because the statement about POPs is false. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because only two of the three pairs are correctly matched.  Understanding these environmental concerns is critical for formulating effective policies and strategies for pollution control and sustainable waste management. The UNEP's initiative to phase out mercury devices demonstrates a commitment to reducing mercury pollution, while the concept of Plastic Overshoot Day highlights the urgency of addressing the global plastic waste crisis.  The decline in the use of POPs since 2004 shows the effectiveness of international regulatory actions to mitigate the environmental and health risks associated with these persistent pollutants.

(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Stromatolites are microbial communities associated with rock layers, often found in extreme environments. The Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD) is the water depth at which calcium carbonate dissolution rate equals supply rate. Glacial lakes can pose a risk of GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods), but not always. Option (a) correctly describes stromatolites and CCD. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct description of CCD. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correct description of stromatolites. Option (d) is incorrect because the statement about glacial lakes is not universally true.  The study of stromatolites provides insights into early Earth environments and microbial evolution. The CCD is a key factor in understanding ocean chemistry and carbonate sedimentation, and glacial lakes are significant hydrological features in high-altitude regions.  Understanding the formation and dynamics of these geological features is important for various scientific disciplines, including paleoclimatology, oceanography, and geomorphology.  The potential for GLOFs from glacial lakes highlights the risks associated with climate change and its impact on high-altitude environments.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mycorrhizal associations are mutually beneficial relationships between fungi and plant roots. Mycoremediation involves the use of fungi to degrade pollutants.  Chile is indeed the only country that explicitly includes fungi in its conservation laws. Option (c) accurately describes mycoremediation and the role of fungi in conservation in Chile. Option (a) is incorrect because mycorrhizal associations are beneficial. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the accurate description of fungal conservation. Option (d) is incorrect because the description of mycorrhizal associations is false.  The roles of fungi in ecosystems are diverse and crucial, encompassing decomposition, nutrient cycling, symbiotic relationships, and even applications in bioremediation. The fact that Chile is the only country that legally protects fungi underscores the importance of recognizing the ecological and economic value of these organisms. The global fungal red list initiative and the IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee highlight the growing international awareness of the need for fungal conservation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 assesses countries' performance across various environmental indicators, including those related to ecosystem vitality. The Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024 uses multiple markers, including land management, to evaluate conservation efforts. The People's Biodiversity Register (PBR) is a crucial tool for documenting and safeguarding local biological resources and associated traditional knowledge.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective indices and registers. There are no discrepancies or inaccuracies in the provided pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Convention/Agreement              Characteristic
1. UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) : One of the three Rio Conventions
2. Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) :  Focuses on reducing emissions from deforestation
3. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) :  Deals with international carbon markets


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The UNCCD is indeed one of the three Rio Conventions, along with the UNFCCC and CBD.  However, the CBD's primary focus is on the conservation of biological diversity, not reducing emissions from deforestation (though deforestation impacts biodiversity and is indirectly addressed).  The UNFCCC's core objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations, not directly manage international carbon markets (although carbon markets are a tool used under the UNFCCC's framework). Therefore, only pair 1 is accurately matched. Pairs 2 and 3 present inaccurate descriptions of the conventions' primary focuses.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                    Mandate/Function
1.  International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) : Publishes the Red List of Threatened Species
2.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) : Monitors e-flow in river systems
3.  National Green Tribunal (NGT) :  Deals with environmental disputes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The IUCN is globally recognized for its Red List of Threatened Species, which assesses the conservation status of various species. The NGT is a specialized tribunal in India that deals with environmental cases and disputes. However, the CPCB's primary mandate involves monitoring and controlling pollution, not directly monitoring e-flow in river systems (although it might be involved in related aspects of water quality).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 incorrectly attributes e-flow monitoring to the CPCB.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Area/Region                          Designation/Status
1. Western Ghats                        :  Declared an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) by the Supreme Court
2. Ratapani Tiger Reserve               :  57th Tiger Reserve of India
3.  Yamuna Biodiversity Park           :  Site of a rare sighting of Wroughton's free-tailed bat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The declaration of the Western Ghats as an ESA is a complex process involving various governmental bodies and decisions,  not solely by the Supreme Court.  The Ratapani Tiger Reserve's status as the 57th tiger reserve in India is accurate. The Yamuna Biodiversity Park's association with the rare sighting of Wroughton's free-tailed bat is also factually correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 misrepresents the decision-making process regarding the Western Ghats' ESA status.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) focuses primarily on the conservation of fungal species and their habitats, not specifically on mycoremediation techniques, although that might be a related area of research for some of its members.  Mycoremediation is the use of fungi to remediate pollutants.  The Global Fungal Red List Initiative is indeed dedicated to assessing the conservation status of fungal species globally, contributing significantly to understanding fungal biodiversity and informing conservation efforts.  Chile is indeed unique amongst nations for explicitly including fungi in its national conservation legislation, reflecting a broader recognition of their ecological importance. Thus, options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option 1 is incorrect because FunCC's focus is broader than just mycoremediation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)               :  Addresses environmental disputes and violations
3.  Forest Advisory Committee (FAC)             :  Regulates groundwater extraction
4. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)          :  Approves diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is correctly matched with its primary function of addressing environmental disputes and violations.  It plays a vital role in enforcing environmental laws and regulations in India.

Pair 1 is incorrect; the CPCB is responsible for controlling pollution, not managing protected areas.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the FAC approves forest land diversion, not groundwater regulation.  Pair 4 is also incorrect; the CGWB is responsible for groundwater management, not forest land diversion.  The deliberately incorrect pairings ensure that only candidates with accurate knowledge of these organizations and their functions can answer correctly.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in environmental governance.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Conference/Convention          Key Outcome/Focus
1. UNFCCC COP29                                 :  Established the Loss and Damage Fund
2.  COP27                                       :  Finalized the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
3.  Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework :  Set goals for financing climate action in developing countries
4.  Rio Earth Summit                            :  Established the Global Environment Facility (GEF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

COP27 is correctly associated with the establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund, and the Rio Earth Summit is correctly linked to the establishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF).  These are key historical milestones in international environmental governance.

Pair 1 is incorrect; COP29 focused on the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance, not the establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund (which happened at COP27). Pair 2 is incorrect;  the finalization of Article 6 rules occurred at COP28, not COP27. Pair 3 is incorrect; while the Kunming-Montreal framework addresses biodiversity, the specific goals for financing climate action were primarily set at COP29 and related negotiations.  The incorrect options act as powerful distractors, testing the examinee's detailed knowledge of international environmental agreements and their specific outcomes.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                     Focus/Characteristic
1. Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India :  Tracks changes in built-up land area since 2005.
2. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Report to NGT :  Highlights unutilized environmental funds.
3. FloodWatch India Application                  :  Disseminates flood forecasts up to 7 days.
4. Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative     :  Aims to protect everyone from hazardous weather events by 2027.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India, released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), indeed systematically examines land utilization patterns, including a detailed analysis of the growth of built-up land since 2005.  The CPCB report to the NGT accurately highlighted the significant percentage of unutilized environmental funds. The FloodWatch India application, developed by the Central Water Commission (CWC), successfully utilizes advanced technologies to disseminate real-time flood information and forecasts. Finally, the Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative, spearheaded by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, explicitly aims to enhance early warning systems globally to protect everyone from hazardous weather, water, or climate events by the end of 2027.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue/Initiative             Key Feature/Finding

2.  UN-REDD report                           :  Highlights that only a minority of top deforestation countries have quantified forest targets in their NDCs.
3.  Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)   :  Evaluates ecological development using four pillars: air, soil, tree, and water.
4.  Nagapattinam oil spill                   :  Resulted in a ₹5 crore penalty due to no-fault liability.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Trajectory control for re-entry focuses on burning satellites at *lower* altitudes (12-18 miles) to allow for faster settling of metal oxides.  Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched. The UN-REDD report correctly points out the insufficient number of top deforestation countries with quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI) accurately uses the four pillars mentioned for evaluation.  The Nagapattinam oil spill resulted in the penalty as stated due to no-fault liability imposed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  Sustainable tourism                     :  Defined by the Cape Town Declaration (2002) and Magna Carta London (2020).
4.  Bioremediation                         :  Use of living organisms to remove oil spills.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Environment Protection Charge (EPC) is paid by the *dealer/manufacturer*, not the buyer, of specified new diesel vehicles. Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The definition of "Just Transition" accurately reflects the ILO's description.  The Cape Town Declaration (2002) and Magna Carta London (2020) are indeed key documents defining sustainable tourism.  Bioremediation correctly describes the use of living organisms for oil spill cleanup. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Area/Location               Environmental Feature/Issue
1.  Western Ghats                           :  Kasturirangan Committee recommended 37% as Eco-sensitive Area.
2.  Kutch (Gujarat)                         :  Home to Kharai camels that swim in the sea.
3.  Ladakh's Nubra Valley                   :  Habitat for Bactrian camels.
4.  Periyar and Chalakudi river basins (Kerala) :  Implementation site for CoS-it-FloWS hyperlocal flood forecasting system.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Kasturirangan Committee report indeed proposed a significant portion of the Western Ghats as an Eco-sensitive Area. Kharai camels are found in Kutch, known for their unique ability to swim. Bactrian camels are found in Ladakh's Nubra Valley. The CoS-it-FloWS project is implemented in the Periyar and Chalakudi river basins.  There are no discrepancies or inaccuracies in any of the pairings.  Each pair accurately connects a geographical location with a relevant environmental feature or issue.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Movement                     Leader/Key Figure
1. Chipko Movement                          :   Sunderlal Bahuguna
2. Silent Valley Movement                    :   Medha Patkar
3. Narmada Bachao Andolan                 :   Panduranga Hegde
4. Appiko Movement                          :   Amrita Devi Bishnoi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Chipko movement, a non-violent resistance against deforestation, prominently featured Sunderlal Bahuguna as a key leader.  While other individuals participated, Bahuguna's leadership and ideological contributions are widely recognized.  The Silent Valley Movement opposed a hydroelectric project in Kerala and did not have Medha Patkar as a central figure; she is primarily associated with the Narmada Bachao Andolan.  The Narmada Bachao Andolan, against dam construction on the Narmada river, was indeed led by Medha Patkar. Finally, the Appiko movement in Karnataka's Western Ghats was spearheaded by Panduranga Hegde.  Amrita Devi Bishnoi, while a significant figure in the history of environmental protection in India, is primarily associated with the Bishnoi movement against tree felling in the 18th century, predating the other movements listed.  Option (a) is correct because it accurately identifies the connection between the Chipko movement and Sunderlal Bahuguna. The other options incorrectly link leaders to movements they did not lead. This question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of the leaders associated with major Indian environmental movements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Renewable Energy Initiative            Key Feature/Implementation Aspect
1. National Green Hydrogen Mission      :   Focuses primarily on Geothermal Energy Development
2. Renewable Energy Research & Technology Development Programme (RE-RTD):  Provides 100% funding to all applicants

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) is a broad initiative aimed at making India a global green hydrogen hub, encompassing various aspects of production, usage, and export.  It is not solely focused on Geothermal energy. The RE-RTD program does provide 100% funding to government/non-profit organizations but only up to 70% for industries and startups. The Mission on Advanced and High-Impact Research (MAHIR) is a broader research initiative and does not exclusively address biomass briquettes.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of specific renewable energy initiatives in India, requiring them to distinguish between the actual scope and focus of each program.  The distractors are designed to test detailed knowledge and to avoid superficial understanding.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

1. FloodWatch India                                  :   Ministry of Jal Shakti
2. CoS-it-FloWS                                     :    UNICEF
3. Early Warnings for All (EW4All)                    :   Central Water Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

FloodWatch India, a mobile application disseminating flood-related information, is indeed launched by the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  CoS-it-FloWS, a hyper-local flood forecasting system, while recognized by UNICEF's Climate Tech Cohort, is primarily run by Equinoct, a Kochi-based organization.  Early Warnings for All (EW4All) is an initiative spearheaded by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, not the Central Water Commission, which is involved in FloodWatch India. Option (a) is the only correct pairing.  The other options present plausible but incorrect connections, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of environmental monitoring systems and the organizations involved.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between implementing and associated organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Water Conservation Initiative              Key Feature/Objective
1. Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari               :   Focuses solely on rainwater harvesting in urban areas
2. AMRUT 2.0                               :   Aims for universal water supply coverage only in rural areas
3. National Water Awards                     :   Presented exclusively by the President of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari initiative, while emphasizing community participation in water conservation, is not limited to urban areas and includes various water conservation methods.  AMRUT 2.0 aims for universal water supply coverage across all statutory towns (both urban and rural) and includes sewerage and septage management.  The National Water Awards are indeed presented by the President of India, but the awards are not exclusively limited to the President's presentation; other officials may also be involved in the presentation ceremony. Therefore, none of the pairs accurately reflect the key features or objectives of these initiatives. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of water conservation initiatives in India, requiring them to evaluate the accuracy of statements about their scope and objectives.  The distractors are designed to test detailed knowledge and to avoid superficial understanding.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Issue/Resource            Significant Impact/Consequence
1. Illegal Sand Mining                     :   Enhancement of biodiversity
2. Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) :   Zero carbon emissions during operation
3.  Geothermal Energy                      :   No land subsidence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Illegal sand mining leads to habitat loss and degradation of ecosystems, harming biodiversity, not enhancing it.  Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), while potentially cleaner than surface mining, still produces greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.  Geothermal energy can cause land subsidence in some cases due to extraction of fluids from underground reservoirs.  Therefore, none of the pairs accurately reflect the impacts or consequences of these environmental issues or resource utilization methods.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of environmental consequences and the ability to critically evaluate the impacts of different resource extraction and utilization methods.  The distractors are designed to test detailed knowledge and to avoid superficial understanding.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory organization established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and is also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is primarily associated with the management of groundwater resources, and while its activities indirectly relate to water pollution control, it's not directly established under the 1974 Act in the same way as the CPCB.  Hence pair 2 is partially correct but not completely in the context of the question. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, making pair 3 correct.  The Committee for Air Quality Management (CAQM) doesn't have a specific act associated with its establishment; it operates under the overall framework of environmental legislation. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CPCB is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it also functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The NGT is established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched. The Committee for Air Quality Management's mandate stems from the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), a comprehensive plan to improve air quality. Thus, pair 4 is correctly matched.  However, the CGWB doesn't directly fall under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, in the same way CPCB does; its mandate is broader, encompassing groundwater management.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Organization       Key Feature/Objective
1.  SDG India Index 2023-24                 :  Measures progress on 17 Sustainable Development Goals
2.  Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) : Released report on valuing the hydrological cycle
3.  Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund:  Supports biodiversity and climate action exclusively
4.  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) : Mandatory for top 500 listed companies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index 2023-24 indeed tracks progress on indicators aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.  The GCEW's core function is to analyze and report on the economic aspects of water resource management, including its valuation as a global common good.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  However, the GFC Fund's support extends beyond biodiversity and climate action; it specifically aims to assist low- and middle-income countries in managing chemicals and waste safely and sustainably.  BRSR is mandatory for the top 1000 listed companies, not 500.  Thus, pairs 3 and 4 are incorrectly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include these incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Environmental Index/Report                 Source/Organization
1.  Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)     :   Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change
2.  2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) :  New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch
3.  EnviStats                                   :   United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report is indeed a collaborative effort between the New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch.  The NCAVES initiative is a collaboration between the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), UNEP and Secretariat of CBD.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. However, the GEPI was initially launched by Uttarakhand state, not the national Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change.  EnviStats were released in India based on recommendations of the Sir Partha Dasgupta Committee, not directly by UNSD. Thus, pairs 1 and 3 are incorrectly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include these incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Policy/Initiative            Key characteristic

2.  Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS)    :  Includes both compliance and offset mechanisms
3.  Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme :  Based on trading of energy saving certificates (ESCerts)
4.  Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) Scheme:  Aimed at promoting fossil fuel energy sources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS) indeed incorporates both compliance and offset mechanisms for greenhouse gas emissions. The Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme does operate through the trading of energy saving certificates (ESCerts). Thus, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. However, the Green Credits Programme has a broader scope than just afforestation; it encourages various sustainable practices. The REC scheme is specifically designed to promote renewable energy, not fossil fuels.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are incorrectly matched. Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Disaster Management Initiative/Program     Key Feature/Agency
1. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) :  Focuses solely on flood relief efforts
2. FloodWatch India application             :  Developed by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
3. Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative:  Aims to protect everyone from hazardous weather events by 2027
4. National Water Awards (NWA)            :  Presented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative aims to provide early warning systems to protect everyone from hazardous weather, water, or climate events by 2027. The National Water Awards are indeed presented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. However, NDRF's role extends beyond just flood relief to a wide range of disasters.  The FloodWatch India application is developed by the Central Water Commission (CWC), not the IMD.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include these incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Himalayan State/UT                 Vulnerable Glacial Lake
1. Uttarakhand                         Chorabari Lake
2. Sikkim                              Tenchungkha Lake
3. Ladakh                              Pangong Tso Lake (partially glacial)
4. Himachal Pradesh                   Suraj Tal Lake


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Chorabari Lake in Uttarakhand experienced a GLOF in 2013, leading to devastating floods in the Mandakini River. This event is well-documented and serves as a significant example of the risks posed by glacial lakes in the Himalayas.  Tenchungkha Lake in Sikkim experienced a GLOF in 2023, which impacted the Teesta III Dam.  While Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh is partially glacial, it's not primarily known for GLOF events in the same way as Chorabari and Tenchungkha. Similarly, Suraj Tal Lake in Himachal Pradesh, although a high-altitude lake, is not prominently linked to GLOF events in the provided context.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 represent accurate pairings of Himalayan states/UTs and vulnerable glacial lakes known for GLOF events. Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the Sikkim-Tenchungkha pair. Options (c) and (d) incorrectly include lakes not primarily associated with major GLOF events in the specified regions. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between glacial lakes with documented GLOF histories and other high-altitude lakes.

(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Water Commission (CWC) is responsible for the management of surface water resources in India, while the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) handles groundwater resources.  The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) leads the HKH cryosphere initiative focusing on glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the Himalayas. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is a global initiative under the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), not UNESCO specifically, although UNESCO contributes to its implementation.  Therefore, only pair 3 correctly matches the organization with its function.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the roles of these organizations. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the functions of different organizations involved in water resource management and disaster risk reduction.

3. GLOFs                                   :   Uttarakhand (Mandakini River)
4. Drought                                 :   Bihar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While illegal sand mining is a widespread problem across India, including Kerala, the provided context emphasizes the Supreme Court's action regarding illegal sand mining in Tamil Nadu. The Nagapattinam oil spill in Tamil Nadu is explicitly mentioned. The 2013 GLOF in Uttarakhand's Mandakini River is a well-known event.  While drought affects many parts of India, including Bihar, the question's focus is on specific events in the given context. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 represent accurate pairings of environmental issues and affected states/regions. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the drought in Bihar. Options (b) and (d) incorrectly include the statement about illegal sand mining in Kerala, which, while true, is not the primary focus within the given context. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to link specific environmental events to their locations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) :   North East Region


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Paira cropping system is primarily practiced in Odisha, not Tamil Nadu.  Green manuring using Dhaincha is mentioned in the context of Tamil Nadu.  Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) initiatives are specifically highlighted in relation to the North East Region. Therefore, only pair 3 correctly links the sustainable practice with its location. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the geographical distribution of these agricultural practices. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to associate sustainable agricultural practices with their regions of implementation.

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve holds the distinction of being the first Biosphere Reserve in India to receive recognition under the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme of UNESCO.  The Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve is indeed situated in West Bengal, known for its unique mangrove ecosystem and tiger population. The Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve encompasses a substantial marine component, showcasing the diversity of its coastal and oceanic environments.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

Option (d) is incorrect because while the Western Ghats are a significant biodiverse region and contain multiple biosphere reserves, there's no single largest biosphere reserve encompassing the entire Western Ghats region.  The statement implies a single, unified reserve, which is not factually accurate.  Option (a) is incomplete, missing the correct pairing of Great Nicobar. Option (c) is also incomplete, failing to include the accurate pairings of Sundarbans and Great Nicobar.


2. **With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    ESZ related Entity/Concept          Characteristic/Feature

    2.  UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS): Provides a comprehensive legal framework for oceans
    3.  Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW):  Focused solely on freshwater resources
    4.  IPBES                             :  A UN body


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The BBNJ Agreement is specifically designed to address the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. UNCLOS is a comprehensive international treaty that sets the legal framework for the use and management of the world's oceans.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.

Option (a) is correct because pairs 3 and 4 are incorrect. The GCEW's scope is broader than just freshwater; it considers the entire hydrological cycle.  IPBES, while collaborating with the UN, is not a UN body itself. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of these false pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Governing Act/Authority
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)        :   Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)                 :   Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
3. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)           :   Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
4. Committee for Air Quality Management       :   NITI Aayog


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.  The other pairs are incorrect. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is not governed by either the Water or Air Pollution Acts; it's an independent statutory body. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) isn't governed by the Air Pollution Act; it falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Finally, the Committee for Air Quality Management is not under NITI Aayog; its governance structure is distinct from those listed.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure and legal framework governing various environmental bodies in India.  Incorrect options include plausible distractors, testing the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of each organization. The subtle differences between the actual governing bodies and the distractors highlight the need for precise knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Program            Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Namami Gange                               :   Focuses solely on the Ganga River
2. National Water Awards                       :   Presented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti
3.  United Nations Water Convention            :   India is a signatory party
4. E-flow Monitoring System                    :   Developed by the Wildlife Institute of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The National Water Awards are indeed presented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti. The other options are incorrect.  Namami Gange's scope extends beyond just the Ganga River to include its tributaries. The United Nations Water Convention does not have India as a signatory party. Finally, the e-flow monitoring system was developed by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), not the Wildlife Institute of India. This question assesses detailed knowledge about specific environmental programs and their characteristics.  Incorrect options serve as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge to correctly identify the accurate match.  The inclusion of both national and international initiatives tests the candidate's broader understanding of water resource management.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Organization/Body          Primary Function/Mandate
1. International Solar Alliance (ISA)         :  Promoting renewable energy technologies in Africa
2. International Energy Agency (IEA)          :  Developing global energy policies
3. International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA): Focus on sustainable development goals
4.  Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW):  Water resource management research


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The IEA focuses on global energy policies and the GCEW conducts research on water resource management. The ISA's mandate is broader than just Africa, encompassing countries beyond that region. While IRENA is involved in sustainable development, its primary focus is on renewable energy, not solely SDGs. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their specific roles in environmental governance.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations and their nuanced functions.  The inclusion of both energy-focused and water-focused organizations requires a broader understanding of global environmental initiatives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Report/Index                Key Characteristic/Publisher
1. SDG India Index 2023-24                    :   Measures progress on 17 SDGs
2. EnviStats India 2024                      :   Published by the Ministry of Jal Shakti
3. Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI)    :   Evaluates ecological development using four pillars (Air, Soil, Tree, and Water)
4.  System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA):  Describes interactions between economy and environment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The SDG India Index 2023-24 does measure progress on 113 indicators aligned with the SDGs. The GEPI uses four pillars (Air, Soil, Tree, and Water) to evaluate ecological development. SEEA indeed describes the interactions between the economy and the environment. However, EnviStats India 2024 is published by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not the Ministry of Jal Shakti. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of environmental indices and reporting frameworks.  The distractors require precise knowledge to distinguish between the publishers and characteristics of different reports.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall details related to different environmental accounting methods.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Conservation Project/Initiative            Implementing/Partner Agency
1. Bustard Recovery Project                   :   Bombay Natural History Society
2. Crocodile Conservation Project            :   National Mission for Clean Ganga
3. Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH): Wildlife Institute of India
4.  Western Ghats Eco-sensitive Area         :   National Green Tribunal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Bombay Natural History Society is a partner in the Bustard Recovery Project, and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change implements the IDWH scheme.  The Crocodile Conservation Project isn't implemented by the NMCG. The Western Ghats Eco-sensitive Area designation is primarily handled by the central government, not the NGT.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific conservation projects and the agencies involved. The distractors test their ability to recall accurate details about the implementing and partner organizations.  The question requires a thorough understanding of wildlife conservation initiatives in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Function/Act
1. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)       :   Implementation of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
2. National Green Tribunal (NGT)                :   Resolution of environmental disputes
3. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)           :   Management of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
4. Committee for Air Quality Management      :   Regulation of water resources across India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it's also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a specialized body designed to handle environmental disputes quickly and efficiently.  Its primary function is dispute resolution, making pair 2 correct.  The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) focuses on the assessment, development, and management of groundwater resources in India, not the implementation of the Water Act of 1974, which is the CPCB's responsibility. This makes pair 3 incorrect.  There is no mention of a Committee for Air Quality Management regulating water resources.  Thus, pair 4 is incorrect. Option (a) accurately reflects the correct pairings. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Body                     Characteristic
1. Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) :   Launched by the Government of India
2. Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund      :   Funds projects to manage hazardous waste
3.  SDG India Index 2023-24                         :   Measures progress on 17 Sustainable Development Goals
4.  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)     :   Focuses solely on climate adaptation strategies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund specifically aims to support low- and middle-income countries in managing chemicals and waste, aligning with international standards. This makes pair 2 correct. The SDG India Index 2023-24 indeed measures and tracks the progress of States and Union Territories on various indicators aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), though it focuses on a subset of 113 indicators rather than all 17 goals.  This makes pair 3 largely correct, despite the minor inaccuracy.  The Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) was launched by the Government of the Netherlands, not India, making pair 1 incorrect. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) encompass both climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, not solely adaptation, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, leading to option (c) as the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Report/Atlas                      Issuing Body

2. CPCB Report on Environmental Funds          :   National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)
3.  Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP) report:   United Nations University and International Telecommunication Union
4. The Economics of Water report                 :   Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP) is indeed a collaboration between the United Nations University and the International Telecommunication Union, making pair 3 correct. The Economics of Water report was issued by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW), making pair 4 correct.  The Annual Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Atlas of India is released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not the Ministry of Jal Shakti, making pair 1 incorrect. The CPCB report on unutilized environmental funds was submitted to the NGT, not issued by the NRSC, making pair 2 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched, resulting in option (c) being the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Waste Management Related Term/Concept        Description
1. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)       :   A policy instrument for protection of environment
2. Environmental Compensation (EC)             :   Obligation of producers to manage end-of-life products
3. Basel Convention                          :   Focuses solely on e-waste management
4. R2 Code of Practices                        :   Promotes environmentally responsible practices in electronics recycling


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) mandates producers to take responsibility for the end-of-life management of their products, making pair 1 correct. Environmental Compensation (EC) is levied on entities for non-compliance with waste management rules,  making pair 2 correct. The Basel Convention is a broader agreement on the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, not solely focused on e-waste, making pair 3 incorrect. The R2 Code of Practices promotes environmentally responsible practices in the electronics recycling industry, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, leading to option (c) as the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Environmental Agreement/Initiative   Focus Area
1. UNFCCC COP29                                  :   Finalized rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
2.  International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)   :   Sustainable water resource management
3.  United Nations Water Convention               :   Equitable use of transboundary waters
4.  Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW):   Management of chemicals and waste


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

UNFCCC COP29 did finalize the rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which deals with international carbon markets, making pair 1 correct. The United Nations Water Convention focuses on the equitable and sustainable management of transboundary watercourses and international lakes, making pair 3 correct.  The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) primarily focuses on rice research and development, not sustainable water resource management in a broad sense, though water management is relevant to rice cultivation, making pair 2 incorrect. The Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) focuses on the economics of water, not the management of chemicals and waste, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched, resulting in option (a) as the correct answer.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Key Function/Characteristic
1. CPCB                                        :   Formed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
2. CGWB                                       :   Falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti
3. Committee for Air Quality Management     :   Responsible for implementing the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
4. NGT                                         :   Handles cases pertaining to environmental issues and is a statutory body

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is indeed a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, but it also holds significant powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct but the emphasis on the Air Act distracts the examinee. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) operates under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, making statement 2 correct. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is accurately described as a statutory body dealing with environmental cases, hence statement 4 is correct. Option (c) is incorrect because the Committee for Air Quality Management is not mentioned in the provided text, making it a distractor.  Option (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to include the correct pairings. The question's difficulty stems from the subtle inaccuracies and the inclusion of a plausible, yet ultimately incorrect, distractor in option (3).  Understanding the exact legal basis and functions of these organizations is crucial for a correct answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Convention                             Key Feature/Characteristic
1. UN Water Convention                           :   India is a signatory party
2. Namami Gange Program                         :   Focuses solely on cleaning the Ganga River
3. National Water Awards                          :   Presented annually by the President of India
4. Global Commission on the Economics of Water :   Launched by the Government of China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The National Water Awards are accurately described as being presented by the President of India, making statement 3 correct.  However, statement 1 is incorrect because the provided text explicitly states that India is *not* a party to the UN Water Convention. Statement 2 is incorrect because while Namami Gange primarily focuses on the Ganga, it also includes its tributaries, making the statement an oversimplification.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Global Commission on the Economics of Water was launched by the Government of the Netherlands, not China, serving as a significant distractor. The question's difficulty arises from the need to recall precise details about these initiatives and the inclusion of several plausible but incorrect options.  A superficial understanding of these environmental initiatives would lead to incorrect answers.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Program              Funding Source/Governing Body
1.  MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative)                 :   World Wildlife Fund (WWF) India
2.  Global Mangrove Alliance                    :   United Nations High Level Climate Champions
3.  Green Credit Program                         :   Ministry of Jal Shakti
4.  GFC Fund                                   :   Global Environment Facility

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

MISHTI is correctly linked to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), making it a distractor in option 1; however, WWF India is involved in a related campaign (Magical Mangroves), which may confuse candidates. The Global Mangrove Alliance is correctly paired with the United Nations High Level Climate Champions.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the Green Credit Program falls under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), not the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the GFC Fund complements existing mechanisms but is not directly funded by the Global Environment Facility.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations and initiatives within the environmental sector.  The close relationship between some of the organizations and initiatives makes the question challenging.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980                :   Establishes the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC)
2.  Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022   :   Introduces the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) Scheme
3.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986       :   Establishes the Green Credit Program
4.  Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 :   Establishes the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, correctly establishes the FAC.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, correctly establishes the Green Credit Program.  However, statement 2 is incorrect because while the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022, introduces changes to carbon markets, it does not establish the PAT scheme; the PAT scheme pre-dates this act and is being transitioned into the new framework.  Statement 4 is incorrect because the CGWB is not established under the Water Act; while related, its establishment is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.  The question tests detailed knowledge of environmental legislation and policy in India.  The inclusion of partially correct statements (2 and 4) creates a challenging distractor effect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ramsar Site Characteristic/Convention Feature      Example
1.  Maximum number of Ramsar sites in India         :   Uttar Pradesh
2.  Wetland meeting at least one of nine criteria     :   Loktak Lake
3.  Included in the Montreux Record                   :   Keoladeo National Park
4.  Ramsar Convention entry into force date           :   1982

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Loktak Lake is correctly identified as a wetland meeting at least one of the nine Ramsar criteria. Keoladeo National Park is correctly identified as a Ramsar site included in the Montreux Record. However, Tamil Nadu has the maximum number of Ramsar sites, not Uttar Pradesh, making statement 1 incorrect. The Ramsar Convention came into force in 1975, not 1982 (India joined in 1982), making statement 4 incorrect.  The question tests the detailed knowledge of Ramsar sites and the convention.  The use of close but incorrect figures and locations significantly increases the difficulty level.


**1. With reference to Glacial Lakes and GLOFs, consider the following pairs:**

    Lake/River                                     Event/Feature
1. Chorabari Lake, Uttarakhand                 :   2023 GLOF event
2. Teesta River, Sikkim                         :   GLOF impacting Teesta III Dam
3. Mandakini River, Uttarakhand                :   2013 GLOF event
4. South Lhonak Lake, Sikkim                   :   2013 GLOF event
5. Gilkey Glacier, Alaska                       :   Example of glacial surging

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 2013 Uttarakhand floods were significantly caused by a GLOF in the Chorabari Lake, making pair 3 correct.  The 2023 GLOF at South Lhonak, Sikkim, resulted in damage to the Teesta III Dam, thereby making pair 2 correct.  Pair 5 is also correct as Gilkey Glacier in Alaska serves as a documented example of glacial surging, a phenomenon contributing to GLOFs.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the Chorabari Lake GLOF occurred in 2013, not 2023. Pair 4 is incorrect because the South Lhonak GLOF occurred in 2023, not 2013.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Understanding the temporal aspect of GLOF events and the different contributing factors (like glacial surging) is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation in the Himalayan region.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific GLOF events and their associated geographical locations, demanding both factual recall and the ability to discern correct pairings from a set of plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to the Ramsar Convention and Indian Wetlands, consider the following pairs:**

    Wetland                                       Designation/Feature
1. Nagi and Nakti bird sanctuaries, Bihar      :   Brackish water wetland
2. Nanjarayan Bird Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu       :   Located on Coromandel Coast
3. Kazhuveli Bird Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu        :   Man-made reservoir
4. Tawa Reservoir, Madhya Pradesh             :   Located inside Satpura Tiger Reserve
5. Loktak Lake, Manipur                         :   Included in Montreux Record

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 4 is correct as the Tawa Reservoir is situated within the Satpura Tiger Reserve. Pair 5 is correct because Loktak Lake is indeed listed on the Montreux Record due to ecological changes.  Pair 1 is incorrect; Nagi and Nakti are man-made reservoirs, not brackish wetlands.  Pair 2 is incorrect; Kazhuveli is on the Coromandel Coast, not Nanjarayan. Pair 3 is incorrect; Kazhuveli is a brackish lake, not a man-made reservoir. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific Indian wetlands, their locations, and their status under the Ramsar Convention, demanding accurate factual recall.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, requiring careful consideration of the details for each wetland.


**3. With reference to organizations involved in water resource management in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                 Mandate/Function
1. Central Water Commission (CWC)             :   Deals primarily with groundwater resources
2. Central Groundwater Board (CGWB)          :   Manages surface water resources
3. National Mission for Clean Ganga (Namami Gange):  Develops e-flow monitoring systems
4. Ministry of Jal Shakti                       :   Oversees National Water Awards
5. International Hydrographic Organization (IHO):  Joint project with IOC on GEBCO

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only

2. Bactrian camel                   :   Kutch (Gujarat)
3. Kharai camel                     :   Hot deserts (Rajasthan, Gujarat)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 accurately reflects the geographical distribution of camel species within India.  Dromedary camels (single-humped) are indeed found in the hot deserts of Rajasthan and Gujarat, known for their ability to thrive in arid conditions.  Bactrian camels (double-humped) are native to Central Asia and are found in Ladakh's Nubra Valley, a high-altitude cold desert region. Kharai camels, a unique breed known for their ability to swim in the sea to graze on mangroves, are specifically found in the Kutch region of Gujarat.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly interchange the habitats of Dromedary and Bactrian camels.  The question tests factual recall regarding the distribution of camel species in India, a detail relevant to understanding India's biodiversity and the unique adaptations of its fauna to diverse climatic regions.  Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched.

2. Number of NDCs containing quantified afforestation/reforestation targets : 8
3. Focus of UN-REDD Programme            : Advancing the Paris Agreement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The UN-REDD report's key finding highlights that only 8 out of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have included quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).  Furthermore, 11 of the NDCs examined included quantified targets related to afforestation and reforestation.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Marine Heatwaves (MHWs) are indeed periods where seawater temperatures surpass a seasonal threshold for a minimum of five consecutive days.  Oil spills, a form of pollution, are the release of liquid petroleum hydrocarbons into the environment.  Lahars and Kallakkadal are incorrectly paired with their descriptions. Lahars are volcanic mudflows, while Kallakkadal is a specific type of coastal flooding in Kerala and Tamil Nadu caused by swell waves.  GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods) are also correctly defined as floods caused by the sudden release of water from a glacial lake.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the definitions of the phenomena.


**2. With reference to environmental phenomena, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Definition

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA), also known as Dacthal, is a herbicide.  Studies have shown a correlation between fetal exposure to DCPA and impaired motor skills in children later in life, along with other developmental issues like low birth weight and reduced IQ. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor primarily found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. While BPA exposure is linked to several health problems, cardiovascular disease is not a primary or consistently established effect.  The more commonly cited effects include impacts on the brain, prostate gland, and reproductive system, particularly in fetuses, infants, and children. Thus, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent organic pollutants known for their persistence in the environment and human bodies.  Research indicates a link between PFAS exposure and various health problems, including developmental issues.  Low birth weight in fetuses exposed to PFAS has been documented in several studies.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger, launched in 1973, is a flagship conservation program focused on protecting the Indian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris).  Option 1 is incorrect as it wrongly assigns Indian lions as the focus. Project Lion is a separate initiative. Project Elephant, initiated in 1992, aims to protect the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and its habitat.  Project Dolphin, also initiated in 2010, focuses on the conservation of the Gangetic river dolphin (Platanista gangetica). Option 4 is incorrect because the Great Indian Bustard Recovery Project, while aiming to protect the Great Indian Bustard, includes other bustard species; the Bengal Florican is a separate species under other conservation programs.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect due to the mismatched species in pairs 1 and 4.  Understanding the specific focus of each project is crucial for correct matching.


**2. With reference to IUCN Red List Categories, consider the following pairs:**

2. Copiapoa cacti                          : Endangered
3. Gran Canaria giant lizard               : Least Concern
4. Bornean Elephant                       : Near Threatened


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that the La Gomera giant lizard was updated to Endangered (from Critically Endangered), making option 1 incorrect in its assertion of Critically Endangered status.  The text also mentions that 82% of Copiapoa cacti species are at risk of extinction, indicating a high endangerment level, aligning with the Endangered classification. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The text indicates the Gran Canaria giant lizard changed from Least Concern to Critically Endangered, making option 3 incorrect.  The Bornean elephant's status is given as Endangered in the text, not Near Threatened. Hence, only pair 2 is partially correct, but within the given options, (b) is the closest to the truth, although it doesn't fully capture the nuanced changes. Option (d) is incorrect because, while there are mismatches, one pair is partially correct.  This question highlights the importance of precise information recall from conservation updates.


**3. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that Estonia topped the EPI 2024 list, making pair 3 incorrect.  India's rank is given as 176, not 180, making pair 2 incorrect.  The text doesn't provide a specific rank for China, only mentioning that India surpassed China as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2 in 2022, implying a lower rank for China compared to Estonia.  Pair 4 is inherently incorrect because it requires speculation on a country's rank where the only mentioned country with a specific rank is India.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting numerical data and avoiding assumptions.


**4.  With reference to the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH), consider the following pairs:**

    IDWH Component                         Specific Example Mentioned in the Text
1. Support to protected areas              : Project Lion
2. Protection of wildlife outside PAs     : Species Recovery Program
3. Recovery programs for endangered species: Project Tiger
4. Sub-scheme under IDWH                 : People's Biodiversity Register


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Project Lion is explicitly mentioned as a sub-scheme under IDWH, falling under the component of support to protected areas.  The Species Recovery Program, with its focus on saving critically endangered species and habitats, directly relates to the protection of wildlife outside protected areas. Project Tiger is also a sub-scheme under IDWH, but it's primarily focused on tiger conservation within protected areas (although it indirectly helps protect wildlife outside through habitat connectivity). The People's Biodiversity Register is not a sub-scheme under IDWH; it's a separate initiative under the Biological Diversity Act. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect due to the misclassification of Project Tiger and the People's Biodiversity Register.  This question tests the understanding of the hierarchical structure of wildlife conservation initiatives.


**5. With reference to the different types of Speciation, consider the following pairs:**

    Speciation Type                         Example Mentioned in Text
1. Allopatric Speciation                   : Asiatic Lions & Bengal Tigers
2. Peripatric Speciation                   : Not explicitly given in the text
3. Parapatric Speciation                    : Not explicitly given in the text
4. Sympatric Speciation                    : Asiatic Lions & Bengal Tigers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly uses Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers as an example of sympatric speciation, where new species are formed within the range of the ancestral population, even without geographical barriers.  The text does not provide examples for allopatric, peripatric, or parapatric speciation. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs based on the information provided. This question tests the ability to identify and apply specific examples of biological concepts.

2. Least Concern                              :  South India
3. Vulnerable                                 :  West India
4. Critically Endangered                      : Mangroves in Lakshadweep archipelago and on coast of Tamil Nadu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems indicated that the mangrove ecosystems of South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Northwest Atlantic were identified as critically endangered.  West India mangroves were classified as vulnerable.  The State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report further supports this, indicating that mangroves in Lakshadweep archipelago and on the coast of Tamil Nadu are critically endangered.  The Andaman and Bay of Bengal mangroves are categorized as Least Concern, contradicting option 1.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly match the mangrove status with their locations.  Understanding the nuances of mangrove conservation status across different regions in India and globally is crucial for effective environmental management and policy-making.  The question tests the ability to recall specific details and differentiate between different sources of information regarding mangrove conservation status.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  The text specifies that MISHTI is implemented under the MOEF&CC, making option 1 incorrect. SAIME and the National Coastal Mission Programme are also under MOEF&CC.  The Magical Mangroves campaign is a WWF India initiative, making option 3 incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the different organizations involved in India's mangrove conservation efforts. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific government and non-governmental initiatives involved in mangrove conservation in India.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to accurately associate initiatives with their implementing bodies.

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Gape limitation accurately describes the ecological concept of prey size limitations based on predator mouth size. Megafauna correctly defines animals exceeding a certain weight threshold and their dietary classifications. Stromatolites are indeed microbial communities that have played a significant role in Earth's atmospheric history.  Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a valid and increasingly used method for biodiversity assessment. Finally, bioluminescence accurately describes the light-emitting property of organisms and its underlying biochemical mechanism.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided definitions or characteristics.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.

   Ecological Concept                       Description
1. Plankton Crash                           :   Caused by a lack of nutrients or CO2 in the early production cycle, or a sudden change in water quality later in the cycle.
2. Red Tides                                :   Caused by pigments from plankton sticking to rocks and the seafloor, forming a biofilm-like layer.
3. Speciation                               :   A lineage-splitting event producing two or more separate species, generating biodiversity.  Occurs through allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, or sympatric modes.
4.  Microplastics                            :   Small plastic pieces (<5 mm) categorized as primary (designed tiny particles) or secondary (breakdown of larger plastics).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The description of plankton crashes accurately reflects the causes of these events within the plankton life cycle. Red tides are correctly linked to the accumulation of pigments from plankton.  The definition of speciation encompasses the key aspects of lineage splitting and the various modes through which it occurs. The description of microplastics differentiates accurately between primary and secondary sources.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct choice.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and leave out correctly matched pairs.

4. Species Recovery Programme (under IDWH) :  Saving Critically Endangered Species

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger, launched in 1973, focuses primarily on tiger conservation, not Asiatic lions.  Asiatic lions are a separate conservation concern, though they might benefit indirectly from habitat protection efforts. Project Elephant, initiated in 1992, aims to protect the elephant population and their habitat.  Project Dolphin is specifically designed for the conservation of Gangetic River dolphins. The Species Recovery Programme, a component of the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH), is explicitly focused on saving critically endangered species and their habitats.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect because Project Tiger's primary focus is not Asiatic lions.

1. International Rhino Foundation (IRF)       :  Released the State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report
2. Global Mangrove Alliance                  :  Released the State of the Rhino 2024 report
3. Forest Survey of India (FSI)              :  Published India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Rhino Foundation (IRF) released the State of the Rhino 2024 report, not the State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report. The Global Mangrove Alliance published the State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report, not the State of the Rhino 2024 report. The Forest Survey of India (FSI) accurately published the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept in Ecology                           Description
1. Gape Limitation                             : Refers to the physical constraint on the size of prey a predator can consume
2. Speciation                                  :  The property of a living organism to emit light
3. Bioluminescence                             : A lineage-splitting event that produces two or more separate species


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gape limitation accurately describes the physical constraint on prey size based on a predator's mouth size. Speciation is the process of lineage splitting creating new species, not the emission of light. Bioluminescence is the ability of organisms to produce and emit light.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 incorrectly attributes the definition of speciation to bioluminescence.


**1. With reference to global climate finance mechanisms under the UNFCCC, consider the following pairs:**

2. High-Level Working Group (HLWG) Report: Recommended color-coding industries and extending Entry 20 of the Concurrent List for regulation
3.  Brahmagiri Hills case                    :  National Green Tribunal (NGT) intervention regarding ESZ declaration timeline
4. Geographical Extent                      : Covers six states, with approximately 60% located in Karnataka.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of the Western Ghats. The Western Ghats ESZ is indeed categorized into zones reflecting varying degrees of ecological sensitivity. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG) report, headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, proposed key recommendations, including industry color-coding and extending the scope of Entry 20 of the Concurrent List to improve environmental regulation within the Western Ghats region.  The Brahmagiri Hills case highlights the NGT's involvement in ensuring timely declaration of the Western Ghats as an eco-sensitive zone. Finally, the geographical extent of the Western Ghats correctly encompasses six states, with a significant portion situated in Karnataka.  The information presented in each pair is factual and accurate.


**3. With reference to the initiatives launched at COP29, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Key Aim

There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Project                     Focus Area
1. Project Tiger                       :  Conservation of Asiatic Lions
2. Project Elephant                    :  Protection of Elephants
3. Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) : Support to Community Reserves only
4. MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative)       :  Mangrove Ecosystem Restoration


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger, launched in 1973, is specifically focused on the conservation of tigers in India.  Option 1 is incorrect because Project Tiger does not deal with Asiatic lions; that is the purview of another conservation program. Project Elephant, initiated in 1992, aims to protect elephants and their habitats. Option 2 is correctly matched. The Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) is a broader scheme encompassing support for various protected areas, including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves. Option 3 is incorrect because IDWH's scope is much wider than just community reserves. MISHTI, the Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes, is dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development of mangrove ecosystems. Option 4 is correctly matched. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of PBR                       Description
1. Statutory Recognition                :  National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)
2. Information documented             :  Local medicinal plant uses only
3. Purpose                             :  Safeguarding bioresources and associated knowledge
4. Relevance                           :  Supports claims of national ownership of biodiversity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PBR finds its statutory backing in the Biological Diversity Act of 2002, with Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) playing a crucial role in its creation in consultation with local communities.  Option 1 is incorrect as it mentions NBA instead of the Biological Diversity Act.  PBRs document a wide range of information related to local bioresources, including their medicinal, cultural, and other uses, not limited to medicinal plants only. Option 2 is incorrect.  The core purpose of a PBR is to document and safeguard both bioresources and the associated traditional knowledge of local communities. Option 3 is correctly matched.  While PBRs support local ownership claims, they do not necessarily focus on national-level ownership.  Option 4 is incorrect. Thus, only options 3 and, with slight modification, 1 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Index/Report         Key Feature
1. Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024 : Ranks countries on climate change performance only
2. Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024    : Uses 58 performance indicators
3. IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems : Assessed 36 regions across 44 countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The EPI 2024 assesses countries across multiple areas, including climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. Option 1 is incorrect as it is not limited to climate change performance. The NCI 2024 uses four markers (Land management, Threats to biodiversity, Capacity and governance, and Future trends), not 58 indicators. This number of indicators is a feature of EPI. Option 2 is incorrect.  The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems did assess 36 regions across 44 countries. Option 3 is correctly matched. Therefore, only option 3 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India's mangrove conservation, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Characteristic

   Environmental Concern/Issue          Related Government/International Initiative
1.  Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) risks:   Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW)
2.  Safe and sustainable chemical waste management:   Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund
3.  Flood monitoring and forecasting        :   Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Framework on Chemicals (GFC) Fund directly addresses the safe and sustainable management of chemicals and waste, making pair 2 correct. The Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative focuses on strengthening early warning systems for hazardous weather, water, or climate events, including floods, thereby making pair 3 correct.  However, the Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW) deals with water resource management and not specifically with the risks associated with Underground Coal Gasification (UCG). UCG risks are primarily related to issues like induced subsidence, groundwater contamination, and unsteady-state processes, which are not the focus of GCEW. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude the correctly matched pairs 2 and 3.


**3. With reference to sustainable energy initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective

   Initiative/Framework                     Specific Goal/Focus
1. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction:  Managing cross-border GLOF risks
2. Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative:  Protecting everyone from hazardous weather events by 2027
3. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF):   Providing financial assistance to states beyond their coping capacity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The Sendai Framework does indeed encourage international cooperation to manage cross-border risks, including those related to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), making pair 1 correct.  The EW4All initiative aims to achieve global coverage of early warning systems for various hazards by 2027, aligning with pair 2.  The NDRF, while involved in disaster response, primarily focuses on response and relief efforts, and the allocation of funds for recovery and reconstruction, and preparedness and capacity building, including additional funds where expenditure exceeds a state's capacity. Thus, pair 3 is also correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either omit correctly matched pairs or include an incorrectly matched pair.  The NDRF's role in financial assistance is a part of a broader disaster response strategy, not its sole focus.
