3.  Amrita Devi led the movement against the then King of Jodhpur's order to fell trees.
4.  The movement primarily involved male activists from the region.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the Chipko Movement.  The movement's origins are indeed linked to the resistance against deforestation in Reni village, Uttarakhand, and its historical roots are connected to a similar incident involving Amrita Devi of the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan in the 18th century.  Amrita Devi's act of defiance against the king's order to cut down trees is a pivotal event in the movement's history. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Chipko movement is renowned for the significant and active participation of women, who played a crucial role in its success. Leaders like Sunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt played important roles, but the movement's strength lay in the collective mobilization of village women, showcasing the philosophy of eco-feminism.


**2. Consider the following environmental movements:**

1.  Silent Valley Movement
2.  Appiko Movement
3.  Narmada Bachao Andolan
4.  Chilika Bachao Andolan

Which of the above movements primarily focused on protecting forest resources?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Silent Valley Movement and the Appiko Movement directly addressed forest conservation concerns. The Silent Valley Movement aimed to prevent the construction of a hydroelectric dam that would have submerged a significant portion of the Silent Valley rainforest in Kerala.  The Appiko Movement, inspired by the Chipko Movement, similarly focused on protecting forests in the Western Ghats region of Karnataka.  While the Narmada Bachao Andolan and Chilika Bachao Andolan involved environmental concerns, their primary focus wasn't solely on forests. The Narmada Bachao Andolan primarily protested the construction of large dams on the Narmada River, affecting not only forests but also displacement of communities and river ecosystems.  Chilika Bachao Andolan focused on the ecological restoration of the Chilika Lake, which involved various aspects of the lake's ecosystem, not solely forest conservation.


**3. Consider the following statements about the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA):**

1.  It's a globally agreed-upon framework for compiling environmental and economic accounts.
2.  It exclusively focuses on measuring the economic value of environmental assets.
3.  SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) measures ecosystems and their services to human activity.
4.  SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) only measures the extraction of natural resources by the economy.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. SEEA is indeed an internationally recognized framework for integrating environmental and economic data.  SEEA-EA specifically focuses on measuring the value of ecosystem services. SEEA-CF measures the use of environmental assets by the economy, including the extraction of resources. However, statement 2 is incorrect. SEEA doesn't *exclusively* focus on the economic value of assets; it also considers broader environmental factors and their interactions with economic activities.  It provides a holistic view of the relationship between the economy and the environment, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Lesser Florican ( *Sypheotides indicus*):**

1. It belongs to the bustard family (Otididae).
2.  It's the largest bird in the bustard family.
3.  Its habitat includes Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.
4.  Pesticide use and grassland mismanagement are significant threats.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Lesser Florican is indeed a member of the Otididae family. Its habitat spans across Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra, along with other states mentioned in the text.  Pesticide use in breeding grounds and mismanagement of agro-grasslands are major threats to its survival. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The Lesser Florican is explicitly described as the *smallest* bird of the bustard family, not the largest.


**5. Consider the following organizations related to environmental protection in India:**

1.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
2.  National Green Tribunal (NGT)
3.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)
4.  National Mission for Clean Ganga (Namami Gange)

Which of the above are primarily involved in monitoring and regulating aspects of water resources management?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CPCB, CGWB, and Namami Gange are directly involved in water resources management. The CPCB monitors water pollution and enforces related legislation. The CGWB focuses on groundwater management and regulation.  Namami Gange is a specific mission dedicated to cleaning the Ganga River and its tributaries. The NGT, while dealing with environmental cases, is a judicial body and not primarily a regulatory or monitoring organization for water resources in the same way as the others.  It adjudicates environmental disputes, which may include water-related issues, but its primary function is judicial, not executive or regulatory.


**6. Consider the following initiatives related to environmental conservation:**

1.  Project Tiger
2.  Project Elephant
3.  People's Biodiversity Register (PBR)
4.  Environmental Performance Index (EPI)

Which of the above are specifically designed to protect and conserve biodiversity in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger and Project Elephant are focused on protecting specific endangered species and their habitats within India. The People's Biodiversity Register (PBR) aims to document and safeguard local biodiversity and associated traditional knowledge. The EPI, however, is a global ranking of countries' environmental performance, not a specific conservation initiative within India. While the EPI indirectly reflects on the success of conservation efforts, it's not a direct conservation program like the others.  Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 directly address biodiversity conservation within India.


**7. Consider the following reports related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

1.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2024 (UN DESA)
2.  SDG India Index 2023-24 (NITI Aayog)
3.  EnviStats India 2024 (MoSPI)
4.  United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD) report

Which of the above reports specifically focus on tracking India’s progress towards achieving SDGs?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index 2023-24, released by NITI Aayog, is explicitly designed to measure and track India's progress on the SDGs.  While the UN DESA report provides a broader global perspective, the EnviStats India report focuses on environmental statistics, and the UN-REDD report concentrates on deforestation, all are relevant to SDGs but not directly focused on tracking India’s progress.  Therefore, only the NITI Aayog report directly addresses India's SDG progress.


**8. Consider the following concerning the Western Ghats:**

1.  It includes the Palghat Gap and Thal Ghat.
2.  Its elevation increases from south to north.
3.  It's one of the world's eight biodiversity hotspots.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Western Ghats indeed include the Palghat Gap and Thal Ghat passes. It is recognized as one of the world's eight biodiversity hotspots and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2012. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The elevation of the Western Ghats *increases from north to south*, not the other way around, with Anamudi being its highest peak in the south.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because GEPI evaluates ecological development considering both natural processes *and* human interventions. Statement 2 is correct; Uttarakhand was the first Indian state to launch GEPI. Statement 3 is incorrect as GEPI considers air, water, soil, and forests. Statement 4 is correct; the GEPI formula explicitly includes a forest index.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding Greenwashing:**

1.  Greenwashing is the practice of making unsubstantiated environmental claims to enhance a company's image.
2.  The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has issued guidelines to prevent greenwashing.
3.  These guidelines are applicable only to manufacturers and not to advertising agencies.
4.  The guidelines mandate the use of third-party certifications for all environmental claims.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines greenwashing. Statement 2 is correct; the CCPA has indeed issued guidelines. Statement 3 is incorrect; the guidelines apply to manufacturers, service providers, product sellers, advertisers, and advertising agencies. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the guidelines strongly encourage third-party certifications, they don't mandate it for *all* claims.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following about the Green Credit Programme (GCP):**

1.  The GCP is aligned with the "LiFE" initiative.
2.  The GCP is implemented solely by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The LULC Atlas is released by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC). Statement 2 is incorrect: The Atlas shows an *expansion* of Kharif and Rabi cropland. Statement 3 is correct:  The Atlas does indicate an increase in double/triple cropping areas. Statement 4 is correct:  The Atlas shows an overall increase in built-up land. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**9. Consider the following initiatives related to sustainable development:**

1.  Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index
2.  Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) Programme
3.  Green School Qualification System (GSQS)
4.  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR)

How many of the above are primarily focused on national-level initiatives in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The IEA's scope is broader than just renewable energy; it addresses all aspects of energy. Statement 2 is correct: IRRI-ISARC works on sustainable agriculture, relevant to environmental sustainability. Statement 3 is incorrect: UN DESA's work extends beyond disaster management to broader economic and social issues. Statement 4 is correct: The World Energy Council significantly influences global energy policy. Therefore, only two statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on environmental topics.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Paris Agreement (Article 6) and the Kyoto Protocol's carbon trading mechanisms:**

1.  Both agreements encompass a similar scope of participation, including all countries.
2.  The Kyoto Protocol focused primarily on project-based mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
3.  The Paris Agreement allows the use of older credits from inactive projects, similar to the Kyoto Protocol.
4.  Both agreements direct a share of proceeds from carbon trading to adaptation funds.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 4 are correct.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the Kyoto Protocol's reliance on project-based mechanisms like the CDM and Joint Implementation (JI). Statement 4 is also correct; both agreements allocate a portion of carbon trading proceeds to adaptation funds, although the percentages and mechanisms differ.

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Kyoto Protocol's scope was limited to developed countries (Annex I), while the Paris Agreement includes all countries.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Paris Agreement restricts the use of legacy credits (pre-2013), unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which allowed their use, contributing to oversupply concerns.  This difference reflects a key evolution in the approach to carbon markets.


**2. Consider the following aspects of climate finance:**

1. The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) aims to set a new climate finance goal post-2025.
2.  Article 9 of the Paris Agreement mandates developing countries to provide financial support to developed nations.
3.  The majority of climate finance is directed towards adaptation actions.
4.  A significant portion of existing climate investment is through debt or equity instruments.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The NCQG is indeed aimed at establishing a new climate finance goal after 2025, acknowledging the shortcomings of the previous $100 billion target.  The fact that a large share (~94%) of climate investment is channeled through debt or equity reflects the significant role of market-based mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect because Article 9 of the Paris Agreement mandates *developed* countries to provide financial support to *developing* countries, not the other way around.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the provided text indicates that 90% of climate finance goes to mitigation (reducing emissions), not adaptation (adjusting to climate change impacts).


**3. Consider the following organizations related to environmental protection in India:**

1. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change.
2.  The National Green Tribunal (NGT) is a statutory body formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.
3.  The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is primarily responsible for implementing legislation related to air pollution control.
4.  The Committee for Air Quality Management receives environmental compensation as per orders of the Supreme Court and the NGT.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. The CPCB does indeed operate under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the CPCB, not the NGT, is the statutory body formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the CGWB focuses on groundwater management, not primarily air pollution. Statement 4 is partially correct in that the CPCB receives compensation from various sources including orders from the Supreme Court and NGT, but framing it as a primary function of the Committee for Air Quality Management is inaccurate.


**4. Consider the following initiatives related to carbon markets and trading in India:**

1.  The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture promotes agroforestry and micro-irrigation to encourage farmers' participation in carbon trading.
2.  The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is an Indian policy to impose a carbon tax on imports.
3.  The Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme is gradually transitioning to the compliance mechanism under the Carbon Credits Trading Scheme (CCTS).
4.  The Green Credit Program (GCP) is primarily aimed at large energy-intensive industries to meet mandatory GHG emission intensity targets.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture does indeed aim to integrate sustainable agricultural practices into carbon trading.  The PAT scheme is also correctly identified as undergoing a transition to the CCTS compliance mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the CBAM is a European Union policy, not an Indian one.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the GCP is a voluntary program aiming to encourage broader participation beyond mandatory targets, unlike the CCTS compliance mechanism which specifically targets energy-intensive industries.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index:**

1. The SDGs India Index measures progress on indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s National Indicator Framework.
2.  The index assigns scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing achievement of 2030 targets.
3.  The NITI Aayog releases the SDG India Index.
4.  The index includes all States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The SDG India Index accurately reflects the described features: alignment with the national indicator framework, a 0-100 scoring system reflecting progress towards 2030 targets, its release by NITI Aayog, and its comprehensive coverage of all Indian states and UTs.  These are all key aspects of the index's design and purpose.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Question:** With reference to Statutory Bail in India, consider the following:
    1. It is a legal provision that allows an undertrial to be released from custody.
    2. If the court denies statutory bail, it must provide written reasons for the refusal.
    3. It does not apply to offences where the death penalty is a potential punishment.
    How many of the statements given above are correct?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Statutory bail is a provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) that mandates the release of an undertrial if the investigation is not completed within a specified time frame.  The court must provide reasons if bail is denied. However, statement 3 is incorrect. Statutory bail provisions do apply to offenses where the death penalty is a potential punishment; there are specific exceptions and conditions within the CrPC that govern such cases.  The availability of statutory bail depends on various factors, including the nature of the offense and the progress of the investigation, not solely on the potential for the death penalty.


2. **Question:** With reference to Exit polls, consider the following:
    1. It gives estimates about how people voted in an election.
    2. It began back in 1957 during the second Lok Sabha elections.
    Select the correct answer using the code given below:
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. Exit polls are surveys conducted immediately after voters leave polling stations, attempting to predict election outcomes based on voter preferences.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While exit polls are a relatively modern phenomenon, their widespread use in India didn't begin in 1957. The technology and sophistication of such polling evolved over time, and their widespread adoption and use came much later.


3. **Question:** Consider the following statements:
    1. The first coalition government in India was formed in 1977 with VP Singh as the Prime Minister.
    2. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the first Indian Prime Minister to complete his full term during the coalition government.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. The Janata Party government formed in 1977 was the first non-Congress coalition government, led by Morarji Desai, not V.P. Singh. V.P. Singh later led a National Front government, which was also a coalition, but not the first. Statement 2 is correct.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee's NDA government was the first coalition government to complete a full five-year term.


4. **Question:** Which one of the following is not correct regarding the "None of the Above" (NOTA) option?
    (a) It allows voters to formally express their rejection of all running candidates.
    (b) If NOTA gets the most number of votes in a constituency, the next candidate with the second-most number of votes is declared the winner.
    (c) It was first used in 2013 in the Kerala legislative assembly elections.
    (d) None of the above.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Options (a) and (c) are correct. NOTA provides voters a formal way to register their dissatisfaction with all candidates.  It was introduced in India in 2013. However, option (b) is incorrect. While NOTA votes are counted, if NOTA receives the most votes, the election is not automatically decided by the runner-up.  The election commission may decide to re-conduct the election under certain circumstances.


5. **Question:** With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:
    1. It is a constitutional body.
    2. It was established in 1993, in accordance with the Paris Principles.
    Select the correct answer using the code given below:
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body. Statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC's establishment was influenced by the Paris Principles, international guidelines for national human rights institutions.


6. **Question:** With reference to Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:
    1. It authorizes the Parliament to form a new state by separation of territory from any state or by uniting two or more states.
    2. The President is not required to refer the bill to the State Legislature under Article 3.
    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Both statements are correct. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution empowers Parliament to alter state boundaries, create new states, or abolish existing ones.  Crucially, the President isn't obligated to seek the views of the affected state legislatures before such changes are made; although it's a common practice.


7. **Question:** Consider the following statements:
    1. The Fourth Schedule of the Indian Constitution prescribes the "Forms of Oaths or Affirmations".
    2. The total number of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, in the Council of Ministers shall not exceed 15% of the total number of members of the House of the People.

Statement 4 is also false; the Paris Agreement *restricts* the use of legacy credits, not allowing them freely. Therefore, only two statements are accurate descriptions of the Paris Agreement's provisions.  The distractors focus on the nuances of the relationship between the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement's carbon market mechanisms, and the handling of legacy credits.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Keeling Curve and related concepts:**

1.  The Keeling Curve tracks the global average concentration of methane (CH4).
2.  A rising Keeling Curve indicates an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.
3.  The Keeling Curve data is primarily collected at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.
4.  Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs) directly influence the trajectory of the Keeling Curve.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Keeling Curve and its context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  The Keeling Curve indeed tracks CO2 levels, and a rising curve signifies an increase in atmospheric CO2.  The data is primarily collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Keeling Curve primarily focuses on CO2, not methane. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while CBAMs are related to climate policy and CO2 emissions, their impact on the Keeling Curve is indirect and not a direct influence on its trajectory.  Therefore, only two statements correctly describe the Keeling Curve and its context. The distractors here involve the specific gases tracked and the indirect nature of the impact of CBAMs on atmospheric CO2 concentrations.


**8. Consider the following about the National Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance:**

1.  The NCQG aims to triple climate finance to USD 300 billion annually by 2035.
2.  India proposed a goal of $1.3 trillion annually under the NCQG, with a significant portion coming from grants.
3.  The NCQG was proposed at COP21 to succeed the unmet $100 billion annual target set in 2009.
4.  The NCQG primarily focuses on adaptation finance, excluding mitigation efforts.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the NCQG and its context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The NCQG does aim to significantly increase climate finance, India did propose a substantial annual goal, and the NCQG was indeed proposed after the failure to meet the previous $100 billion target. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the NCQG encompasses both mitigation and adaptation finance, not solely adaptation. Therefore, three statements accurately reflect the NCQG and its context. The distractor is the focus area of the finance – whether it is for mitigation, adaptation, or both.


**9. Consider the following regarding India's actions at COP29:**

1.  India supported the use of third-party databases for measuring progress on adaptation.
2.  India opposed changes to the scope of the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP).
3.  India co-hosted a LeadIT meeting with Sweden to accelerate low-carbon industry transitions.
4.  India's participation in COP29 side events focused solely on mitigation strategies.


How many of the above statements accurately describe India's stance and actions at COP29?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. India did oppose changes to the MWP, and it co-hosted the LeadIT meeting with Sweden.  Statement 4 is incorrect; India's participation encompassed various aspects of climate action, not just mitigation.  Statement 1 is also incorrect; India opposed, not supported, the use of third-party databases. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect India's actions. The distractor is the specific stance of India on certain proposals and the breadth of its participation in COP29 events.



**10. Consider the following statements about the Global Environment Facility (GEF):**

1.  The GEF Council approved $736.4 million in funding.
2.  The GEF is a financial mechanism under the UNFCCC, primarily focused on adaptation finance.
3.  The GEF administers the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF).
4.  The GEF's primary focus is on supporting high-income countries in achieving their climate goals.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Global Environment Facility (GEF)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The GEF did approve significant funding, and it does administer the LDCF.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the GEF supports adaptation, its focus is broader, encompassing biodiversity, climate change, and other environmental areas.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the GEF primarily supports developing countries, not high-income nations.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the GEF. The distractor here is the specific focus areas of the GEF and the types of countries it supports.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Consider the following statements regarding the Nipah virus:**
    1. It is a zoonotic virus.
    2. It was first recognized in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia.
    3. Its symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting, and sore throat.
    Which of the above statements is/are correct?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  The Nipah virus is indeed a zoonotic virus, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans.  Its initial recognition occurred in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia, marking its first documented appearance. The listed symptoms—fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting, and sore throat—are all consistent with the common presentation of Nipah virus infection. Therefore, all three statements are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one true statement about the Nipah virus.


2. **Consider the following statements about sickle cell disease:**
    1. It is a non-hereditary disease.
    2. India has the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease in South Asia.
    Which of the statements given above is/are incorrect?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Sickle cell disease is a hereditary blood disorder, passed down through families via genetic inheritance.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. While India has a significant burden of sickle cell disease, the statement that it possesses the highest prevalence in South Asia requires further verification and might be inaccurate depending on the most recent epidemiological data. The other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly state that both statements are false or that neither is false. The focus should be on the definitively incorrect statement about the hereditary nature of the disease.


3. **PraVaHa, developed by ISRO, is used for:**
    (a) Predicting weather patterns
    (b) Aerodynamic and aerothermal analysis of aerospace vehicles
    (c) Monitoring satellite health

    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The CSIR was indeed established as an autonomous body, but not in 1942; its establishment predates that year.  Its headquarters are located in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 accurately reflects the CSIR's extensive network of national laboratories across India. Thus, only statement 2 is correct.


5. **The discovery of Reverse Transcriptase demonstrated that:**
    (a) Genetic information can only flow from DNA to RNA to protein.
    (b) RNA can give rise to DNA.
    (c) Proteins can be directly synthesized from DNA.
    (d) RNA is unnecessary for protein synthesis.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The discovery of reverse transcriptase revolutionized our understanding of molecular biology by showing that the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA → RNA → protein) is not absolute. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of DNA from an RNA template, a process known as reverse transcription. This discovery revealed that RNA can be used as a template for DNA synthesis, challenging the previously held belief that genetic information only flows in one direction. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either misrepresent the central dogma or omit the key finding of reverse transcriptase's activity.


6. **Which of the following accurately describes the "Phenome India" project?**

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Black holes lack a traditional surface in the way planets or stars do. Their defining characteristic is the event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing can escape. The center of a black hole is a singularity, a point of infinite density where our current understanding of physics, specifically general relativity, fails to describe the conditions.  Both statements accurately reflect key properties of black holes.


12. **Hydroxyurea, recently seen in the news, is used in:**
    (a) Food preservatives
    (b) Fruit ripening substances
    (c) Herbicides
    (d) Drug for treating sickle cell disease

**Correct Answer:** (d)

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Zero Shadow Day occurs when the sun is directly overhead, resulting in no shadows cast by vertical objects.  Statement 2 is incorrect; it happens twice a year, once around the summer solstice and once around the winter solstice, in regions between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Statement 3 is correct. The precise time of the Zero Shadow Day differs based on the geographical location due to variations in the Earth's axial tilt and the sun's position relative to the location.  Statement 4 is partially correct. While it's primarily an astronomical phenomenon, it's indirectly related to climate change as shifts in the Earth's climate could subtly influence the timing and duration of the Zero Shadow Day over longer time scales. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate, making (c) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly include statement 2 or 4, which contain inaccuracies.

2.  Its roots trace back to the 18th-century actions of the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan.
3.  It primarily involved male activists from the region.
4.  Sunderlal Bahuguna was a key leader of the movement.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Chipko movement's origins are indeed linked to Reni village in Uttarakhand and the earlier actions of the Bishnoi community. Sunderlal Bahuguna played a significant role in leading the movement. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chipko movement is renowned for the significant and active participation of women from the affected villages, making it a powerful example of eco-feminism.  This active role of women is a key element of the movement's historical significance and its broader impact on environmental activism.


**2. Consider the following statements related to the impacts of El Niño:**

1.  It causes strong monsoons and above-average rains in the Indian subcontinent.
2.  It leads to warmer winters in the Indian subcontinent.
3.  It has an opposite effect to La Niña in terms of monsoon patterns.
4.  It is a phenomenon primarily affecting the Pacific Ocean.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the impacts of El Niño on the Indian subcontinent?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

El Niño's impact on the Indian subcontinent is characterized by its contrasting effects compared to La Niña.  While La Niña typically strengthens monsoons, El Niño often leads to weaker monsoons and below-average rainfall.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2 is also incorrect as El Niño tends to lead to less extreme temperatures. Statement 3 is correct, as El Niño and La Niña have opposite effects on monsoon patterns.  Statement 4 is correct as El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The correct combination is thus 1 and 3.


**3. Consider the following local winds and their associated effects:**

1.  Loo: Causes a decline in insect-borne diseases.
2.  Aandhi/Kali Aandhi: Often brings relief from extreme heat.
3.  Mango showers:  Aid in the early ripening of mangoes.
4.  Elephanta winds: Mark the beginning of the southwest monsoon.

Which of the above statements correctly pairs a local wind with its primary effect?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only

5.  Changes in albedo.

How many of the above factors can significantly disturb the Earth's heat budget?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Earth's heat budget, also known as the Earth's energy balance, refers to the equilibrium between incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial radiation.  Any disruption to this balance can lead to climate change.  All the listed factors can significantly affect this balance:

1.  **The balance between incoming solar heat and outgoing terrestrial heat:** This is the fundamental basis of the heat budget.  Any imbalance, caused by changes in either incoming or outgoing radiation, directly affects the overall heat balance.

2.  **Reduction in ozone layer thickness:** The ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. A thinner ozone layer allows more UV radiation to reach the Earth's surface, which can indirectly influence the heat budget through increased atmospheric warming. Although not a direct effect on radiation balance, it's a significant indirect factor.

3.  **Melting of glaciers:** Glaciers have high albedo (reflectivity), reflecting a significant portion of incoming solar radiation back into space.  As glaciers melt, this reflectivity decreases, leading to increased absorption of solar radiation by the Earth's surface, thus warming the planet and disturbing the heat budget.

4.  **Increased volcanic activity:** Volcanic eruptions release large amounts of gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. These aerosols can reflect sunlight back into space, temporarily cooling the planet, while greenhouse gases can trap heat, warming the planet. Both effects disrupt the heat budget.

5.  **Changes in albedo:** Albedo refers to the reflectivity of the Earth's surface.  Changes in land use (e.g., deforestation), snow cover, and ice extent alter the Earth's albedo, affecting the amount of solar radiation absorbed and reflected, thereby directly impacting the heat budget.

Therefore, all five factors listed can significantly disturb the Earth's heat budget.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Several statements regarding GLOFs are inaccurate:

1. **GLOFs are exclusively caused by seismic activity:**  Incorrect. While seismic activity can trigger GLOFs by destabilizing moraine dams or causing ice calving,  GLOFs can also result from other factors like excessive precipitation, glacial surging, and the gradual weakening of ice or moraine dams due to melting.

2. **Moraine dam instability is a contributing factor to GLOFs:** Correct. Moraine dams, composed of unconsolidated material, are inherently unstable and prone to failure, leading to GLOFs.

3. **GLOFs pose no significant threat to downstream populations:** Incorrect. GLOFs can cause devastating downstream flooding, resulting in significant loss of life, property damage, and infrastructure destruction.

4. **The Himalayan region is particularly vulnerable to GLOFs:** Correct. The Himalayan region, with its numerous glacial lakes and dynamic geological processes, is highly susceptible to GLOFs.

5. **GLOFs are always predictable events:** Incorrect. While advancements in monitoring and forecasting are improving predictability, GLOFs are often sudden and unpredictable events, making them particularly dangerous.

Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 5 are incorrect, making the correct answer (c).

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The increasing frequency of cyclones on India's western coast is a complex phenomenon linked to several factors.  Let's analyze the given options:

1. **Increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs):** Correct. Warmer ocean waters provide the energy needed for cyclone formation and intensification. Higher SSTs in the Arabian Sea contribute directly to this increase.

2. **Unusual monsoon wind systems:** Correct. Changes in monsoon wind patterns can influence the formation and track of cyclones, potentially driving them towards the western coast.

3. **Moisture from the Arabian Sea:** Correct.  The Arabian Sea provides ample moisture, a crucial ingredient for cyclone development. Increased moisture content fuels stronger and more frequent cyclones.

4. **Soil moisture from land areas:** Correct.  Soil moisture from land areas can contribute to atmospheric instability, which can influence cyclone formation and intensity, although less directly than ocean temperatures and moisture.

5. **Decreased frequency of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal:** Incorrect. This statement contradicts the observed trend. While the ratio of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea remains higher, the frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is increasing, not decreasing.

Therefore, four of the listed factors (1, 2, 3, and 4) are considered potential reasons for the increasing frequency of cyclones on India's western coast.

4.  Funding for research into new wildlife management techniques.
5.  International collaboration on wildlife conservation.


How many of the above are core components or objectives of the IDWH scheme?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IDWH scheme focuses on supporting protected areas (including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, conservation reserves, and community reserves), protecting wildlife outside these designated areas, and implementing species recovery programs for critically endangered species and habitats.  The scheme does not explicitly include funding for research into new wildlife management techniques or international collaboration as core components, although these may be indirectly supported or facilitated. Therefore, only three of the listed options are core components of the IDWH scheme.


**4. Consider the following regarding People's Biodiversity Registers (PBRs):**

1.  They are mandated under the Biological Diversity Act of 2002.
2.  Their purpose is to document local biological resources and associated knowledge.
3.  They support claims of local ownership of biodiversity.
4.  They are primarily compiled by government agencies.
5.  Information on medicinal uses of plants is included.


How many of the above accurately reflect the characteristics and purpose of PBRs?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PBRs are indeed mandated under the Biological Diversity Act of 2002, with Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) playing a key role in their preparation in consultation with local communities.  Their core purpose is to document and safeguard local bioresources and associated traditional knowledge, which often includes information on medicinal uses and other applications of plants and animals.  PBRs do support claims of local ownership of biodiversity and traditional knowledge. While government agencies may be involved, the primary compilation is done by BMCs in consultation with local communities.  Therefore, four of the statements accurately reflect the characteristics and purpose of PBRs.


**5. Consider the following about the Environmental Performance Index (EPI):**

1.  It is published by Yale University.
2.  It ranks countries on environmental health.
3.  It uses a large number of performance indicators.
4.  It includes assessment of climate change performance.
5.  India consistently ranks among the top 20 countries.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the EPI?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The EPI is published by the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy, ranking countries based on various environmental performance indicators covering climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality.  It uses a considerable number of indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment. While India's ranking is not consistently among the top 20, statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the EPI.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Nature Conservation Index (NCI):**

1. It ranks countries based on their conservation efforts.
2. It considers biodiversity as a key metric.
3. The Goldman School of Sustainability publishes the index.
4. India’s ranking has consistently improved over time.
5. The index incorporates aspects of ecosystem services.


How many of the above accurately represent the NCI?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCI ranks countries based on their conservation performance.  Biodiversity is a crucial metric, and the Goldman School of Sustainability is involved in its publication. The index likely incorporates ecosystem services, though this may not be explicitly stated in every publication.  However, India's ranking has not consistently improved. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately describe the NCI.


**7.  Consider the following regarding the use of bioremediation in oil spill cleanup:**

1.  It involves the use of microorganisms to degrade oil.
2.  Genetically engineered microorganisms can be employed.
3.  Bioremediation is always the most effective method.
4.  Oilzapper is an example of a bioremediation product.
5.  Bioremediation is only applicable to marine oil spills.


How many of the above accurately describe the role of bioremediation in oil spill response?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bioremediation uses microorganisms to break down oil components. Genetically modified organisms can enhance this process.  However, bioremediation is not always the most effective method and may be used in conjunction with other techniques. Oilzapper is a commercially available product using bioremediation.  Bioremediation is applicable to various environments, not just marine ones.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding  Direct Air Capture and Storage (DAC+S) technology:**

1.  It captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere.
2.  It is a type of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technology.
3.  It is generally used at the point of emission.
4.  Captured CO2 can be permanently stored.
5.  Mammoth is the world's largest DAC+S plant.


How many of the above statements accurately describe DAC+S technology?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

DAC+S captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere, representing a CDR technology.  The captured CO2 can be permanently stored underground or used for other applications.  It differs from carbon capture at the point of emission. Mammoth is indeed one of the world's largest DAC+S plants.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements about  Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies:**

1.  Afforestation is a form of CDR.
2.  Enhanced weathering involves using minerals to absorb CO2.
3.  Ocean fertilization is a widely deployed CDR method.
4.  Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a CDR technology.
5.  CDR is not considered necessary to achieve net-zero emissions.


How many of the above accurately describe CDR technologies?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Afforestation (planting trees) and reforestation are ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in biomass. Enhanced weathering uses minerals to react with and absorb atmospheric CO2. BECCS combines biomass energy production with CO2 capture and storage. Ocean fertilization, while a proposed method, is not yet widely deployed due to concerns about ecological impacts.  The IPCC considers CDR necessary for achieving net-zero emissions.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the characteristics of fungi:**

1. Fungi have cell walls made of chitin.
2. They are primarily autotrophic organisms.
3. They play a significant role in decomposition.
4.  Mycorrhizae are beneficial fungal associations with plant roots.
5.  Penicillin is an example of a fungal product.


How many of the above accurately describe characteristics or roles of fungi?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fungi possess cell walls composed of chitin.  They are heterotrophic, not autotrophic, obtaining nutrients by decomposing organic matter or through parasitic relationships.  They are crucial decomposers in ecosystems. Mycorrhizae are indeed mutually beneficial associations between fungi and plant roots.  Penicillin is a well-known antibiotic derived from fungi.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):**

1.  It is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.
2.  It functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change.
3.  The CPCB, along with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), is responsible for implementing the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
4.  The CPCB's primary function is to promote the cleanliness of streams and wells, aiming to improve air quality in the country.

**Which of the above statements is/are correct?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CPCB is indeed a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (statement 1 is correct).  It operates under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (statement 2 is correct). The CPCB, in conjunction with SPCBs, is responsible for implementing legislation related to preventing and controlling air pollution, stemming from the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 (statement 3 is correct).  While the CPCB aims to improve air and water quality (as a consequence of its broader mandate),  statement 4 is an oversimplification of its extensive responsibilities.  The CPCB's functions extend far beyond just promoting the cleanliness of streams and wells.  Its role encompasses a wide range of environmental regulations and monitoring activities. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the National Green Tribunal (NGT):**

1.  The NGT receives cases related to environmental issues.
2.  The NGT is a constitutional body established under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution.
3.  The NGT's jurisdiction extends to civil cases only.
4.  The NGT's orders are binding on all parties involved.


**How many of the above statements are correct?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NGT does handle environmental cases. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The NGT is not a constitutional body; it was established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, not the Constitution. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The NGT's jurisdiction isn't limited to civil cases; it can also address criminal aspects related to environmental violations.  Finally, statement 4 is correct; the NGT's orders are legally binding on those involved in the cases. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) are accurate.


**3. Consider the following organizations related to water resource management in India:**

1.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)
2.  National Water Resources Council (NWRC)
3.  Ministry of Jal Shakti
4.  The Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW)


**How many of these organizations are primarily involved in the management of water resources within India?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CGWB is directly involved in groundwater management in India (correct). The Ministry of Jal Shakti plays a crucial role in overall water resource management in India (correct). The NWRC also contributes to water resource policy and planning in India (correct).  The GCEW, however, is an international commission, not specifically focused on India's water resources.  Therefore, only three of the listed organizations are primarily concerned with water resource management within India.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index 2023-24:**

1.  It is published by the NITI Aayog.
2.  The index measures progress across all states and union territories on 17 goals.
3.  A score of 100 indicates complete achievement of the targets set for 2030.
4.  The index uses a total of 200 indicators for assessment.


**Which of the statements above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The NITI Aayog does publish the SDG India Index. Statement 3 is also correct: A score of 100 signifies the complete achievement of the 2030 targets. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The index assesses progress across states and union territories on 17 goals, but the number of indicators used is 113, not 17 or 200 (making statement 4 incorrect).  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Global Framework on Chemicals and Waste (GFC) Fund:**

1. It was established during the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5) in 2023.
2. The fund's primary objective is to support high-income countries in managing chemicals and waste.
3.  The fund complements existing financial mechanisms, such as the Global Environment Facility.
4. Project funding typically ranges from 100,000 to 500,000 USD.


**How many of the above statements are accurate?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The GFC Fund was indeed established during ICCM5 in 2023. Statement 3 is also correct: The fund does work in conjunction with existing mechanisms like the Global Environment Facility. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The fund's main focus is on supporting low- and middle-income countries, not high-income ones.  Furthermore, statement 4 is incorrect; the funding amount is significantly higher, ranging from 300,000 to 800,000 USD, not 100,000 to 500,000 USD. Hence, only two statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following about the UNFCCC COP29:**

1.  It was held in Baku, Azerbaijan.
2.  The main outcome was the Baku Climate Unity Pact.
3.  COP30 will be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
4. The conference finalized rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.


**Which of the above statements are correct?**

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: COP29 did take place in Baku, Azerbaijan. Statement 2 is also correct: The Baku Climate Unity Pact was a key outcome. Statement 4 is correct: Rules for Article 6 were finalized. However, statement 3 is incorrect; COP30 is scheduled for Belém, Brazil, not Dubai. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**7. Consider the following related to India's stance at COP29:**

1. India proposed a goal of USD 1 trillion annually under the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG).
2. India opposed changes to the scope of the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP).
3. India supported the use of third-party databases for measuring adaptation progress.
4. India co-hosted the LeadIT Meet with Sweden.


**Which of the above accurately reflects India's position at COP29?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: India did oppose alterations to the MWP. Statement 4 is also correct: The LeadIT Meet was co-hosted.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; India's proposed figure under the NCQG was USD 1.3 trillion, not USD 1 trillion.  Furthermore, statement 3 is incorrect; India opposed the use of third-party databases for measuring adaptation progress.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately represent India's stance at COP29.


**8. Consider the following about the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI):**

1. Uttarakhand was the first Indian state to launch a GEPI.
2.  GEPI assesses ecological development through four pillars: air, soil, water, and forests.
3. GEPI quantifies the contributions of natural ecosystems to the economy and overall welfare.
4. GEPI is calculated by adding the indices of all four pillars.


**Which of the above statements concerning GEPI are correct?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the statements accurately describe the GEPI. Uttarakhand was indeed the first state to implement it (statement 1).  The index uses four pillars: air, soil, water, and forests (statement 2). It aims to quantify the contributions of natural ecosystems to the economy (statement 3).  The overall GEPI is calculated by summing the individual indices of the four pillars (statement 4).  Therefore, all statements are correct.



**9. Consider the following about the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA):**

1.  The SEEA is an internationally agreed framework.
2. The SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) measures ecosystems and their services.
3.  The SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) measures individual resources used by the economy.
4.  EnviStats India utilizes the SEEA framework.


**How many of these statements are correct?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The SEEA is an internationally recognized framework. Statement 4 is also correct: EnviStats India does use the SEEA framework. However, statements 2 and 3 are reversed. The SEEA-CF measures individual resources (like timber, water), while SEEA-EA focuses on ecosystems and their services.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following related to Biosphere Reserves in India:**

1.  The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve was the first to be recognized under the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme.
2.  Biosphere reserves consist of core, buffer, and transition zones.
3.  Currently, there are 18 biosphere reserves in India recognized under the MAB Programme.
4.  Biosphere reserves primarily focus on ex-situ conservation.


**Which of the above statements regarding Biosphere Reserves are true?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve was the first in India to receive recognition under the MAB Programme. Statement 2 is also correct: Biosphere reserves have the three zones mentioned. Statement 3 is correct:  India has 18 biosphere reserves recognized under the MAB Programme. However, statement 4 is incorrect. Biosphere reserves focus on *in-situ* conservation, not ex-situ conservation (which involves conserving species outside their natural habitats).  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Project Tiger
2.  Project Dolphin
3.  Project Lion
4.  Project Elephant
5.  People's Biodiversity Register (PBR)

How many of the above are sub-schemes under the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Project Tiger (1973), Project Dolphin, Project Lion, and Project Elephant (1992) are all explicitly mentioned in the provided text as sub-schemes under the IDWH.  The People's Biodiversity Register (PBR), while related to biodiversity conservation, is a separate initiative stemming from the Biological Diversity Act (2002) and managed by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) at the local level.  It's not a sub-scheme directly under the IDWH, which is a centrally sponsored umbrella scheme managed by the Ministry of Environment. Therefore, only four of the listed items are sub-schemes under IDWH.  The options are designed to be confusing, as all the listed projects relate to wildlife conservation, but only a subset fall under the specific IDWH umbrella.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
2.  Environmental Performance Index (EPI)
3.  Nature Conservation Index (NCI)
4.  State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report

How many of the above indices or reports provide a ranking or assessment of countries based on their environmental performance or conservation efforts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IUCN Red List, while crucial for conservation, categorizes species based on their risk of extinction, not countries based on their conservation efforts. The EPI, NCI, and the State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report all explicitly rank or assess countries. The EPI ranks countries on climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. The NCI evaluates countries' conservation efforts using four markers. The State of the World’s Mangroves 2024 report assesses the status of mangrove ecosystems in different regions and countries, implying a form of ranking or assessment based on conservation status.  Therefore, three of the listed items provide country rankings or assessments related to environmental performance or conservation.  The distractor is the IUCN Red List, which is a frequently cited conservation tool but doesn't focus on national-level rankings.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA)
2.  Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC)
3.  Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC)
4.  Bombay Natural History Society

How many of the above are organizations or initiatives directly involved in big cat conservation or tiger conservation specifically?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IBCA aims to strengthen global cooperation for the conservation of seven big cat species. The TCC brings together leading biologists and experts focused on tiger conservation. The SFTLC seeks to increase financial support for tiger protection.  The Bombay Natural History Society, while not explicitly mentioned as focusing solely on big cats, is a long-standing organization deeply involved in Indian wildlife conservation and would likely participate in or collaborate with initiatives like those listed.  Therefore, all four entities are directly or indirectly involved in big cat or tiger conservation.  The inclusion of the Bombay Natural History Society as a distractor plays on its general reputation in wildlife conservation, potentially leading candidates to overlook its relevance to big cat conservation specifically.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH)
2.  Project Elephant
3.  National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)
4.  Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change

How many of the above are involved in funding or implementing wildlife conservation projects in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IDWH is a centrally sponsored scheme providing support for wildlife conservation. Project Elephant is a specific sub-scheme under IDWH. CAMPA is a funding agency that supports projects such as the Bustard Recovery Project.  The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change is the overarching governmental body responsible for overseeing and coordinating much of India’s environmental and wildlife conservation efforts.  Thus, all four are involved in funding or implementing wildlife conservation projects.  The question's difficulty stems from the hierarchical relationship between these entities, requiring a nuanced understanding of their roles.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the conservation of rhinos:**

1.  The International Rhino Foundation (IRF) focuses solely on the conservation of black rhinos.
2.  Rhino poaching in Africa increased between 2022 and 2023.
3.  The number of greater one-horned rhinos (Indian rhinos) remained the same between the reporting periods.
4.  There are fewer than 28,000 rhinos worldwide.

How many of the above statements are correct according to the provided information?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While originally called the International Black Rhino Foundation, the IRF now works to protect all rhino species. Statement 2 is correct, as the text states that rhino poaching in Africa increased by 4% from 2022 to 2023. Statement 3 is also correct, citing the report's finding that the number of greater one-horned rhinos remained unchanged. Statement 4 is correct; the report indicates there are just under 28,000 rhinos left worldwide.  Therefore, three out of the four statements are accurate. The distractor is the initial name of the IRF, potentially misleading candidates who only remember its original focus.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The Paro Statement
2.  The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework
3.  The Paris Agreement
4.  Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)

How many of the above are international agreements or frameworks related to environmental conservation or climate change mitigation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Paro Statement is associated with the SFTLC and relates to increased financial support for tiger conservation. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework is an international agreement under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The Paris Agreement is a global accord on climate change. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are commitments by individual countries under the Paris Agreement.  All four items are thus linked to international agreements or frameworks addressing environmental concerns or climate change.  The inclusion of the Paro Statement, a less widely known agreement, adds difficulty by requiring a deeper understanding of the text's content.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)
2.  Committee for Air Quality Management
3.  National Green Tribunal (NGT)
4.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)

How many of the above are Indian governmental bodies or tribunals involved in environmental regulation or monitoring?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CGWB monitors and manages groundwater resources. The Committee for Air Quality Management addresses air pollution issues. The NGT is a specialized tribunal addressing environmental disputes. The CPCB is a statutory body responsible for implementing pollution control legislation.  Therefore, all four are Indian governmental entities involved in environmental regulation or monitoring.  The question's difficulty lies in the diversity of their mandates within the broader field of environmental governance.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) India Index 2023-24
2.  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR)
3.  Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor (CCRM) report
4.  UN Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals (CETMs)

How many of the above are reports or indices assessing sustainability performance of countries or businesses?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The SDG India Index measures national progress on SDGs. BRSR assesses the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of companies. The CCRM report assesses the climate strategies of major global companies. The UN panel on CETMs focuses on the responsible sourcing and use of critical minerals, which is directly related to sustainability assessments.  Therefore, all four assess sustainability performance at either a national or business level. The diversity of the subjects assessed (national progress, corporate performance, and mineral sourcing) adds complexity to the question.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  MISHTI (Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes)
2.  Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH)
3.  Project Tiger
4.  Bustard Recovery Project

How many of the above are specifically focused on the conservation of a particular species or habitat type?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MISHTI focuses on mangrove conservation. IDWH is a broader scheme encompassing various wildlife habitats and species. Project Tiger is dedicated to tiger conservation. The Bustard Recovery Project is specifically for bustards.  Therefore, three of the initiatives focus on a specific species or habitat. The inclusion of IDWH as a distractor plays on its broad scope, possibly leading candidates to incorrectly include it.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs)
2.  Western Ghats
3.  Brahmagiri hills
4.  High Level Working Group (HLWG) headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan

How many of the above are directly related to the designation or management of ecologically sensitive areas in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ESZs are designated areas for environmental protection. The Western Ghats is a specific region frequently discussed in relation to ESZ designation. The Brahmagiri hills are mentioned in relation to a National Green Tribunal (NGT) case concerning the Western Ghats' ESZ. The HLWG, headed by Dr. Kasturirangan, made recommendations on ESZ management in the Western Ghats.  All four are, therefore, directly related to the designation or management of ecologically sensitive areas. The inclusion of the HLWG as a distractor plays on its advisory role, potentially leading candidates to overlook its direct involvement in ESZ matters.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on environment-related topics.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding environmental movements in India:**

1. The Chipko movement, originating in Rajasthan, primarily involved men protesting deforestation.
2. The Silent Valley movement opposed the construction of a hydroelectric dam in Kerala.
3. The Appiko movement, led by Panduranga Hegde, focused on forest conservation in the Western Ghats of Karnataka.
4. The Narmada Bachao Andolan was spearheaded by Medha Patkar against dam construction on the Narmada river.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Silent Valley movement in Kerala, the Appiko movement in Karnataka's Western Ghats, and the Narmada Bachao Andolan against the Narmada dam are all well-documented environmental movements in India.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bishnoi community in Rajasthan has a long history of environmental protection and the Chipko movement's roots can be traced back to similar movements, the Chipko movement itself primarily took place in Uttarakhand and involved significant participation from women, not just men.  The movement's focus was on preventing deforestation.


**2. Consider the following regarding the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA):**

1. SEEA is a nationally-agreed framework for compiling environmental-economic accounts.
2. SEEA-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) primarily measures ecosystem services.
3. SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) focuses on individual environmental resources and their use by the economy.
4. EnviStats India 2024, compiled using the SEEA framework, highlights India's leadership in energy transition.

Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. SEEA is an internationally agreed framework, not just a national one, and EnviStats India 2024 does highlight India's progress in energy transition. However, statements 2 and 3 are incorrect.

3. India strongly supported the inclusion of third-party databases in measuring progress on adaptation.
4. India supported the establishment of the Baku Road Map.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's position at COP29?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly represent India's stance at COP29.  India did indeed propose a significantly ambitious annual climate finance goal of $1.3 trillion under the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), emphasizing the need for substantial grant-based funding from developed nations.  Furthermore, India consistently stressed the responsibility of developed countries to provide both financial and technological assistance to developing nations to facilitate a just transition towards cleaner energy sources and climate resilience.  Finally, India's support for the Baku Road Map, likely a framework for future climate action, aligns with its active participation in international climate negotiations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India, along with many developing nations, often expresses concerns about the reliability and potential biases in third-party climate data, preferring to rely on national reporting mechanisms and promoting greater transparency and equity in data collection and assessment.  The reliance on third-party databases can be seen as a point of contention in international climate negotiations, often raising concerns about data accuracy and sovereignty.


**2. Consider the following features related to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement:**

1. It establishes a global carbon market under a centralized approach.
2. It allows for bilateral cooperation through a decentralized approach, involving the trading of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs).
3. It exclusively focuses on market-based approaches for international carbon trading.
4.  It includes a non-market-based approach to promote mitigation and adaptation.


Which of the above accurately describe mechanisms under Article 6?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is multifaceted, encompassing both market-based and non-market-based approaches to international cooperation on climate action.  Statement 2 accurately reflects Article 6.2, which outlines a decentralized approach for bilateral cooperation involving the trading of ITMOs (emissions reductions achieved through mitigation actions).  Statement 4 accurately describes Article 6.8, which focuses on non-market-based approaches to promote both mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Statement 1 is incorrect as it oversimplifies Article 6. While Article 6.4 does involve a centralized approach to carbon trading, it's not the sole mechanism.  Statement 3 is also incorrect because Article 6 explicitly includes both market-based (Articles 6.2 and 6.4) and non-market-based (Article 6.8) approaches.  The inclusion of non-market approaches reflects the diversity of national circumstances and the need for flexible mechanisms to address climate change.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. India *opposed* the use of third-party databases for measuring adaptation progress, preferring instead to rely on its own data and methodologies.  This reflects a concern about data sovereignty and the potential for bias in externally sourced data.


**2. Consider the following mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement:**

1.  Article 6.2, focusing on decentralized bilateral cooperation for carbon credit trading.
2.  Article 6.4, establishing a centralized global carbon market under the Paris Agreement.
3.  Article 6.8, promoting non-market-based approaches to mitigation and adaptation.
4.  The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a precursor to Article 6 mechanisms.

Which of the above are considered market-based approaches to achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 6.2 and 6.4 are explicitly market-based mechanisms.  Article 6.2 facilitates bilateral cooperation and trading of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) in a decentralized manner.  Article 6.4 establishes a centralized international carbon market, offering a different approach to carbon trading.

Article 6.8 is explicitly a *non*-market-based approach, focusing on cooperation and collaboration rather than financial transactions for emissions reductions.  The Kyoto Protocol's CDM, while historically important, is not a mechanism under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; it's a separate, earlier initiative.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Gape Limitation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gape limitation is a fundamental ecological concept that describes the physical constraint on the size of prey an animal can consume, primarily determined by the size of its mouth (gape).  Statement 1 is correct; the gape size directly limits what a predator can eat. Statement 3 is also correct as gape limitation significantly influences the structure of food webs. The predator-prey relationships are directly affected by the size of prey available to a predator due to its gape limitation, which in turn drives adaptations in both predator and prey species to optimize feeding efficiency and survival. For example, a predator with a small gape may evolve strategies for targeting smaller prey, while prey species may develop defenses to avoid predation. Statement 4 is incorrect; Gape limitation can be an important factor in predicting how environmental changes, such as changes in prey availability or the introduction of invasive species, will affect predator-prey interactions and the overall ecosystem stability.  Statement 2 is partially true but is oversimplified. While the predator’s mouth size is the primary determinant, other factors such as jaw strength and overall body size can indirectly influence the size of prey a predator can successfully capture and consume.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately and completely describe gape limitation.

2.  The Conference of Parties (COP) is the primary decision-making body under the agreement.
3.  The agreement establishes a clearing-house mechanism for open-access centralized information.
4.  The financial mechanism relies solely on mandatory contributions from member states.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct. The BBNJ Agreement does indeed establish a Conference of Parties (COP) as its main decision-making body, responsible for overseeing the implementation and further development of the agreement's provisions.  It also creates a clearing-house mechanism (CHM) to facilitate the sharing of information and data related to marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. This mechanism is designed to be an open-access, centralized platform, ensuring transparency and collaboration among participating nations.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BBNJ Agreement specifically excludes warships, military aircraft, and naval auxiliaries from its application.  This is a crucial exemption acknowledging the distinct operational nature of military vessels and their activities in international waters.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The BBNJ Agreement's financial mechanism includes a voluntary trust fund, a special trust fund, and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) fund.  The reliance on voluntary contributions highlights the collaborative and flexible nature of international environmental cooperation in addressing shared challenges. The absence of mandatory contributions reflects the sensitivity of imposing financial obligations on diverse nations with varying economic capacities.

1.  POPs are exclusively synthetic chemicals with carbon-based structures.
2.  The Stockholm Convention addresses only pesticides categorized as POPs.
3.  Bioaccumulation of POPs is facilitated by their high lipid solubility.
4.  DDT is a POP that has shown a significant increase in human milk samples since 2004.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many POPs are synthetic, some are naturally occurring.  The definition focuses on persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation, not solely origin.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Stockholm Convention is a broad international treaty addressing a range of persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides, industrial chemicals, and unintentional by-products of industrial processes.  It's not limited solely to pesticides.

Statement 3 is correct.  The high lipid solubility of POPs is a key characteristic that allows them to accumulate in the fatty tissues of living organisms, leading to biomagnification in the food chain.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that DDT levels in human milk have *decreased* by over 70% since 2004.  This decrease is attributed to reduced use, highlighting the effectiveness of international agreements and regulations aimed at reducing POPs.

4.  Current regulations list all sub-groups of PFAS under the Stockholm Convention as industrial POPs.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. BPA is used in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, not polyethylene plastics.  Polyethylene is a different type of plastic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PFAS are indeed called "forever chemicals" because they persist in the environment and human bodies and break down extremely slowly.  The statement incorrectly implies rapid breakdown.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the negative health impacts of BPA exposure on the brain and prostate gland, particularly in vulnerable populations.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While three subgroups of PFAS are listed under the Stockholm Convention, the statement incorrectly claims that *all* subgroups are listed.

2.  Leaching of nitrogen from ammonium-based fertilizers accelerates soil acidification.
3.  The use of lime is a common method for managing acid soils.
4.  Growing acid-tolerant crops like rice and wheat is a recommended management strategy.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Soil acidification *decreases* soil pH, making the soil more acidic.  An increase in pH would indicate alkalinization.

Statement 2 is correct. The leaching of nitrogen from ammonium-based fertilizers contributes to the lowering of soil pH, accelerating acidification.

Statement 3 is correct. Liming (adding lime) is a standard practice to counteract soil acidity by raising the pH.

Statement 4 is partially correct but needs clarification.  While growing acid-tolerant crops is a management strategy, rice and wheat are not necessarily the best examples. Sugarcane and bananas are mentioned in the text as better examples of acid-tolerant crops.  The inclusion of rice and wheat as examples makes the statement partially incorrect.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the “grasshopper effect” and its implications:**

1. The grasshopper effect primarily describes the transport of plastic and toxic chemicals from the Arctic to lower latitudes.
2. The Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) released a report focusing on the grasshopper effect in the Arctic.
3. The grasshopper effect is a phenomenon where pollutants are transported through atmospheric and oceanic currents, accumulating in areas far from their source.
4. Global distillation is an alternate term used to describe the grasshopper effect.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The grasshopper effect describes the transport of pollutants from lower latitudes *to* the Arctic, not the other way around.  The Arctic acts as a sink for these pollutants.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly states that ACAT and IPEN released a report discussing the grasshopper effect and its impact on the Arctic.

Statement 3 is correct. This accurately describes the mechanism of the grasshopper effect: long-range transport of pollutants via atmospheric and oceanic currents.

Statement 4 is correct. The text uses "global distillation" as a synonym for the grasshopper effect.


**5. Consider the following regarding the  Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024:**

1. The FWI report is published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
2. The report tracks global food waste at the production and supply chain levels.
3. The report supports the goals of SDG 12.3, specifically indicators 12.3.1(a) and 12.3.1(b).
4.  The report found that households globally wasted less than half a billion meals daily in 2022.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Food Waste Index (FWI)  is relevant to SDG 12.3 which is partially tracked by FAO, the report itself is a joint publication of the UNEP and WRAP, not solely the FAO.  The Food Loss Index (FLI) is tracked by FAO

Statement 2 is partially correct. The FWI tracks waste at retail and consumer levels, but not explicitly at the production and supply chain levels (that's the Food Loss Index).

Statement 3 is correct. The report directly supports the goals of SDG 12.3, specifically indicators 12.3.1(a) and 12.3.1(b), related to reducing food loss and waste.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The report found that households wasted *over* 1 billion meals a day in 2022, a significantly higher number.

4.  The UN-REDD Programme primarily focuses on advancing the Kyoto Protocol.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UN-REDD addresses afforestation and reforestation, its primary focus is on reducing emissions from *deforestation* and forest degradation.

Statement 2 is correct. The report's key findings highlight the limited number of countries with quantified forest targets in their NDCs.

Statement 3 is correct. The text describes UN-REDD as a flagship UN programme on forests and climate change.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The UN-REDD Programme is focused on advancing the *Paris Agreement*, not the Kyoto Protocol.  The Paris Agreement is the more recent and currently active international climate treaty.



**1. Consider the following aspects of Fungi:**

1.  Cell wall composition
2.  Mode of nutrition
3.  Body organization
4.  Ecological roles
5.  Economic significance

How many of the above aspects correctly describe the characteristics and importance of Fungi in ecosystems?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five aspects accurately reflect key features of Fungi.  Fungi possess cell walls composed of chitin, a characteristic that distinguishes them from plants (cellulose cell walls) and animals (lacking cell walls). Their mode of nutrition is heterotrophic, meaning they obtain nutrients from organic sources, either as saprophytes (decomposers) or parasites.  Fungal body organization can range from unicellular (yeasts) to complex multicellular structures (mushrooms) with a loose tissue structure (hyphae).  Ecologically, fungi play crucial roles as decomposers, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients.  Economically, they have significant applications in medicine (e.g., penicillin), food production (e.g., fermentation), and bioremediation (e.g., mycoremediation of pollutants).  Therefore, all five statements accurately describe the characteristics and importance of Fungi. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the multifaceted nature of Fungi's characteristics and ecological roles.

4.  It primarily focuses on marine ecosystems.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The WNBR is indeed managed under UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme.  Statement 2 is also correct as the network encompasses sites in more than 136 countries.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the WNBR is a program of UNESCO, not UNEP.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the WNBR includes marine biosphere reserves, it's not exclusively focused on marine ecosystems; it encompasses terrestrial, freshwater, and coastal-marine sites.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the number of correct statements.


**3. Consider the following factors related to coral bleaching:**

1.  Increased ocean salinity
2.  Elevated ocean temperatures
3.  Reduced sunlight penetration
4.  Ocean acidification
5.  Overfishing

How many of the above factors are directly implicated in causing coral bleaching events?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Elevated ocean temperatures (2), reduced sunlight penetration (3), and ocean acidification (4) are all major stressors that contribute significantly to coral bleaching.  Increased ocean temperature causes corals to expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae, leading to bleaching.  Reduced sunlight can also disrupt the symbiotic relationship between corals and algae.  Ocean acidification makes it harder for corals to build and maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons. While overfishing can indirectly affect coral reef health by altering the ecosystem balance, it's not a direct cause of coral bleaching in the same way as the other three factors.  Increased ocean salinity is not a primary cause of coral bleaching; in fact, salinity changes can be a consequence of other environmental changes.  Therefore, only three of the listed factors (2, 3, and 4) are directly linked to coral bleaching. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either underestimate or overestimate the number of direct causal factors.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of megafauna?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Megafauna are defined by a weight threshold (generally above 50kg, not 25kg), making statement 1 incorrect.  Megafauna are not exclusively herbivores; they include megaherbivores, megacarnivores, and megaomnivores. Statement 3 is correct: Megafauna are highly vulnerable to human impacts. Statement 4 is correct: Woolly mammoths are a prime example of extinct megafauna.  Statement 5 is incorrect; megafauna can inhabit both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  Therefore, only three statements (3, 4, and a modified version of 2 acknowledging the diverse diets) are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to over or underestimation of accurate statements.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; eDNA is derived from various organismal materials (skin, excrement, etc.), not only animal tissues.  Statement 2 is incorrect; eDNA analysis is increasingly cost-effective and faster than traditional methods. Statement 3 is correct; eDNA is a powerful tool for biodiversity assessments.  Statement 4 is correct; eDNA data informs species presence and abundance, contributing to the IUCN Red List. Statement 5 is incorrect; eDNA analysis is applicable in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.  Therefore, only three statements (3, 4, and a modified version of 1) are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to misinterpretations of eDNA's properties and applications.


**6. Consider the following regarding modes of speciation:**

1.  Allopatric speciation requires significant gene flow.
2.  Peripatric speciation involves the isolation of a small peripheral population.
3.  Parapatric speciation occurs without geographic isolation.
4.  Sympatric speciation can occur in overlapping populations.
5.  Allopatric speciation always results in complete reproductive isolation.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics of different speciation modes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; allopatric speciation involves geographic isolation, limiting gene flow.  Statement 2 is correct; peripatric speciation involves the isolation of a small, peripheral population. Statement 3 is incorrect; parapatric speciation occurs along an environmental gradient, but some degree of geographic separation is usually involved. Statement 4 is correct; sympatric speciation can occur within the same geographic area through mechanisms like sexual selection or polyploidy. Statement 5 is incorrect; allopatric speciation may not always lead to complete reproductive isolation immediately.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are completely accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the number of completely accurate statements.


**7. Consider the following concerning bioluminescence:**

Thus, all four statements provide accurate and differentiating information.


3. Consider the following regarding the impact of climate change on cyclones:

1. Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) contribute to more frequent and intense cyclones globally.
2. Cyclones in Southeast Asia now form closer to coasts, intensify more rapidly, and linger longer over land due to rising SSTs.
3. The ratio of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea is approximately 4:1, and this ratio remains unchanged despite climate change.
4. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) uses a color-coded warning system (Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) to alert populations about approaching cyclones, with Green issued 72 hours in advance.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the impacts of climate change on cyclones and cyclone warning systems?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of climate change's impact on cyclones and warning systems. Warmer SSTs provide more energy for cyclone formation, leading to increased intensity and frequency (1).  The observation that Southeast Asian cyclones are exhibiting coastal proximity, rapid intensification, and prolonged landfall durations is directly linked to rising SSTs (2). The IMD's color-coded warning system is also accurately described, with the Green alert issued 72 hours before a cyclone's anticipated landfall (4). Statement 3 is incorrect; while the 4:1 ratio might have been historically true, climate change is altering cyclone patterns, making it less accurate to state this ratio remains unchanged.

1. Coral bleaching is caused by the expulsion of zooxanthellae from coral polyps.
2.  Increased ocean temperatures are a major trigger for coral bleaching.
3.  Coral bleaching primarily affects hard corals and not soft corals.
4.  Coral reefs are important for biodiversity and coastal protection.
5.  Coral bleaching is a reversible process, and corals always recover fully.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that live within their tissues, causing them to lose their color and become vulnerable.

Statement 2 is correct. Rising ocean temperatures are a primary driver of coral bleaching, stressing the symbiotic relationship between corals and zooxanthellae.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While hard corals are more susceptible, soft corals can also be affected by bleaching, though the impacts may differ.

Statement 4 is correct. Coral reefs are highly biodiverse ecosystems, supporting a vast array of marine life, and also providing crucial coastal protection against storms and erosion.

Statement 5 is incorrect. While some corals can recover from bleaching events, the extent of recovery depends on the severity and duration of the stress, and many bleached corals die.  Therefore, four statements are correct.

    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) Only three
    (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 correctly identifies a benefit of UCG.  UCG needs less land than coal bed methane extraction (Statement 2 is incorrect). Statement 3 correctly points out a concern. The National Coal Gasification Mission aims for 100 MT, not 50 MT (Statement 4 is incorrect). Therefore, only three statements are correct.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on environmental topics and adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's climate negotiation stance at COP29:**

1.  India advocated for a yearly allocation of $1.3 trillion under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) framework.
2.  India supported modifications to the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) to align with stricter temperature reduction targets.
3.  India emphasized the necessity of developed nations providing financial and technological assistance for a just energy transition in developing countries.
4. India opposed the creation of follow-up mechanisms to assess the Global Stocktake (GST) outcomes.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect India's position at COP29?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India proposed a substantial annual financial commitment of $1.3 trillion, with a significant portion coming from grants or equivalent resources, under the Nationally Determined Contributions framework. This reflects India's push for greater financial support from developed nations for climate action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India actively *opposed* changes to the scope of the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) and attempts to alter temperature goals in the Paris Agreement.  This indicates a stance of maintaining the existing framework rather than accepting potentially more stringent targets.

Statement 3 is correct.  India strongly advocated for developed countries to provide the necessary financial and technological support to developing countries for a just transition. This reflects a core principle of climate justice, emphasizing the responsibility of historically high-emitting nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.

Statement 4 is correct. India criticized the lack of connection between finance and mitigation in the dialogue text and opposed the establishment of follow-up mechanisms for the Global Stocktake (GST) outcomes.  This suggests a preference for a less prescriptive approach to monitoring and evaluation of climate action.


**2. Consider the following organizations involved in environmental governance:**

1.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
2.  National Green Tribunal (NGT)
3.  Committee for Air Quality Management (CAQM)
4.  Global Commission on the Economics of Water (GCEW)

How many of the above are primarily focused on environmental regulation and enforcement within India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c) Only three

**Explanation:**

The CPCB, NGT, and CAQM are all significantly involved in environmental regulation and enforcement within India. The CPCB is a statutory body responsible for implementing environmental legislation at the national level, while the NGT is a specialized tribunal dealing with environmental disputes. The CAQM addresses air quality issues in specific regions.  These three organizations are all focused on the domestic Indian context.

The GCEW, however, is an international commission focusing on global water resource management and economics; its primary focus is not on domestic Indian environmental regulation. Therefore, only three of the listed organizations are primarily focused on environmental regulation and enforcement within India.


**3. Consider the following aspects of India's environmental initiatives:**

1.  The Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme.
2.  The publication of EnviStats India.
3.  The People's Biodiversity Register (PBR).
4.  The adoption of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA).

How many of the above initiatives directly involve the documentation and/or management of India's biodiversity resources?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b) Only two

**Explanation:**

The IDWH scheme focuses on habitat protection and wildlife conservation, thus directly involving biodiversity management.  The PBR is explicitly designed to document local biological resources and associated traditional knowledge, making it a cornerstone of community-based biodiversity conservation.

EnviStats India, while providing comprehensive environmental data, is a statistical publication and not directly involved in biodiversity documentation or management. Similarly, SEEA is an international accounting framework that helps measure environmental assets, but it doesn't focus specifically on biodiversity management in India.  Therefore, only two of the listed initiatives directly involve the documentation and/or management of India's biodiversity resources.


**4. Consider the following international indices related to environmental performance:**

1.  Environmental Performance Index (EPI)
2.  Nature Conservation Index (NCI)
3.  Energy Transition Index (ETI)
4.  Global Stocktake (GST)

How many of the above are used to rank or assess countries based on their environmental performance or progress towards sustainability goals?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c) Only three

**Explanation:**

The EPI, NCI, and ETI are all indices used to rank countries based on various aspects of their environmental performance. The EPI assesses climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. The NCI focuses on nature conservation efforts. The ETI evaluates countries' energy systems and their transition towards cleaner energy sources.

The Global Stocktake (GST) is a process under the Paris Agreement for reviewing collective progress toward climate goals; it is not an index used to rank countries. Therefore, only three of the options are indices used to rank or assess countries based on their environmental performance or progress towards sustainability goals.


**5. Consider the following related to India's approach to Just Energy Transition:**

1.  The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP).
2.  The Renewable Energy Technology Action Partnership (RETAP).
3.  The participation in the Second Annual High-Level Ministerial Round Table on Just Transition at COP29.
4.  The adoption of the ILO Guidelines for a Just Transition.

How many of the above represent specific initiatives or engagements undertaken by India to facilitate a just energy transition?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

All four options represent specific actions or commitments undertaken by India in the context of a just energy transition. The JETP is a major international partnership, RETAP is a bilateral initiative, participation in the ministerial roundtable demonstrates active engagement in international discussions, and the adoption of the ILO guidelines reflects a commitment to internationally recognized principles of just transition.  Therefore, all four options are relevant to India's approach to this crucial aspect of climate action.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement:**

1.  It applies to all areas beyond national jurisdiction, including warships and military aircraft.
2.  The Conference of Parties (COP) is the main decision-making body established by the treaty.
3.  The agreement establishes a Clearing-House Mechanism (CHM) as an open-access centralized platform.
4.  The financial mechanism solely relies on mandatory contributions from member states.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct. The BBNJ Agreement does establish a COP as its primary decision-making body and a CHM as an open-access platform for information sharing.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The agreement explicitly excludes warships, military aircraft, and naval auxiliaries from its application.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the financial mechanism includes a voluntary trust fund, a special trust fund, and the Global Environment Facility, indicating a mix of voluntary and potentially other funding sources, not solely mandatory contributions.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS):**

1. It was adopted in 1994 and enforced in 1982.
2. It demarcates the contiguous zone up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline.
3.  It classifies high seas as global commons, belonging to no single nation.
4. It has near-universal acceptance, with fewer than 100 state parties.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of UNCLOS?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. UNCLOS does indeed classify high seas as global commons accessible to all nations.  However, statement 1 incorrectly reverses the adoption and enforcement dates. UNCLOS was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994. Statement 2 is incorrect; the contiguous zone extends to 24 nautical miles, not 12, from the baseline.  Finally, statement 4 is incorrect as UNCLOS enjoys almost universal acceptance with over 170 state parties, far exceeding the number mentioned in the statement.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's stance at COP29:**

1. India proposed an annual climate action investment goal of $6.7 trillion under the National Clean Ganga Qust (NCQG).
2. India supported changes to the scope of the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) and alterations to temperature goals in the Paris Agreement.
3. India advocated for developed countries to provide financial and technological support to developing countries for a just transition.
4. India opposed the establishment of the Baku Road Map.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's position at COP29?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 correctly reflects India's position.  India consistently emphasizes the need for developed nations to support developing countries' climate actions. Statement 1 is incorrect; India proposed a significantly lower annual investment goal of $1.3 trillion, not $6.7 trillion, under the NCQG.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India opposed changes to the MWP and temperature goals.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; India supported the establishment of the Baku Road Map. Therefore, only one statement accurately represents India's stance at COP29.


**4. Consider the following elements related to Biosphere Reserves under the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme:**

1.  The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve was the last to be recognized under the MAB Programme in India.
2.  There are a total of 18 biosphere reserves in India, with 12 recognized under the MAB Programme.
3.  Biosphere reserves consist of core areas, buffer zones, and transition areas.
4.  The MAB Programme was launched in 1991.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of Biosphere Reserves and the MAB Programme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  India has 18 biosphere reserves, with 12 recognized under the MAB Programme. The three-zone structure (core, buffer, and transition) is a key feature of biosphere reserves. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve was the *first*, not the last, to be recognized in India.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the MAB Programme was launched in 1971, not 1991. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following concerning Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs):**

1. ESZs are notified by state governments under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
2.  The Kasturirangan Committee proposed that 60,000 square kilometers of the Western Ghats be designated as ESZ.
3.  ESZs are categorized into three sensitivity levels: ESZ1, ESZ2, and ESZ3.
4.  The primary purpose of ESZs is to promote intensive industrial development within ecologically sensitive areas.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features of ESZs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Kasturirangan Committee did propose a significant area of the Western Ghats as an ESZ, and the tiered sensitivity levels (ESZ1, ESZ2, ESZ3) are a feature of ESZ management. However, statement 1 is incorrect; ESZs are notified by the *central*, not state, government under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the purpose of ESZs is to *protect* the environment and avoid degradation from human activities, not to promote industrial development.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):**

1. The CPCB is a statutory body formed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
2.  It functions under the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation.
3.  The CPCB, along with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs), is responsible for implementing environmental pollution control legislation.
4.  A primary function of the CPCB is promoting the cleanliness of streams and wells.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the CPCB's roles and functions?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The CPCB was established under the Water Act but also has powers under the Air Act.  Promoting water and air quality is a core function. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the CPCB functions under the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, not the Ministry of Water Resources. While statement 3 is largely correct, the phrasing is slightly misleading. The CPCB and SPCBs *jointly* implement legislation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are completely accurate.


**7. Consider the following related to India's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

1. The SDG India Index 2023-24 is the third edition of the report.
2. The index measures progress on 113 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework.
3.  A score of 100 indicates that a state/UT has achieved all SDG targets for 2030.
4.  States are categorized into three groups based on their scores: Achievers, Front Runners, and Performers.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the SDG India Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The index indeed uses 113 indicators and a score of 100 signifies achievement of all 2030 targets.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the 2023-24 index is the fourth edition, not the third.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the index uses four categories: Achievers, Front Runners, Performers, and Aspirants.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following aspects of the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme:**

1.  The IDWH is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.
2.  The scheme includes support for protected areas and protection of wildlife outside protected areas.
3. Project Tiger is not a sub-scheme under IDWH.
4. The IDWH has a species recovery program that has identified over 50 species.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect features of the IDWH scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 is correct. The IDWH scheme does support protected areas and wildlife outside them.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; IDWH falls under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Statement 3 is incorrect; Project Tiger is a sub-scheme under IDWH. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the species recovery program has identified 22 species, not over 50.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following about the People's Biodiversity Register (PBR):**

1.  PBRs are mandated by the Biological Diversity Act (2002) and prepared by the State Biodiversity Boards.
2. The primary purpose of a PBR is to document bioresources and associated traditional knowledge.
3. Information in PBRs includes the availability and knowledge of local biological resources and their medicinal uses.
4. PBRs primarily support the commercial exploitation of biodiversity resources.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the PBR?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. PBRs aim to document biodiversity and traditional knowledge, including medicinal uses of resources. However, statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the Biological Diversity Act mandates PBRs, they are prepared by Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs), not State Biodiversity Boards. Statement 4 is incorrect; PBRs support *sustainable* resource management and local ownership claims, not necessarily commercial exploitation.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the PBR's purpose and content.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024:**

1.  The EPI 2024 ranks countries based on 48 performance indicators.
2.  The EPI is published by the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy.
3.  India ranked among the top 50 countries in the EPI 2024.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The EPI is indeed published by the Yale Center and assesses the three specified areas.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the EPI uses 58 indicators, not 48. Statement 3 is also incorrect; India ranked 176th, not among the top 50.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the EPI 2024.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Fungi:**

1.  Fungi possess a cell wall composed of chitin.
2.  All fungi are multicellular organisms.
3.  Fungi exclusively obtain nutrition through parasitism.
4.  The IUCN Species Survival Commission Fungal Conservation Committee (FunCC) focuses on fungal conservation.
5.  Mycorrhizal associations are detrimental to plant growth.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Fungal cell walls are indeed primarily composed of chitin, a polysaccharide.  This distinguishes them from plant cells (cellulose) and animal cells (lacking a cell wall).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many fungi are multicellular, forming complex structures like mushrooms, some are unicellular, such as yeasts.  The diversity within the Kingdom Fungi encompasses both multicellular and unicellular forms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Fungi exhibit diverse nutritional strategies. While some are parasitic, obtaining nutrients from living organisms, others are saprophytic, decomposing dead organic matter, and some engage in mutualistic relationships, like mycorrhizae.  Heterotrophic is correct, but not exclusively parasitic.

Statement 4 is correct. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) plays a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, and the FunCC specifically addresses the conservation needs of fungal species, highlighting the growing recognition of their ecological importance.

Statement 5 is incorrect. Mycorrhizal associations are mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships between fungi and plant roots.  The fungi enhance the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, while the plant provides the fungi with carbohydrates.  This is crucial for the growth of many plants, especially trees.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.

1.  Bioplastics are produced solely from petroleum-based resources.
2.  They are always biodegradable under all conditions.
3.  They can be derived from renewable resources such as carbohydrates.
4.  They have a lower carbon footprint compared to conventional plastics.
5.  Bioplastics are always compostable in home composting systems.


How many of the above statements correctly describe bioplastics?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bioplastics can be produced from renewable resources, such as vegetable oils, and carbohydrates, but not solely from petroleum-based resources.  The "bio" in bioplastics signifies their biological origin, at least in part.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Biodegradability varies greatly among bioplastics.  While some are readily biodegradable under specific conditions (e.g., industrial composting), others require specific environments or may not be fully biodegradable.

Statement 3 is correct.  A significant advantage of bioplastics is their potential to be derived from renewable resources, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

Statement 4 is correct.  Generally, bioplastics have a lower carbon footprint than conventional plastics throughout their lifecycle, from production to disposal, although this depends on factors like the specific bioplastic and its production method.

Statement 5 is incorrect.  Compostability varies depending on the specific bioplastic and the composting conditions.  Many bioplastics require industrial composting facilities, not home composting systems.


**6. Consider the following concerning the Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD):**

1.  The CCD is the depth where calcium carbonate precipitation exceeds dissolution.
2.  It's primarily influenced by pressure, temperature, and dissolved CO2 levels.
3.  The CCD is consistently at a depth of approximately 4,000 meters.
4.  Plankton shells contribute to calcium carbonate supply in deep-ocean sediments.
5.  Increasing ocean acidification is likely to decrease the CCD depth.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the CCD?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCD is the depth where the rate of calcium carbonate supply from the surface equals the rate of dissolution in the deep ocean.  It's a balance point, not a point where precipitation exceeds dissolution.

Statement 2 is correct.  Pressure, temperature, and the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the ocean water are major factors affecting the rate of calcium carbonate dissolution, thus influencing the CCD depth.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the CCD is often around 4,000 meters, it's not a fixed value. It varies geographically and is susceptible to changes in ocean chemistry.

Statement 4 is correct.  The shells of marine plankton, which are often composed of calcium carbonate, are a primary source of calcium carbonate in deep-ocean sediments.  When they die, their shells sink.

Statement 5 is incorrect. Increasing ocean acidification (higher dissolved CO2) is likely to *increase* the CCD depth, because increased acidity leads to faster dissolution of calcium carbonate.  The CCD would shift to shallower depths.


**7. Consider the following regarding Aerobiology:**

1.  Aerobiology studies only pollen grains and their impact.
2.  Bioaerosols reflect changes in biodiversity sensitive to climate change.
3.  Real-time bioaerosol monitoring is a recent advancement.
4.  Aerobiology is solely concerned with human health impacts.
5.  Fungal spores are not considered bioaerosols.


How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of Aerobiology?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aerobiology has a much broader scope than just pollen; it encompasses various airborne biological particles such as bacteria, fungal spores, viruses, and other organic matter.

Statement 2 is correct. The composition and distribution of bioaerosols are highly sensitive to environmental changes, including climate shifts, reflecting changes in biodiversity and plant life.

Statement 3 is correct.  Advances in technology have enabled real-time monitoring of bioaerosols, providing more accurate and timely data on their distribution and potential impacts.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While human health is a significant area of concern in aerobiology, it also considers the impacts on animal and plant health, and the broader ecological implications of airborne biological particles.

Statement 5 is incorrect. Fungal spores are a significant component of bioaerosols and are studied extensively in aerobiology due to their potential allergenic and pathogenic effects.


**8. Consider the following regarding Gas Flaring:**

1.  Gas flaring is the process of capturing and utilizing natural gas.
2.  It is primarily done for environmental protection.
3.  It contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.
4.  Logistical challenges in transporting gas from remote oil fields are a reason for flaring.
5.  Gas flaring is completely banned globally.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding gas flaring?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gas flaring is the *burning* of natural gas, not its capture and utilization.  Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies are a separate approach to managing natural gas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Gas flaring is primarily done due to safety concerns (managing pressure in oil extraction) or economic factors (the cost of transporting gas from remote locations outweighs the value of the gas).  It is not done for environmental protection.

Statement 3 is correct.  Gas flaring releases significant amounts of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.

Statement 4 is correct.  The remoteness and inaccessibility of many oil fields make the transportation of natural gas challenging and expensive, leading to flaring as a cheaper (but environmentally damaging) alternative.

Statement 5 is incorrect.  While there are efforts to reduce gas flaring globally, it is not completely banned everywhere.  Many areas still practice gas flaring due to the factors mentioned above.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Bombay Natural History Society

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Bustard Recovery Project, aimed at conserving the Lesser Florican, explicitly mentions collaboration with the Bombay Natural History Society, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation, and The Corbett Foundation.  The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change is also a partner agency, actively involved in the project's implementation and oversight. Therefore, all four entities listed are involved in the project's collaborative efforts. The inclusion of seemingly disparate organizations highlights the multifaceted nature of conservation projects, requiring expertise from various sectors.  The question tests the ability to recall specific participating organizations, demonstrating knowledge of the collaborative structure of environmental conservation initiatives.


**2. Consider the following statements related to the Supreme Court order on banning power lines:**

1.  The order imposed a complete ban on all overhead transmission lines in specified regions.
2.  An Expert Committee was formed to assess the feasibility of undergrounding power lines.
3.  The order aimed to protect biodiversity in ecologically sensitive areas.
4.  The order was solely focused on high-voltage power lines.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's decision?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court modified its earlier order, indicating that it did *not* impose a complete ban on all overhead transmission lines (statement 1 is incorrect).  The court did, however, establish an Expert Committee to evaluate the feasibility and extent of both overhead and underground lines (statement 2 is correct). The order's broader aim was likely to balance energy infrastructure development with environmental protection, implicitly including biodiversity concerns (statement 3 is plausible and indirectly supported).  The order was not solely focused on high-voltage lines (statement 4 is incorrect, as it involved both high and low-voltage lines).  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) accurately depict the Supreme Court's decision. The question tests the ability to differentiate between the nuances of the Supreme Court ruling and common misconceptions about environmental regulations.

How many of the above statements correctly link organizations to their areas of focus?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The WMO's focus is broader than just air quality; it encompasses weather, climate, and related environmental issues (statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplified). UNEP is deeply involved in climate change (statement 2 is correct). The International Cryosphere Climate Initiative is indeed concerned with glaciers and cryosphere-related issues (statement 3 is correct).  The CCAC focuses on short-lived climate pollutants and air quality, not primarily water pollution (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, three statements (2 and 3) correctly link organizations to their primary areas of focus.  This question tests knowledge of key international environmental organizations and their mandates, requiring accurate recall of their specific roles and responsibilities.



1. Consider the following statements regarding microplastics:

1. Primary microplastics are intentionally manufactured tiny particles used in various commercial applications.
2. Secondary microplastics originate from the disintegration of larger plastic items.
3. Microplastic ingestion by marine organisms disrupts the food chain and poses toxicity risks.
4. Human exposure to microplastics is linked solely to gastrointestinal issues.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of microplastics. Primary microplastics, such as microbeads in cosmetics or microfibers from textiles, are deliberately produced for commercial use. Secondary microplastics result from the breakdown of larger plastic debris in the environment.  The ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms is a significant environmental concern, leading to bioaccumulation of toxins and disruption of the entire food web.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While gastrointestinal issues are a potential consequence of microplastic ingestion, human exposure is linked to a broader range of health problems, including endocrine disruption, respiratory problems, and potential impacts on other organ systems.  Studies have even detected microplastics in human blood, lungs, breast milk, placentas, and testes, indicating systemic effects beyond the gastrointestinal tract.


2. Consider the following concerning the Carbonate Compensation Depth (CCD):

1. CCD represents the ocean depth where calcium carbonate supply equals its dissolution rate.
2.  Deep-sea calcium carbonate sediments primarily originate from decaying surface plankton.
3. Increasing pressure, temperature, and dissolved CO2 at greater depths enhance carbonate dissolution.
4. The CCD is a static phenomenon, unaffected by environmental changes.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the CCD.  The CCD marks the depth where the rate of calcium carbonate input from surface waters (largely from the shells and tests of marine organisms) balances the rate at which it dissolves in the deeper, more acidic waters.  The calcium carbonate shells of surface plankton are a major source of this sediment.  Increased pressure, lower temperatures, and higher dissolved CO2 concentrations at greater depths all contribute to the increased dissolution of calcium carbonate. Statement 4 is false.  The CCD is dynamic and is influenced by various factors, including ocean acidification (driven by increased atmospheric CO2), changes in ocean circulation, and variations in the productivity of surface plankton.  Current research indicates that the CCD is expanding due to ocean acidification, which is a significant environmental concern.


3. Consider the following regarding the "Grasshopper Effect":

1. The grasshopper effect describes the atmospheric transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).
2. POPs primarily accumulate in low-latitude regions due to their high persistence.
3.  The Arctic acts as a "hemispheric sink" for POPs transported via atmospheric and oceanic currents.
4.  The grasshopper effect is primarily a phenomenon limited to plastic pollutants.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The grasshopper effect (also known as global distillation) describes the long-range atmospheric transport of semi-volatile organic pollutants, including POPs, from lower latitudes to higher latitudes, like the Arctic.  The Arctic accumulates these pollutants because they are deposited from the atmosphere and are persistent, meaning they don't readily break down.  Therefore, the Arctic acts as a sink for these pollutants.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. POPs don't primarily accumulate in low-latitude regions; rather, they are transported *from* these regions to higher latitudes via the grasshopper effect, accumulating in polar regions due to their persistence and the atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns.  The grasshopper effect applies to various persistent pollutants, including but not limited to plastics.


4. Consider the following statements about Mercury Pollution:

1. Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in various environmental compartments.
2.  The Minamata Convention aims to completely eliminate all mercury use globally.
3.  Methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury, bioaccumulates in aquatic food chains.
4.  The UNEP's initiative focuses solely on phasing out mercury in industrial settings.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Mercury is naturally present in the environment, but anthropogenic activities significantly increase its levels. Methylmercury is a particularly dangerous form of mercury that biomagnifies in aquatic food chains, posing significant risks to human health.  The UNEP's initiative, mentioned in the text, targets mercury use in healthcare.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Minamata Convention on Mercury aims to significantly reduce and control mercury use, but it doesn't aim for a complete global elimination of all mercury use.  Some essential applications might still be permitted under strict controls.


5. Consider the following concerning Glacial Lakes and GLOFs:

1. Glacial lakes are freshwater sources in Himalayan regions but pose GLOF risks.
2.  Moraine-dammed lakes are formed when water is impounded by glacial debris.
3. GLOFs are characterized by gradual water release over extended periods.
4.  The Central Water Commission (CWC) manages both surface and groundwater resources.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Glacial lakes are vital freshwater sources, but their formation behind unstable moraine dams creates the risk of GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods).  Moraine-dammed lakes are specifically those where the water is held back by a moraine (a mass of rocks and sediment deposited by a glacier).  However, statement 3 is incorrect. GLOFs are characterized by *sudden* and rapid releases of water, typically lasting hours to days, not gradual releases.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. The CWC primarily deals with surface water resources; groundwater management falls under the purview of the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB).


6. Consider the following regarding Bioplastics:

1. Bioplastics are polymers derived entirely from petroleum-based sources.
2. They are exclusively biodegradable in all environments.
3.  Bioplastics offer a low-carbon footprint alternative to conventional plastics.
4.  Microbial decomposition of bioplastics produces only water and carbon dioxide.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  Bioplastics are produced from renewable resources (like carbohydrates and vegetable oils) and can have a lower carbon footprint compared to conventional plastics derived from fossil fuels.   Microbial decomposition of bioplastics generally leads to CO2, water and biomass, although the exact byproducts depend on the specific type of bioplastic and the microbial community involved.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. Bioplastics are derived from renewable biomass sources, not solely petroleum.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Biodegradability of bioplastics varies depending on the specific type of bioplastic and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, oxygen availability, presence of specific microorganisms).  Some bioplastics may require industrial composting facilities to properly degrade.


7. Consider the following about Soil Acidification:

1. Soil acidification leads to increased soil inorganic carbon (SIC) content.
2.  Liming is a common method for managing acid soils.
3.  Acid-tolerant crops, such as sugarcane and bananas, can be cultivated in acid soils.
4.  Soil acidification enhances microbial activity and nutrient availability.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Liming (adding lime or other alkaline materials) is a widely used technique to raise the pH of acidic soils, improving their suitability for agriculture.  Certain crops exhibit greater tolerance to acidic conditions, and sugarcane and bananas are examples of such acid-tolerant species.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. Soil acidification leads to a *decrease* in soil inorganic carbon (SIC) content.  Statement 4 is also incorrect.  Soil acidification generally *reduces* microbial activity and nutrient availability, leading to decreased soil fertility.  The increase in aluminum toxicity, often associated with acidification, further inhibits microbial function.


8. Consider the following statements regarding Aquatic Deoxygenation (AD):

1. AD refers to an overall increase in oxygen levels in aquatic environments.
2.  Global warming reduces oxygen solubility in water, contributing to AD.
3.  Eutrophication, caused by nutrient runoff, exacerbates AD.
4.  AD primarily impacts freshwater ecosystems and has minimal effects on marine environments.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Global warming increases water temperatures, which lowers the solubility of oxygen in water, leading to lower oxygen levels.  Eutrophication, the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients (often from agricultural runoff), stimulates algal blooms. When these algae die and decompose, the process consumes substantial amounts of dissolved oxygen, creating hypoxic or anoxic zones (dead zones).  However, statement 1 is incorrect. AD refers to a *decrease* in oxygen levels. Statement 4 is also incorrect.  AD impacts both freshwater and marine ecosystems, with significant consequences for marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.  The expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the oceans is a major concern.


9. Consider the following regarding Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs):

1. POPs break down rapidly in the environment.
2. The Stockholm Convention aims to completely eliminate all POPs globally.
3.  POPs can persist for extended periods in both the environment and living organisms.
4.  Exposure to POPs has been linked to various health issues.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. POPs are characterized by their persistence in the environment and their tendency to accumulate in living organisms (bioaccumulation).  Exposure to POPs has been linked to various adverse health effects, including cancer, reproductive problems, and developmental disorders.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. POPs are defined by their persistence; they do not break down easily.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants aims to regulate and reduce the production and use of POPs, but it doesn't aim for their complete global elimination, as some essential uses might be permitted under strict controls.


10. Consider the following about Megafauna:

1. Megafauna are defined as animals weighing less than 50 kg.
2.  Megafauna are classified solely based on their habitat.
3.  Anthropogenic pressures have led to significant losses of megafauna.
4.  Extinct megafaunal species include woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  Human activities have significantly impacted megafauna populations, resulting in extinctions and population declines.  Woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed cats are well-known examples of extinct megafauna.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. Megafauna are defined as animals exceeding a certain weight threshold (generally above 50 kg).  Statement 2 is also incorrect. Megafauna are classified based on their dietary habits (megaherbivores, megacarnivores, megaomnivores), not solely on their habitat.  Although habitat loss is a major threat to megafauna, their classification is primarily based on their ecological role and body size.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Bustard Recovery Project:**

1. It was initiated in 2013 and renamed in 2016.
2. The Wildlife Institute of India implements the project.
3. The project's primary focus is habitat restoration in Rajasthan.

5. The project's funding is solely provided by the Rajasthan government.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bustard Recovery Project, initially launched in 2013, was renamed in 2016, making statement 1 correct.  The Wildlife Institute of India is indeed the implementing agency (statement 2). The project's scope extends beyond Rajasthan, encompassing Gujarat and Maharashtra, making statement 3 incorrect. The Bombay Natural History Society is listed as a collaborating agency, validating statement 4. Finally, statement 5 is false; the funding comes from the National Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), not solely the Rajasthan government.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Lesser Florican ( *Sypheotides indicus*):**

1. It belongs to the pheasant family.
2. Its conservation status is listed as "Least Concern".
3.  It is primarily found in the Western Ghats.
4.  Pesticide use in agricultural lands is a significant threat.
5. It is the largest bird of the bustard family.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Lesser Florican belongs to the bustard family (Otididae), not the pheasant family, making statement 1 incorrect. Its conservation status is not "Least Concern,"  but rather it faces significant threats, rendering statement 2 false.  Its habitat is not limited to the Western Ghats; it's found across several states in India, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh, making statement 3 incorrect.  Pesticide use in its breeding grounds is a major threat, making statement 4 correct. Finally, the Lesser Florican is the smallest, not the largest, bird of the bustard family, making statement 5 incorrect. Therefore, only one statement (4) is correct.

5.  The order was completely overturned.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court modified its earlier order, not mandating the complete undergrounding of all power lines, making statement 1 incorrect.  The court did, however, constitute an expert committee to assess the feasibility of undergrounding, making statement 2 correct. While avian mortality is a likely concern that influenced the order, it is not explicitly stated, so statement 3 is less certain and likely incorrect. The order applies to both high and low-voltage lines, making statement 4 incorrect. Finally, the order was modified, not completely overturned, making statement 5 incorrect. Thus, only two statements (2) are definitively correct.  The others either lack sufficient evidence or are factually incorrect based on the provided text.

1.  It was established during the fourth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM4).
2.  It primarily supports high-income countries in managing chemicals and waste.
3.  Its objectives include strengthening national capacities in managing chemicals and waste.
4.  The Executive Board comprises representatives from all UN regions and donor countries.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GFC Fund was set up during the fifth International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM5), not the fourth.  This is a crucial detail regarding its establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GFC Fund specifically targets low- and middle-income countries, including small island developing states, to address the challenges of chemical and waste management.  High-income countries are not the primary focus of its funding.

Statement 3 is correct. A key objective of the GFC Fund is to build the capacity of nations to manage chemicals and waste effectively, aligning with international standards.

Statement 4 is correct. The Executive Board's composition includes national representatives from all UN regions and representatives from donor countries, ensuring broad representation in decision-making.  Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are accurate.


**6. Consider the following international agreements or initiatives related to e-waste management:**

1.  The Stockholm Convention
2.  The Basel Convention
3.  The Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP)
4.  The R2 Code of Practices

How many of the above are directly involved in addressing the global challenge of e-waste management?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the Stockholm Convention focuses on persistent organic pollutants (POPs),  the Basel Convention is explicitly designed to control the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, including e-waste. The Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP) is a collaborative effort that focuses on data collection and analysis related to e-waste, providing crucial information for management strategies. The R2 Code of Practices provides a framework for environmentally sound electronics recycling practices. Therefore, all four are directly involved in addressing the global challenge of e-waste management, albeit in different ways.

2.  It primarily focuses on urban land use changes.
3.  It shows an increase in built-up land since 2005.
4.  It indicates a consistent decline in shifting cultivation since 2005.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Annual LULC Atlas of India is published by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), not ISRO.  While NRSC is part of ISRO, the publishing body is specifically the NRSC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Atlas does include data on urban areas, its scope is broader, encompassing agricultural land, forests, and other land cover types.  It provides a comprehensive overview of land use patterns across India.

Statement 3 is correct. The Atlas shows a significant increase in built-up land area since 2005, reflecting urbanization trends.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Atlas shows an increase in shifting cultivation until 2016-17, followed by a decline.  It's not a consistent decline throughout the period since 2005.  Therefore, only statements 3 is entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following sources of funding for the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB):**

1.  Environment Protection Charge (EPC)
2.  Funds received as per orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT)
3.  Funds allocated directly by the Ministry of Finance
4.  Environmental compensation levied under the Polluter Pays Principle

How many of the above are sources of funding for the CPCB?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Environment Protection Charge (EPC) is a specific levy contributing to the CPCB's funding.  Funds from the NGT are received as compensation for environmental damage or non-compliance, forming a significant source of funding for the CPCB.  While not directly allocated by the Ministry of Finance in a single lump sum, the CPCB's budget is ultimately a part of the government's overall spending and therefore indirectly receives funding from the Ministry of Finance. Environmental compensation, based on the "Polluter Pays Principle," is a key source of revenue for the CPCB, ensuring that polluters contribute to environmental remediation efforts. Therefore, all four options are valid sources of funding for the CPCB.


**9. Consider the following about the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):**

4. They only involve economy-wide annual levels of GHG emissions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NDCs are submitted under the Paris Agreement, not the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol had a different mechanism for commitments.

Statement 2 is correct. NDCs can include targets for both GHG emissions and other relevant non-GHG metrics, such as renewable energy capacity or forest cover.

Statement 3 is incorrect. NDCs can include both mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (adjusting to climate change impacts) measures.  They are not solely focused on mitigation.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While economy-wide annual GHG emissions are a common component, NDCs can include other metrics and targets related to different sectors or aspects of climate action.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

1. GLOFs are sudden releases of water from glacial lakes, often occurring cyclically.
2.  Moraine dam instability, a geological factor, is a significant contributor to GLOFs.
3. Excessive precipitation is a primary cause of GLOFs, irrespective of other factors.
4. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction addresses cross-border GLOF risks.
5.  The National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS) focuses solely on Uttarakhand's glacial lakes.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GLOFs are characterized by sudden and sometimes cyclical releases of water from glacial lakes.  The events are rapid, lasting from hours to days, and result in significant downstream river discharges.

Statement 2 is correct.  Moraine dam instability is a key geological factor contributing to GLOFs. Loose and unconsolidated moraines are inherently unstable and can collapse due to structural weakness, leading to a catastrophic release of water.  The South Lhonak GLOF in Sikkim serves as a prime example.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While excessive precipitation can contribute to GLOFs by increasing water levels in glacial lakes, it is not the *primary* cause. Other factors, such as geological instability (moraine dam failures, earthquakes), morphological changes (mass movements into lakes), and physical processes (cryoseisms, glacial surging), also play crucial roles.  It's a contributing factor, not the sole cause.

Statement 4 is correct. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction encourages international cooperation to manage transboundary risks, including those posed by GLOFs which can impact multiple countries downstream.

Statement 5 is incorrect. While the NMHS does address glacial lake issues in the Sikkim Himalayas (as evidenced by studies conducted by the National Institute of Hydrology), its scope is not limited to Uttarakhand.  It encompasses a broader study of the Himalayan region.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), referenced in relation to the High Seas Treaty, defines the territorial sea as extending up to 12 nautical miles from the baseline. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) extends to 200 nautical miles.

Statement 2 is correct. The High Seas Treaty recognizes the high seas as global commons, areas belonging to no single nation but subject to shared responsibility for conservation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ministry of Earth Sciences in India is designated to spearhead the implementation of the High Seas Treaty within the country.

Statement 4 is correct. The treaty was adopted in 2023 and is open for signature, meaning it is not yet fully in force, requiring ratification by a sufficient number of countries.

Statement 5 is incorrect. While the conservation and management of marine biodiversity is a key objective of the BBNJ Agreement, it's not solely focused on migratory fish stocks. It addresses a much broader range of marine life and ecosystems beyond national jurisdictions.  The UN Fish Stocks Agreement deals specifically with migratory fish.

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC falls under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, not the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CWC's headquarters are located in New Delhi, not Mumbai.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CWC deals primarily with surface water resources; groundwater management falls under the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB).

Statement 4 is correct. The CWC is involved in reviewing the design flood of dams vulnerable to GLOFs, a crucial aspect of disaster risk reduction.

Statement 5 is correct. A key aim of the CWC is to promote integrated and sustainable development and management of India's water resources.  This includes consideration of environmental sustainability.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs):**

1. GLOFs are sudden releases of water from glacial lakes, often lasting hours to days.
2.  Moraine dam instability, a geological factor, is a significant contributor to GLOFs.
3.  Excessive precipitation and cryoseisms are among the physical factors causing GLOFs.
4.  The Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) plays a crucial role in GLOF risk assessment.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of GLOFs.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the sudden and relatively short duration of these events. Statement 2 accurately points out moraine dam instability as a key geological factor, highlighting the inherent instability of unconsolidated moraines. Statement 3 correctly cites excessive precipitation and cryoseisms (non-tectonic seismic events within the cryosphere) as contributing physical factors.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Central Water Commission (CWC), not the CGWB, is primarily involved in GLOF risk assessment and dam safety reviews.  The CWC deals with surface water, while the CGWB focuses on groundwater. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the management of GLOFs in India:**

1. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued specific guidelines for GLOF management.
2.  The design flood of dams vulnerable to GLOFs is reviewed by the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB).
3.  GLOF studies are mandatory for all new dams planned in areas with glacial lakes in their catchments.
4.  The National Mission on Himalayan Studies (NMHS) exclusively focuses on GLOF risk mitigation.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives taken in India for GLOFs management?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect Indian initiatives. The NDMA has indeed published guidelines for GLOF management, providing a framework for preparedness and response.  GLOF studies are now mandated for new dams situated in catchments containing glacial lakes. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Central Water Commission (CWC), not the CGWB, reviews dam design floods.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the NMHS contributes to understanding Himalayan glacial lakes, it's not solely focused on GLOF mitigation.  It encompasses broader Himalayan studies. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements related to the expansion of glacial lakes in the Himalayas:**

1.  The expansion of glacial lakes in India has been approximately 33.7% between 2011 and 2024.
2.  Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh have witnessed the most significant expansion of glacial lakes.
3.  Sixty-seven lakes identified as high-risk for GLOFs experienced less than a 40% increase in surface area.
4.  The Central Water Commission (CWC) attributes the expansion solely to increased glacial melt due to climate change.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The CWC report indicated a significant increase in the area of glacial lakes, and the mentioned states experienced notable expansion.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the report actually states that 67 high-risk lakes experienced *over* a 40% increase.  Statement 4 is also incorrect because while climate change is a major factor, the CWC report likely considered multiple contributing factors for the expansion of glacial lakes, not solely glacial melt.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following concerning the Kallakkadal phenomenon:**

1. Kallakkadal is a coastal flooding event primarily occurring during the monsoon season.
2.  It is caused by swell waves generated by distant weather systems, such as hurricanes.
3.  Swell waves associated with Kallakkadal always propagate in the same direction as the local wind.
4.  Kallakkadal is a phenomenon exclusive to the east coast of India.

Which of the above statements correctly describe Kallakkadal?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is accurate. Kallakkadal is indeed caused by swell waves originating from distant weather systems.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Kallakkadal typically occurs in the pre-monsoon or post-monsoon seasons, not during the monsoon itself. Statement 3 is false; swell waves can propagate independently of local wind direction. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Kallakkadal affects the southwest coast of India, not the east coast.  Therefore, only statement 2 provides a correct description of the phenomenon.


**5. Consider the following about the  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale:**

1. The scale categorizes tropical cyclones into five categories based on wind speed.
2.  Category 5 represents the strongest and most destructive cyclones.
3.  The scale is used exclusively for hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.
4.  A recent Category 5 super typhoon, according to the scale, struck Southern China (Hainan Island) and Southeast Asia.

How many of the above statements about the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Saffir-Simpson scale uses wind speed to categorize tropical cyclones into five categories, with Category 5 representing the most intense.  A recent Category 5 super typhoon did indeed affect Southern China and Southeast Asia.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while primarily used for Atlantic hurricanes, the Saffir-Simpson scale's principles are applicable to similar intense tropical cyclones worldwide.

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 3 are correct. The elevation of the Western Ghats increases from north to south, making statement 1 incorrect. While evergreen forests are present, the Western Ghats also contain semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, and dry deciduous forests, making statement 2 an oversimplification.  The presence of iron, manganese, and bauxite ores is a well-known characteristic. The Palghat Gap and Thal and Bhor ghats are indeed significant passes. This question assesses knowledge of the geographical features, biodiversity, and mineral resources of the Western Ghats.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the region's geology and ecology.


**9. Consider the following about the Kasturirangan Committee report on the Western Ghats:**

1.  The report recommended designating less than 10% of the Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).
2.  The report proposed a uniform level of sensitivity across the entire Western Ghats region.
3.  The report recommended color-coding industries based on their environmental impact.
4.  The report suggested extending Entry 20 (Economic Planning) of the concurrent list to regulate development within an ecological framework.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 4 and 4 are correct. The Kasturirangan Committee recommended designating approximately 37% (not less than 10%), of the Western Ghats as an ESA, making statement 1 incorrect. The report proposed different levels of sensitivity (ESZ1, ESZ2, ESZ3), not a uniform level, refuting statement 2. The color-coding of industries was a recommendation of the High-Level Working Group (HLWG), not the Kasturirangan Committee, making statement 3 incorrect. The suggestion to extend Entry 20 of the concurrent list was indeed part of the Kasturirangan Committee's recommendations. This question tests knowledge of the Kasturirangan Committee report's specific recommendations for the Western Ghats.  The inclusion of distractors related to other committees and proposals makes this a demanding question.

How many of the above statements accurately describe microplastics and their impacts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate representations of microplastics and their effects. Primary microplastics, such as microbeads in cosmetics or microfibers from clothing, are intentionally manufactured at a small size. Secondary microplastics result from the degradation of larger plastics in the environment.  The ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms leads to bioaccumulation and biomagnification, disrupting the food chain and ultimately impacting human health through consumption of contaminated seafood.  Scientific studies have indeed detected microplastics in human blood, lungs, breast milk, and other tissues, raising significant concerns about potential health risks. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the statements.


2. Consider the following regarding Gape Limitation in ecology:

1. It refers to the physical constraint on the size of prey a predator can consume.
2. It is primarily determined by the predator's body size.
3. Gape limitation significantly influences predator-prey relationships.
4. It is irrelevant to the study of food webs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the concept of Gape Limitation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately depict Gape Limitation.  It's a fundamental ecological concept where a predator's mouth size (gape) directly limits the maximum size of prey it can successfully capture and consume. While body size is a major factor, it's not the *only* determinant; jaw structure and hunting techniques also play roles.  Gape limitation significantly shapes food webs, influencing species interactions, prey selection, and the overall structure of the ecosystem.  Statement 4 is incorrect; gape limitation is a crucial factor in understanding food web dynamics and energy flow.


3. Consider the following regarding the characteristics of Fungi:

1. Fungi exclusively reproduce through spores.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Great Oxygenation Event?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is correct. Stromatolites, microbial mats, were significant oxygen producers in early Earth's oceans, contributing substantially to the rise in atmospheric oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event.  The event dramatically *increased*, not reduced, atmospheric oxygen levels, significantly altering Earth's atmosphere and paving the way for the evolution of aerobic life.  The event had a profound impact on life's evolution, leading to the extinction of many anaerobic organisms and the rise of oxygen-dependent life forms.  The event involved the release of oxygen, not carbon dioxide, as a byproduct of photosynthesis.


5. Consider the following regarding environmental DNA (eDNA):

1. eDNA is exclusively found in aquatic environments.
2. eDNA analysis is expensive and unreliable.
3. eDNA analysis can be used to assess biodiversity.

4. Megafauna exclusively refers to extant species.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of megafauna?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 3 is accurate. While weight is a primary criterion for defining megafauna (generally >50 kg), other factors are also considered.  Classifications are based on diet (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores) and not solely on habitat.  Anthropogenic pressures, such as habitat loss and hunting, have caused dramatic declines in many megafauna populations. Statement 4 is incorrect because megafauna includes both extant and extinct species.  The question uses misleading information to create difficulty.


7. Consider the following about Plankton crashes:

1. Plankton crashes are always caused by a lack of nutrients.
2. Plankton crashes can occur due to changes in water quality.
3. Plankton crashes are a natural and regular phenomenon.
4. Plankton crashes have no impact on marine ecosystems.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the causes and consequences of plankton crashes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 is correct. A sudden change in water quality (e.g., pollution, temperature fluctuations) can cause a plankton crash. While nutrient deficiency is a frequent cause, it's not the only one. Plankton crashes are not necessarily regular, and their impact on marine ecosystems can be substantial, affecting the entire food web.  Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.  The inclusion of seemingly plausible distractors increases the difficulty.


8. Consider the following regarding Bioluminescence:

1. Bioluminescence is found only in marine organisms.
2. Bioluminescence requires luciferin and luciferase.
3. Bioluminescence always emits blue light.
4. Bioluminescence serves only as a defense mechanism.

How many of the above statements accurately describe bioluminescence?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 2 is correct.  Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms and is found in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic species, including fireflies, fungi, and various marine organisms.  The process typically involves luciferin (a light-emitting substrate) and luciferase (an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction).  The light emitted varies in color, not solely blue.  While defense is a common function, bioluminescence also serves other purposes, such as attracting prey or mates. The distractors aim to confuse the candidate with partially true statements.


9.  Consider the following regarding the IUCN Red List:

1. The IUCN Red List categorizes only animal species.
2. The IUCN Red List is updated annually.
3. The IUCN Red List provides information on species extinction risk.
4. The IUCN Red List is solely based on population size.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 3 is correct. The IUCN Red List assesses the extinction risk of both animal and plant species, including fungi. While the list is updated regularly, it's not necessarily done annually; updates occur as new data become available.  Extinction risk is determined by various factors beyond just population size, including habitat loss, threats, and population trends.  The other options include misleading information to increase the difficulty level of the question.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a revolutionary tool in biodiversity assessment. Statement 1 is incorrect; eDNA analysis is applicable to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Statement 2 is false; eDNA offers a reliable, accurate, and cost-effective alternative to conventional methods.  Statement 3 is correct; eDNA data can significantly contribute to updating the IUCN Red List and other conservation initiatives. Statement 4 is also correct as eDNA analysis is based on detecting DNA shed by organisms into their surroundings. Consequently, statements 3 and 4, along with the understanding of the limitations of other options, are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding speciation:**

1.  Sympatric speciation requires geographic isolation.
2.  Allopatric speciation involves geographically separated populations.
3.  Peripatric speciation occurs when a large population is isolated.
4.  Parapatric speciation happens within a continuously distributed population.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Speciation is the evolutionary process by which new biological species arise. Statement 1 is incorrect; sympatric speciation occurs *without* geographic isolation, unlike other modes. Statement 2 is correct; allopatric speciation involves the geographic separation of populations, leading to independent evolution and eventual speciation. Statement 3 is incorrect; peripatric speciation involves the isolation of a *small* population at the edge of a larger one. Statement 4 is correct; parapatric speciation occurs within a continuously distributed population, but with partial isolation due to environmental gradients or other factors. Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are accurate.


**6. Consider the following about Bioluminescence:**

1.  Bioluminescence is the emission of light by living organisms.
