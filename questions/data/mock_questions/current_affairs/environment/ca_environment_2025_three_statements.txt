3.  Implementation of the NRP occurs through national restoration plans developed and executed by individual EU member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRP aims to recover at least 20% of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050, not 30% by 2040.  The 20% target is a crucial component of the European Green Deal's biodiversity strategy.  Confusing the percentage or timeframe demonstrates a lack of precise understanding of the NRP's ambitious goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRP explicitly includes marine ecosystems alongside terrestrial ones, demonstrating a holistic approach to nature restoration across the EU's diverse environments.  The omission of marine ecosystems in the statement is a significant factual error.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NRP's implementation relies heavily on the individual member states of the EU creating and enacting their own National Restoration Plans. This decentralized approach allows for tailoring strategies to specific regional contexts while maintaining a unified continental objective.  This reflects the EU's governance structure, where significant policy implementation is delegated to member states.


**2. With reference to the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), consider the following statements:**

1. The EUDR applies only to products imported into the EU, excluding domestically produced goods.
2.  The regulation requires companies to verify the origin of a limited range of products, primarily focusing on palm oil and soy.
3. The EUDR aims to prevent deforestation and forest degradation globally, not just within the EU.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EUDR applies to a wide range of products placed on the EU market, regardless of whether they are domestically produced or imported. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure that the EU's internal market does not contribute to deforestation elsewhere in the world.  Restricting the regulation to imports would significantly weaken its impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While palm oil and soy are included, the EUDR covers a much broader range of products, including beef, cocoa, and timber. This comprehensive list reflects the diverse range of commodities linked to deforestation globally.  Underestimating the scope of the regulation shows an incomplete understanding of its reach.

Statement 3 is correct. The EUDR's goal is to prevent deforestation and forest degradation globally by ensuring that products placed on the EU market do not contribute to these environmental problems, regardless of their origin. This proactive measure aims to influence global supply chains and promote sustainable practices internationally. The global reach of this regulation highlights the EU's commitment to international environmental cooperation.


**3.  With reference to Biocovers, consider the following statements:**

2.  Methanotrophic bacteria within the biocover convert methane into carbon dioxide and water.
3. Biocovers are primarily used for remediating fugitive methane emissions from recently constructed landfills.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Biocovers consist of multiple layers; a porous material layer is placed directly on the landfill, and *then* covered by an oxidizing layer of mature compost. This layered design optimizes conditions for methanotrophic bacteria.  The simplification of the layering process in statement 1 misrepresents a key aspect of biocover technology.

Statement 2 is correct. Methanotrophic bacteria are the core of the biocover system. These bacteria utilize methane as an energy source, converting it into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). This conversion process is the primary mechanism by which biocovers control methane emissions.  This statement accurately reflects the fundamental biological process at the heart of biocover technology.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While biocovers *can* be used for newer landfills, their main application is for the remediation of fugitive methane emissions from *old* dumpsites, where traditional methods may be less effective.  Focusing on new landfills misrepresents the primary target application for this technology. The statement incorrectly limits the application to recently constructed landfills, overlooking the crucial role in managing legacy waste sites.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Grasshopper Effect:**

1. The Grasshopper Effect primarily involves the transport of plastic and toxic chemicals from the Arctic to lower latitudes.
2.  The process is driven by atmospheric and oceanic currents, leading to the accumulation of pollutants in the Arctic.
3. The Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN) released a report solely focused on the effects of the Grasshopper Effect on marine ecosystems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Grasshopper Effect describes the transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and other chemicals from lower latitudes *to* the Arctic, not the other way around.  These pollutants are transported via atmospheric and oceanic currents, accumulating in the Arctic region due to its cold temperatures and atmospheric circulation patterns.  Reversing the direction of pollutant transport is a crucial error.

Statement 2 is correct. Atmospheric and oceanic currents are the primary drivers of the Grasshopper Effect. These currents carry pollutants over long distances, concentrating them in the Arctic, which acts as a "hemispheric sink." This accumulation of pollutants poses significant environmental and health risks.  This accurately describes the physical mechanisms behind the Grasshopper Effect.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the report by ACAT and IPEN addresses the Grasshopper Effect, it focuses on broader impacts, including human health, human rights, and Indigenous lands, not solely on marine ecosystems.  Oversimplifying the report's scope misrepresents the extent of its findings.  The statement incorrectly limits the report's focus to marine ecosystems, ignoring other crucial aspects.

2.  The Atlas shows a significant decrease in built-up land area since 2005.
3. The Atlas reveals an increase in double/triple cropping areas, indicating intensified agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Atlas actually shows an *expansion* of Kharif and Rabi cropland over the past 17 years, not a decrease. This expansion reflects changes in agricultural practices and land use patterns across India.  The reversal of this trend is a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atlas indicates an *increase* in built-up land area since 2005, reflecting urbanization and infrastructure development. This increase is a significant indicator of economic growth and population shifts in India.  The statement incorrectly suggests a decrease in built-up land.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Atlas does show a significant increase in double/triple cropping areas, indicating a rise in intensified agricultural practices. This intensification is a complex issue with both positive and negative environmental and economic consequences.  This statement accurately reflects a key finding of the Atlas.


**6.  With reference to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPCB is a non-statutory body established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
2.  The CPCB receives environmental compensation solely through the Environment Protection Charge (EPC).
3. The CPCB's primary function is to enforce environmental regulations and monitor pollution levels across India.

2. The SEEA framework, encompassing both SEEA-CF and SEEA-EA, provides a comprehensive description of the interactions between the economy and the environment, including the stocks and flows of environmental assets.
3.  EnviStats India 2024, compiled according to the SEEA framework, highlights India's leading role in energy transition but does not include data on ocean accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. SEEA-CF does indeed focus on measuring individual environmental resources and their use by the economy. However, it's inaccurate to say it *excludes* ecosystem services entirely. While SEEA-EA is specifically dedicated to ecosystem accounting, some aspects of resource utilization within SEEA-CF might indirectly relate to ecosystem services.  The statement oversimplifies the relationship between SEEA-CF and ecosystem services.

Statement 2 is correct. The SEEA framework, encompassing both the Central Framework (CF) and Ecosystem Accounting (EA), provides a holistic view of the economy-environment interaction.  It details how economic activities affect environmental assets and vice-versa, considering both the stocks (existing resources) and flows (changes in resources). This integrated approach is crucial for sustainable development policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While EnviStats India 2024 does highlight India's progress in energy transition,  the text explicitly mentions that the publication includes information on ocean accounts, alongside energy accounts, soil nutrient index, and biodiversity. Therefore, the statement's claim that ocean accounts are excluded is false.


**2. With reference to the Gross Environment Product Index (GEPI), consider the following statements:**

1. Uttarakhand is the first Indian state to implement GEPI, a method focusing solely on quantifying the economic contributions of natural ecosystems.
2. The GEPI formula involves a simple summation of individual indices for air, soil, trees, and water, without any weighting or normalization factors.
3. GEPI primarily aims to assess the impact of anthropogenic pressures on ecological development, offering a holistic evaluation beyond purely economic metrics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that Uttarakhand is indeed the first Indian state to launch a GEPI. However, it's inaccurate to state that GEPI focuses *solely* on quantifying economic contributions. While GEPI does quantify the economic value of ecosystem services, its broader aim is to assess ecological development impacted by human activities, going beyond a purely economic assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided description of the GEPI formula is a simplification.  While it involves adding individual indices for air, soil, trees, and water,  it is highly improbable that there are no weighting or normalization factors used in a sophisticated index like GEPI.  Such factors would be crucial to ensure a meaningful comparison across different components and regions.

Statement 3 is correct. GEPI's primary purpose is to evaluate the impact of human intervention on ecological development. It considers both economic and ecological aspects, providing a more comprehensive picture than simply focusing on economic contributions alone.  This holistic approach aligns with sustainable development goals.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-REDD report actually indicates that only a *minority* (8 out of 20) of the top deforestation countries have included quantified forest targets in their NDCs. This highlights a significant gap in global climate action concerning forests.

Statement 2 is correct. The report strongly emphasizes that while afforestation and reforestation are important, reducing deforestation is the most crucial immediate step for climate change mitigation.  Deforestation releases significant amounts of stored carbon, making its reduction a priority over simply planting new trees.

Statement 3 is incorrect. UN-REDD is a knowledge and advisory program. While it might indirectly support financial mechanisms, its primary role is not direct financial assistance. It focuses on providing knowledge, guidance, and support to countries in developing and implementing policies and strategies for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.


**4. With reference to the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA), consider the following statements:**

1. IBCA is a single-country initiative focused solely on India's big cat conservation efforts, excluding international collaboration.
2.  All five big cat species found in India (Tiger, Lion, Leopard, Snow Leopard, Cheetah) are classified as endangered by the IUCN.
3. IBCA receives significant funding from various international organizations and governments to support its conservation programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that the SDG India Index 2023-24 is the fourth edition of the report, not the fifth.  It is crucial to accurately track the edition number for analytical purposes and understanding the evolution of the index's methodology and coverage over time.

Statement 2 is correct. The index utilizes a comprehensive set of 113 indicators to evaluate progress across various dimensions of sustainable development.  The alignment with the National Indicator Framework ensures consistency and comparability in the assessment of states and UTs' performance. The use of multiple indicators allows for a nuanced understanding of progress across different aspects of the SDGs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While a score of 100 indicates that a state/UT has achieved the targets set for 2030, it doesn't imply exceeding expectations.  A score of 100 represents the complete fulfillment of the predetermined goals for that year, but the index doesn't incorporate a mechanism for measuring performance beyond the defined targets.  The score reflects progress towards the 2030 targets, not a surpassing of them.

The requested USD 3.1 billion is allocated to strengthen the four fundamental pillars of effective early warning systems, ensuring that these systems are not only established but also robust and capable of providing timely and accurate warnings to vulnerable populations.  The investment plan highlights the scale and complexity of the undertaking.


**4. With reference to Parametric Insurance, consider the following statements:**

1. Parametric insurance compensates for the actual losses incurred from a covered event, rather than the probability of its occurrence.
2. Parametric insurance agreements offer a pre-specified payment upon the occurrence of a covered event that meets or exceeds a pre-defined intensity threshold, measured by an objective parameter.
3.  Covered events under parametric insurance primarily include earthquakes, tropical cyclones, and floods, with parameters such as magnitude, wind speed, or water depth, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Parametric insurance differs from traditional insurance in that it does not compensate for actual losses. Instead, it provides a pre-agreed payout based on the occurrence of a specific event reaching a defined threshold. The focus is on the event itself and its intensity, not the extent of the resulting damage. This makes it quicker and more efficient for payouts, especially in large-scale disasters.

Statement 2 is correct. The core principle of parametric insurance is the pre-defined payment triggered by an objective measurement of the covered event's intensity. This ensures clarity and speed in the claims process, reducing delays often associated with traditional insurance assessments of damage. The objective parameter simplifies the process and minimizes disputes.

Statement 3 is correct.  While parametric insurance can cover a range of events, the examples provided (earthquakes, tropical cyclones, floods) with their corresponding parameters (magnitude, wind speed, water depth) accurately reflect common applications.  These are events where objective measurement of intensity is readily available, making them suitable for this type of insurance.  The use of objective parameters reduces ambiguity and ensures consistent payouts.

2.  Cyclone formation in the western Arabian Sea is typically hindered by cooler sea surface temperatures and limited moisture from the Arabian Peninsula.
3. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues color-coded warnings for cyclone-prone areas, starting with a "Green" pre-cyclone watch issued 72 hours in advance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Historically, the Bay of Bengal has experienced a significantly higher number of cyclones compared to the Arabian Sea. The approximate ratio is indeed around 4:1.  This is due to several factors, including the warmer sea surface temperatures and higher moisture content in the Bay of Bengal, which provide the necessary energy for cyclone formation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While cooler sea surface temperatures can inhibit cyclone formation, the statement misrepresents the moisture conditions. The Arabian Sea does receive moisture, albeit perhaps less than the Bay of Bengal.  The statement incorrectly suggests that limited moisture from the Arabian Peninsula is a primary factor preventing cyclone formation in the western Arabian Sea.  Other factors, such as wind shear and atmospheric stability, play a more significant role.

Statement 3 is correct. The IMD's color-coded warning system is a crucial aspect of cyclone preparedness in India. The system uses green, yellow, orange, and red alerts to indicate the severity and proximity of cyclones, providing timely warnings to populations in vulnerable areas.  The timeline mentioned – a green alert issued 72 hours in advance – is accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPCB is a *statutory* body, not a constitutional body. It was formed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and it is entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection, but the CPCB's establishment predates this act.  The constitution doesn't directly establish the CPCB; it operates under the legal framework provided by specific environmental legislation.

Statement 2 is correct.  One of the CPCB's key mandates is improving the quality of air and water resources.  Promoting cleanliness of streams and wells and improving air quality are explicitly mentioned in the provided text as part of its functions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the CPCB *is* entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.  It works in conjunction with SPCBs to enforce environmental legislation, encompassing both air and water pollution control.  The statement incorrectly negates the CPCB's role under the Air Act.

1. The Chipko movement, primarily led by men, originated in the Reni village of Uttarakhand in the 1970s.
2.  The movement's core philosophy, Eco-feminism, emphasizes the interconnectedness of ecological concerns and gender inequality, although its roots trace back to the 18th-century Bishnoi community's resistance against deforestation.
3.  The movement's success led to a royal decree banning tree felling in all Bishnoi villages, significantly impacting forest conservation policies across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Chipko movement was primarily led by women, not men, and it began in the 1970s, not the 18th century. While the movement's origins are linked to the Bishnoi community's long history of environmental protection, the specific event in Reni village marked a pivotal moment in its modern form.  The movement's leadership included prominent figures like Sunderlal Bahuguna and Chandi Prasad Bhatt, but its strength lay in the collective mobilization of women.

Statement 2 is correct. Eco-feminism, a philosophy connecting ecological concerns with women's experiences and perspectives, is central to understanding the Chipko movement's success. The movement's nonviolent resistance, rooted in the community's deep connection to its environment, exemplifies this philosophy. The Bishnoi community's historical resistance against deforestation provides a crucial antecedent to the modern Chipko movement, highlighting a long-standing tradition of environmental protection.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Chipko movement undoubtedly influenced forest conservation, it did not directly lead to a royal decree banning tree felling in all Bishnoi villages. The Bishnoi community's resistance in the 18th century resulted in such a decree within their own communities, but the impact of the Chipko movement was broader, influencing environmental policies and awareness nationally and internationally.  The movement's success lies in its powerful demonstration of people's power and its impact on environmental awareness.


**2. With reference to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), consider the following statements:**

2.  The NGT functions independently of the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, ensuring unbiased environmental justice.
3.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) are responsible for implementing NGT's orders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NGT's jurisdiction extends beyond air pollution.  While it addresses cases related to air pollution under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, its mandate is broader, encompassing environmental issues covered by various laws and regulations.  It deals with a wide range of environmental matters, including water pollution, forest conservation, and biodiversity protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NGT, while functioning with a degree of autonomy, is ultimately part of the larger environmental governance structure within India. It operates under the overall framework of environmental laws and policies, and its actions are subject to judicial review. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change plays a significant role in shaping environmental policy and legislation, indirectly influencing the NGT's work.

Statement 3 is correct.  The CPCB and SPCBs are crucial in implementing the NGT's orders and decisions.  The NGT's judgments often require enforcement at the ground level, and these bodies are primarily responsible for carrying out the necessary actions.  Their role is vital in translating the NGT's pronouncements into practical environmental improvements.

2.  Uttarakhand and Kerala consistently rank among the top-performing states, reflecting their robust environmental policies and effective implementation mechanisms.
3.  The index's methodology includes 113 indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation's National Indicator Framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SDG India Index 2023-24 is released by NITI Aayog, not the UN DESA. While the index tracks progress on various SDGs, it doesn't assess all 17; it focuses on a subset of indicators. A score of 100 signifies achievement of the targets set for 2030 for the specific indicators included in the index.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While Uttarakhand and Kerala have consistently performed well, it's important to note that the rankings can fluctuate yearly based on the index's methodology and data updates.  Their strong performance reflects their focus on sustainable development, but the claim of "consistent" top ranking requires qualification.

Statement 3 is correct.  The SDG India Index 2023-24 uses 113 indicators aligned with the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation's National Indicator Framework.  This alignment ensures consistency and comparability in measuring progress across different states and union territories. The framework provides a structured approach to monitoring the SDGs at the national level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The agreement explicitly states that no country can claim sovereignty over MGRs in ABNJ. This principle is crucial for ensuring equitable access and benefit-sharing from marine genetic resources, preventing exploitation by individual nations.  The text highlights the importance of this aspect for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.


**10. With reference to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), consider the following statements:**

1. UNCLOS defines different zones of the ocean, including the territorial sea (up to 12 nautical miles), the contiguous zone (up to 24 nautical miles), and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (up to 200 nautical miles).
2. The high seas, encompassing approximately 64% of the ocean, are considered global commons under UNCLOS, meaning they are subject to the sovereignty of coastal states.
3.  UNCLOS, adopted in 1982 and enforced in 1994, has near-universal acceptance, with India among its state parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. UNCLOS provides a comprehensive framework for maritime zones, clarifying the rights and responsibilities of coastal states and the international community concerning the use of oceans. The definitions of territorial sea, contiguous zone, and EEZ are fundamental to understanding maritime law.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The high seas are considered *global commons*, meaning they are not subject to the sovereignty of any single state.  This principle is critical for ensuring the equitable use and protection of these vast ocean areas.  The text is clear that the high seas belong to no one and everyone enjoys equal rights.

Statement 3 is correct.  UNCLOS enjoys near-universal acceptance, with a vast majority of states being parties.  India's participation in UNCLOS reflects its commitment to international maritime law and cooperation.  The text mentions the treaty's almost universal acceptance and India's status as a party.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mitigation aims to reduce emissions, while adaptation focuses on managing the consequences of climate change.  This is a fundamental distinction in climate policy. Statement 2 is incorrect. The relative costs of mitigation and adaptation are complex and vary depending on the specific strategies and timelines considered.  The statement presents an oversimplified and potentially inaccurate comparison. Statement 3 is also incorrect. Developing countries often face greater challenges in implementing mitigation measures due to limited resources and capacity.  The statement makes a false assertion about relative capacity.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.



**1. With reference to Fungi and their significance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fungi exclusively reproduce through spores, lacking any form of asexual or vegetative reproduction.
2.  Mycorrhizal associations are parasitic relationships where fungi harm plant roots for their own benefit.
3.  Chile is the only country globally that has specific legal provisions for the conservation of fungi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While spores are a primary mode of fungal reproduction, many fungi also reproduce asexually through various methods like budding (in yeasts) or fragmentation of hyphae.  Vegetative propagation is also observed in some species.  The statement oversimplifies the reproductive diversity within the fungal kingdom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mycorrhizal associations are actually mutually beneficial (symbiotic) relationships between fungi and plant roots. The fungi gain carbohydrates from the plant, while the plant benefits from improved nutrient and water uptake facilitated by the extensive fungal network.  The statement incorrectly portrays it as parasitic.

Statement 3 is correct.  While many countries are increasingly incorporating fungal conservation into broader biodiversity strategies, Chile stands out as the only nation with specific legal frameworks dedicated to protecting fungi. This highlights Chile's progressive approach to biodiversity conservation.


**2. With reference to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WNBR was established in 1971 under the Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme of UNESCO.

1. India ranked among the top 20 countries in the NCI, indicating strong conservation efforts.
2. The NCI evaluates conservation efforts using markers such as land management, threats to biodiversity, capacity and governance, and future trends.
3. The NCI is an index that measures the level of carbon emissions within a specific region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India ranked 176 out of 180 countries in the NCI, indicating relatively weak conservation efforts, not strong ones. The statement misrepresents India's ranking in the index.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the NCI's evaluation criteria, including land management, threats to biodiversity, capacity and governance, and future trends. This is a direct reflection of the index's methodology.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCI assesses conservation efforts, not carbon emissions.  The statement confuses the NCI's focus with a different environmental metric.


**10. With reference to the UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlighted that all of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation have quantified forest targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The UN-REDD Programme is a UN initiative focusing on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, aiming to advance the Paris Agreement.
3.  The UN-REDD report emphasizes that while many NDCs include targets for afforestation and reforestation, reducing deforestation is a more critical initial step in mitigating climate change.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-REDD report actually found that only *eight*, not all, of the top 20 countries with the highest rates of tropical deforestation had quantified forest targets in their NDCs.  The statement significantly overstates the number of countries meeting this criterion.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes UN-REDD as a UN program focused on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and its aim to advance the Paris Agreement.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly reports the UN-REDD report's emphasis on the importance of reducing deforestation as a primary step in climate change mitigation, even though many countries include afforestation and reforestation targets in their NDCs.  This reflects the report's key message.



**1. With reference to Fungi, consider the following statements:**

1. Fungi are primarily autotrophic organisms, deriving energy from sunlight through photosynthesis.
2.  The cell walls of fungi are composed of cellulose, a complex carbohydrate.
3.  Mycorrhizal associations are parasitic relationships between fungi and plant roots, where the fungi benefit at the expense of the plant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms, meaning they obtain their energy by consuming organic matter.  They do not photosynthesize.  Their cell walls are composed of chitin, not cellulose.  Cellulose is the primary structural component of plant cell walls. Finally, mycorrhizal associations are *mutually beneficial* (symbiotic) relationships between fungi and plant roots. The fungi receive carbohydrates from the plant, and in return, they enhance the plant's access to water and nutrients.  The relationship is crucial for the growth and health of many plants, especially trees.  A parasitic relationship would be one where one organism benefits at the expense of the other, which is not the case here.


**2. With reference to the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The WNBR is a program initiated by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to protect globally significant ecosystems.
2.  As of 2024, the WNBR includes over 700 sites across more than 130 countries.
3.  The Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, under which WNBR operates, focuses solely on terrestrial ecosystems and excludes marine environments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WNBR is a program of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme, not the WWF.  Statement 2 is largely correct.  The text states that the WNBR includes 759 sites in 136 countries, making the slightly lower numbers in option 2 a plausible distractor. Statement 3 is incorrect. The MAB Programme encompasses both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, aiming for a holistic approach to conservation and sustainable development.  The inclusion of marine biosphere reserves demonstrates the program's broader scope.


**3. With reference to Coral Bleaching, consider the following statements:**

1. Coral bleaching is caused primarily by an increase in ocean salinity levels, leading to dehydration of coral polyps.
2.  Porites lutea and Pavona varians are coral species particularly vulnerable to bleaching, even under relatively low stress conditions.
3.  The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) is a non-governmental organization focused solely on raising public awareness about coral reef conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While changes in salinity can stress corals, the primary cause of coral bleaching is increased ocean temperatures due to climate change.  This leads to the expulsion of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that provide corals with their color and nutrients. Statement 2 is correct. The passage notes that even stress-tolerant species like *Porites lutea* and *Pavona varians* have shown bleaching, highlighting the severity of the current events.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The ICRI is an intergovernmental initiative, not solely a non-governmental organization. It plays a significant role in coordinating international efforts for coral reef conservation, including research, policy development, and capacity building.


**4.  With reference to Gape Limitation, Megafauna, and Stromatolites, consider the following statements:**

1. Gape limitation refers to the upper size limit of prey that a predator can consume, primarily determined by the predator's body size.
2. Megafauna are defined as animals weighing less than 50 kg, encompassing a wide range of species across various ecosystems.
3. Stromatolites are exclusively found in deep-sea environments, due to their sensitivity to sunlight and fluctuating temperatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Gape limitation is indeed a key ecological concept describing the size constraint on prey selection by predators, and it is primarily determined by the predator's mouth size. Statement 2 is incorrect. Megafauna are defined as animals exceeding a certain weight threshold, generally above 50 kg.  The statement reverses this definition. Statement 3 is incorrect. While stromatolites are often found in extreme environments, they are not exclusively limited to deep-sea habitats. The text mentions a recent discovery of shallow-marine stromatolites near the Red Sea.  This highlights the adaptability and wider distribution of these microbial communities than commonly assumed.


**5. With reference to Environmental DNA (eDNA), Speciation, and Bioluminescence, consider the following statements:**

1. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is an expensive and unreliable method for detecting species presence and assessing biodiversity.
2. Sympatric speciation involves the formation of new species in geographically isolated populations.
3. Bioluminescence is the emission of light by living organisms, primarily produced through chemiluminescence reactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. eDNA analysis is increasingly recognized as a cost-effective and reliable method for biodiversity assessment.  It offers advantages over traditional methods by being less invasive and more sensitive in detecting rare or elusive species. Statement 2 is incorrect. Sympatric speciation occurs when new species arise within the same geographic area, without physical isolation.  Allopatric speciation is the one that involves geographic isolation. Statement 3 is correct. Bioluminescence is indeed the emission of light by living organisms, and it's primarily produced through enzyme-catalyzed oxidation reactions (chemiluminescence) involving luciferin and either luciferase or photoprotein.


**6. With reference to Factory Farming, Woody Encroachment, and Green and Blue Water, consider the following statements:**

1. Factory farming is associated with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved animal welfare.
2. Woody encroachment refers to the decrease in tree and shrub cover in open ecosystems, leading to biodiversity loss.
3. Green water refers to surface and groundwater resources, while blue water refers to water stored in soil and vegetation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Factory farming is linked to significant environmental problems, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, antibiotic resistance, and animal welfare concerns due to high-density confinement. Statement 2 is incorrect. Woody encroachment is the *increase*, not decrease, in tree and shrub cover, often at the expense of open habitats like grasslands and savannas. This can negatively impact biodiversity by reducing the habitat available for grassland species. Statement 3 is incorrect. The definitions of green and blue water are reversed. Green water refers to water stored in soil and vegetation, while blue water encompasses surface and groundwater resources.


**7. With reference to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, consider the following statements:**

1. The IUCN Red List categorizes species solely based on population size, without considering other factors like habitat loss or threats.
2. The La Gomera giant lizard's status was upgraded from Endangered to Critically Endangered in a recent update.
3. The Bornean elephant is categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List assessment considers a multitude of factors beyond population size when evaluating a species' extinction risk. These include habitat loss, fragmentation, pollution, climate change, and other threats. Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the La Gomera giant lizard's status was upgraded from Critically Endangered to Endangered.  This indicates a positive trend in its conservation status. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the Bornean elephant is categorized as Endangered, not Vulnerable.  The distinction between Endangered and Vulnerable reflects different levels of extinction risk.


**8. With reference to  Carbon Accounting, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and Water Credits, consider the following statements:**

1. "Red carbon" refers to carbon stored in the atmosphere.
2. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are scenarios describing future pathways of greenhouse gas emissions and their impacts.
3. Water credits are a market-based mechanism similar to carbon credits, designed to incentivize water conservation and quality improvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Red carbon refers to carbon released through biological particles on snow and ice that reduce albedo (reflectivity), contributing to climate change.  It's not carbon stored in the atmosphere. Statement 2 is correct. RCPs are indeed scenarios used by the IPCC to model various potential climate futures based on different greenhouse gas emission pathways.  These scenarios help scientists understand the likely impacts of climate change under different emission scenarios. Statement 3 is correct. Water credits operate on a similar principle to carbon credits, providing economic incentives for water conservation and improved water management practices.


**9. With reference to Biodiversity Credits and Glacial Geoengineering, consider the following statements:**

1. Biodiversity credits are only used to compensate for unavoidable negative impacts on biodiversity.
2. Glacial geoengineering aims to accelerate the melting of glaciers to increase water availability in downstream areas.
3. Glacial geoengineering techniques include interventions to reduce the flow of warm ocean water towards ice shelves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Biodiversity credits can be used to finance activities that have a net-positive impact on biodiversity, not just to compensate for unavoidable negative impacts.  This makes them a broader tool for conservation finance than biodiversity offsets. Statement 2 is incorrect. Glacial geoengineering aims to *slow* the melting of glaciers, not accelerate it.  The goal is to mitigate the effects of climate change on glaciers and reduce sea-level rise. Statement 3 is correct.  The text specifically mentions ocean-heat transport interventions, such as using sediment berms or fibrous curtains, as a proposed glacial geoengineering strategy.


**10. With reference to Soil Acidification and Biocovers, consider the following statements:**

1. Soil acidification leads to increased nutrient availability for plants.
2.  Biocovers utilize methanotrophic bacteria to convert methane into carbon dioxide.
3. Biocovers are primarily used for remediation of oil spills and other hazardous waste.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Soil acidification has several negative consequences, including reduced nutrient availability, increased aluminum toxicity, and harm to soil microbes.  It does not increase nutrient availability. Statement 2 is correct. Biocovers utilize methanotrophic bacteria, which are microorganisms capable of using methane as their primary carbon and energy source.  These bacteria convert methane into carbon dioxide, a less potent greenhouse gas. Statement 3 is incorrect. While biocovers have potential applications in various environmental remediation strategies, their primary use, as described in the text, is controlling fugitive methane emissions from old dumpsites.  They act as biofilters, not as direct remediators of oil spills or other hazardous wastes.


**11. With reference to the Grasshopper Effect and WHO Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Grasshopper Effect refers to the phenomenon where pollutants are transported from lower latitudes to the Arctic region.
2.  WHO AQGs only provide recommendations for PM2.5 and ozone (O3) levels.
3.  The Global Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Assessment report was primarily authored by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Grasshopper Effect describes the long-range atmospheric transport of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and other chemicals from lower latitudes to the Arctic, where they accumulate. Statement 2 is incorrect. WHO AQGs provide recommendations for several common air pollutants, including PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The statement is too narrow in its scope. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Global Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Assessment report was published by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), not the WHO.  The WHO contributes to air quality guidelines but did not solely author this specific report.


**12. With reference to Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) and the properties of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), consider the following statements:**

1. FGD systems are primarily used to remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the flue gases of coal-fired power plants.
2. SO2 is a colorless, odorless gas that contributes to acid rain.
3.  Seawater-based FGD systems are not commonly used due to their high cost and environmental impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FGD systems are designed to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2), not nitrogen oxides (NOx), from the flue gases of coal-fired power plants.  NOx removal often requires separate technologies. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While SO2 does contribute to acid rain, it is described as having a strong odor, not being odorless.  The statement mixes up factual data. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions that three types of FGD systems, including seawater-based systems, are adopted worldwide, indicating that they are indeed used and not necessarily uncommon.  The statement assumes that a less common technology is not used.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme:**

1. IDWH provides support exclusively to protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
2.  The Species Recovery Program under IDWH has identified over 30 critically endangered species for focused conservation efforts.
3. Project Tiger, Project Elephant, and Project Dolphin are all sub-schemes operating under the IDWH umbrella.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IDWH does provide significant support to protected areas, a crucial component of the scheme is the protection of wildlife *outside* protected areas, acknowledging the importance of habitat connectivity and addressing threats beyond designated reserves.  The scheme aims for a holistic approach to wildlife conservation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that 22 species have been identified under the Species Recovery Program so far.  The actual number might be higher, but the statement's claim of "over 30" is inaccurate and therefore incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct. Project Tiger (1973), Project Elephant (1992), and Project Dolphin are explicitly mentioned in the text as sub-schemes functioning under the IDWH initiative.  These projects represent focused conservation efforts for specific flagship species and their habitats.  This showcases IDWH's role in coordinating and supporting various targeted conservation strategies.


**2. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The preparation of PBRs is mandated by the Indian Forest Act of 1927, requiring Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) to involve local communities.
2. PBRs primarily focus on documenting the economic value of local bioresources, facilitating their commercial exploitation.
3.  Information within a PBR includes details on the traditional knowledge associated with local biological resources and their uses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The legal basis for PBRs is the Biological Diversity Act of 2002, not the Indian Forest Act of 1927. The 2002 Act established the framework for BMCs and their role in preparing PBRs in consultation with local communities.  The Indian Forest Act primarily deals with forest management and conservation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While PBRs can indirectly contribute to the sustainable use of bioresources, their primary aim is to *document and safeguard* bioresources and associated knowledge, not to facilitate commercial exploitation. The focus is on preserving traditional knowledge and ensuring community benefits from biodiversity.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that PBRs document the availability and knowledge of local biological resources, including their medicinal or other uses, and any associated traditional knowledge. This comprehensive documentation is central to the PBR's purpose of protecting both biodiversity and cultural heritage.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024:**

1. The EPI 2024 ranks countries based solely on their performance in mitigating climate change.
2.  India's ranking in the EPI 2024 reflects a significant improvement compared to its performance in previous years.
3.  The EPI 2024 utilizes a comprehensive set of indicators across multiple environmental issue categories to evaluate countries' environmental performance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The EPI 2024's assessment is not limited to climate change mitigation.  The provided text explicitly mentions that the index ranks countries across three broad areas: climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality, employing a total of 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that India was ranked 176th out of 180 countries in the EPI 2024.  This indicates a relatively poor performance, not an improvement.  While the text does not provide previous year's rankings, the given rank does not suggest improvement.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly describes the EPI 2024 methodology, highlighting its use of 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories to assess climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality.  This multi-faceted approach contrasts with the overly simplistic description in statement 1.


**4. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NCI 2024 was published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
2. India's ranking in the NCI 2024 was significantly better than its ranking in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024.
3. The NCI 2024 assesses countries' performance across a range of environmental indicators, including biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCI 2024 was released by the Goldman Sonnenfeldt School of Sustainability and Climate Change, not the UNEP.  Attributing the index to the UNEP is a clear factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Both the NCI 2024 and the EPI 2024 ranked India at 176th out of 180 countries.  Therefore, there was no significant difference in India's ranking between these two indices.  The statement implies a difference that does not exist.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While it is plausible that the NCI 2024 considers biodiversity and climate change, the provided text does not specify the exact indicators used in the NCI's assessment. The statement makes an assumption about the index's scope that cannot be confirmed from the given information.  To be correct, the statement would need verifiable supporting evidence from the index's methodology description.


**5. Consider the following statements about the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:**

1. The IUCN Red List categorizes species solely based on their population size.
2. The IUCN Red List includes only animal species, excluding plants and fungi.
3. The IUCN Red List provides information about species at risk of extinction, using a classification system with multiple categories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IUCN Red List's assessment of a species' threat status is not based solely on population size.  It considers various factors, including population size, geographic range, habitat loss, and other threats.  Population size is one factor among many.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IUCN Red List encompasses a wide range of species, including animals, plants, and fungi.  The statement's exclusion of plants and fungi is inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that the IUCN Red List classifies species at risk of extinction into nine categories.  This multi-category system allows for a nuanced assessment of different levels of threat, providing more detailed information than a simple "endangered" or "not endangered" classification.


**6.  With reference to the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC), consider the following statements:**

1. The SFTLC was organized by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
2.  A key objective of the SFTLC is to mobilize significant new funding for tiger conservation.
3. The Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC) is a government-led initiative focused solely on tiger conservation in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SFTLC was hosted by the Bhutan government and supported by the Tiger Conservation Coalition (TCC), not the WWF.  Attributing the conference to the WWF is factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the SFTLC aims to mobilize US$1 billion in additional funding for tiger protection and its landscapes by 2034. This goal highlights the conference's focus on securing financial resources for conservation efforts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The TCC is described as an *independent* group of organizations, not a government-led initiative.  Furthermore, its focus is not limited to India; it brings together leading biologists and experts to achieve tiger conservation globally.  The statement contains multiple inaccuracies.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The program covers the Great Indian Bustard and the Lesser Florican, not exclusively the Great Indian Bustard.  The statement inaccurately limits the program's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rajasthan Forest Department is a partner, the program's implementation involves multiple agencies, including the Wildlife Institute of India, other state forest departments (Gujarat & Maharashtra), and various collaborating organizations. The statement wrongly attributes sole responsibility to a single agency.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions "Conservation Breeding" and "Pilot Implementation of Surgical Habitat Management" as project objectives.  This demonstrates the program's use of both ex-situ and in-situ conservation strategies.


**11. Consider the following statements about mangroves:**

1. Mangroves are primarily found in arctic and subarctic regions.
2. Mangroves contribute significantly to carbon sequestration.
3. The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems classified approximately half of the assessed ecosystems as threatened.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mangroves are found in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate coastal regions, not arctic or subarctic regions.  The statement misrepresents the geographical distribution of mangroves.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that mangroves contribute significantly to carbon sequestration, storing approximately 11 billion tons of carbon—three times the amount stored by tropical forests of a similar size.

Statement 3 is correct. The text indicates that the IUCN Red List assessment of 36 regions across 44 countries showed that about 50% of the examined mangrove ecosystems were classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. This highlights the significant threat to mangrove ecosystems.


**12. With reference to the Ramsar Convention, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramsar Convention was adopted in 1992.
2. The Montreux Record identifies Ramsar sites facing ecological changes due to human activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage specifies that the hydrogel consists of *three* different polymer layers: chitosan, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyaniline. The statement incorrectly reduces this to a single layer.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage lists several applications of hydrogels, including hygiene products, medical applications, and industrial lubricants, demonstrating their broader use beyond environmental remediation.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme:**

1. IDWH primarily focuses on supporting protected areas, neglecting wildlife outside these designated zones.
2.  The Species Recovery Program under IDWH has successfully revived over 50 critically endangered species and their habitats.
3. Project Tiger, Project Dolphin, and Project Lion are all sub-schemes operating under the IDWH umbrella.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IDWH's objective explicitly includes the protection of wildlife *outside* protected areas, not just within them.  The scheme aims for a holistic approach to wildlife conservation, recognizing that wildlife doesn't always confine itself to designated protected areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IDWH does include a Species Recovery Program, the provided text states that *22* species have been identified under this program, not over 50. This demonstrates a significant difference and highlights the need for precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 3 is correct. Project Tiger (initiated in 1973), Project Elephant (initiated in 1992), and Project Lion are all explicitly mentioned as sub-schemes functioning under the IDWH framework.  This showcases the comprehensive nature of IDWH in encompassing various species-specific conservation efforts.  The accurate identification of these sub-schemes within the larger IDWH structure is crucial for demonstrating a thorough understanding of Indian wildlife conservation policies.  The dates provided also allow for testing knowledge of the timeline of these crucial projects.


**2. With reference to the People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PBR is mandated by the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, requiring all Panchayats to maintain one.
2.  The primary purpose of the PBR is to facilitate the commercial exploitation of local bioresources for economic gain.
3.  Information included in the PBR typically covers the medicinal and other traditional uses of local biological resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PBR is actually mandated by the Biological Diversity Act of 2002, not the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific legal framework governing biodiversity conservation in India. The statement also incorrectly implies that all Panchayats are required to maintain a PBR.  The phrasing is designed to be a subtle but effective distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The main aim of the PBR is not commercial exploitation but rather the documentation and *safeguarding* of bioresources and associated traditional knowledge. The emphasis is on conservation and sustainable use, not profit maximization. The inclusion of this statement introduces a common misconception about conservation initiatives, serving as a useful distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PBR explicitly aims to document the traditional knowledge associated with local biological resources, including their medicinal and other uses.  This accurate recall of the PBR's content is key to answering the question correctly.  The statement also subtly tests the candidate's understanding of the importance of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in conservation efforts.


**3. With reference to the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The EPI 2024 ranked 180 countries based on 40 performance indicators across 10 issue categories.
2. India's ranking in the EPI 2024 was significantly higher than China's.
3. The EPI is published by the World Bank, a global financial institution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The EPI 2024 used 58 performance indicators, not 40, and covered 11 issue categories, not 10. This demonstrates the importance of precise numerical recall in environmental indices.  The slight alteration of numbers makes the statement plausible but ultimately incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that India ranked 176th in the EPI 2024, while it does not provide China's ranking.  More importantly, the text notes that India surpassed China as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2 in 2022 – indicating that India's environmental performance is likely *worse* than China's, not better.  This statement uses a subtly misleading comparison to create a trap.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The EPI 2024 is published by the Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy, not the World Bank.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific organizations involved in environmental reporting and ranking.  The substitution of a related but incorrect organization is a common technique in creating challenging MCQ's.


**4. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The NCI 2024 ranked India among the top 20 countries globally in terms of nature conservation efforts.
2.  The NCI is published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
3.  The NCI primarily assesses countries' performance on biodiversity conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text indicates that India ranked 176th out of 180 countries in the NCI 2024, far from being among the top 20. This stark contrast between the statement and the actual ranking makes for a compelling distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCI 2024 was released by the Goldman Sonnenfeldt School of Sustainability and Climate Change, not the UNEP. This tests the candidate's awareness of different organizations involved in environmental assessments. The substitution of a well-known environmental organization for the actual publisher is designed to mislead.

Statement 3 is incorrect while not explicitly stated in the text provided, the NCI's focus on nature conservation is broad, encompassing various environmental aspects beyond just biodiversity.  While biodiversity is undoubtedly a significant component, the statement's limiting focus serves as a subtle distractor.  The lack of precise detail regarding the NCI's scope makes it a challenging statement to evaluate definitively.


**1. With reference to the Nature Conservation Index (NCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCI evaluates conservation efforts using five markers: Land management, Threats to biodiversity, Capacity and governance, Future trends, and Species extinction rate.
2. In the 2024 NCI ranking, India secured a position below the median, indicating significant room for improvement in its conservation strategies.
3. The NCI is primarily focused on assessing the effectiveness of government policies and their impact on biodiversity conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text mentions only four markers used by the NCI: Land management, Threats to biodiversity, Capacity and governance, and Future trends.  The addition of "Species extinction rate" is a distractor, designed to test the candidate's precise recall of the information.  While species extinction is undoubtedly relevant to conservation efforts, it's not explicitly listed as a primary marker in the source.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states India's rank as 176 out of 180 countries, clearly placing it below the median. This highlights the need for enhanced conservation strategies.

Statement 3 is partially correct but oversimplified. While the NCI does evaluate government policies and their impact, it's not solely focused on this aspect. The index likely considers a broader range of factors influencing biodiversity conservation, including societal factors and private initiatives.  The framing of the statement as a primary focus is a misleading simplification.


**2. With reference to the International Year of Camelids (2024), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN declared 2024 as the International Year of Camelids to celebrate the cultural significance of camels in various societies.
2.  The Kharai camel, known for its ability to swim long distances in the sea to graze on mangroves, is found exclusively in the Sundarbans region of West Bengal.
3. Bactrian camels, characterized by their two humps, are primarily found in the arid regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that the UN declared 2024 the International Year of Camelids to build awareness of their untapped potential.  While cultural significance is implicitly present, the primary focus, as stated, is on the potential of camelids.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that the Kharai camel, which swims to eat mangroves, is found in Kutch, Gujarat, not the Sundarbans.  The Sundarbans is a different geographical location known for its unique mangrove ecosystem. This statement plays on the association of camels and mangroves to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bactrian camels (two-humped) are explicitly mentioned as being found in Ladakh's Nubra Valley, not Rajasthan and Gujarat.  Dromedary camels (one-humped) are found in the hot deserts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The statement confuses the types of camels and their geographical distribution to mislead the candidate.


**3. With reference to the UN-REDD Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-REDD Programme's recent report highlights that a majority of the top 20 countries with high deforestation rates have included forest-related targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The UN-REDD Programme primarily focuses on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developed nations.
3.  The UN-REDD Programme's report emphasizes that afforestation and reforestation efforts are sufficient to address climate change effectively without addressing the root cause of deforestation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-REDD report actually finds that *only 8* out of the top 20 countries with the highest tropical deforestation rates have quantified forest targets in their NDCs. The statement presents the opposite of the actual finding.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UN-REDD Programme addresses deforestation globally, it doesn't explicitly prioritize developed nations.  Its focus is on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, regardless of the nation's development status.  The statement creates a false sense of regional prioritization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UN-REDD report stresses that mitigating climate change requires reducing deforestation *first*, before focusing on afforestation and reforestation.  These latter actions are considered supplementary, not sufficient, solutions.  The statement misrepresents the report's core message on the importance of tackling the root cause of deforestation.


**4. With reference to the IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems, consider the following statements:**

1. The assessment covered mangrove ecosystems across 60 countries, revealing a concerningly high proportion of critically endangered ecosystems.
2. Mangrove ecosystems in South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and the Northwest Atlantic were identified as vulnerable, not critically endangered.
3.  The IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems is a key indicator for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The assessment covered 44 countries, not 60. The inflated number is a distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of the details.  The statement also uses "concerningly high proportion" which is vague and could apply to various percentages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the mangrove ecosystems of South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and the Northwest Atlantic were identified as *critically endangered*, not vulnerable.  This is a direct contradiction.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the IUCN Red List of Mangrove Ecosystems is one of the headline indicators for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.


**5. With reference to India's mangrove conservation initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The MISHTI initiative focuses solely on increasing the income of coastal communities through mangrove-based aquaculture.
2. The "Magical Mangroves" campaign is a government-led initiative aimed at mangrove restoration.
3. The Sustainable Aquaculture In Mangrove Ecosystem (SAIME) initiative promotes integrated mangrove aquaculture systems (IMA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MISHTI aims to increase tangible incomes, it also focuses on shoreline habitat restoration, not solely aquaculture.  The statement narrows the scope of the initiative, creating a misleading simplification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Magical Mangroves" campaign is led by WWF India, a non-governmental organization, not the government.  Attributing it to the government is a common misconception easily exploited as a distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly mentions that the SAIME initiative uses integrated mangrove aquaculture (IMA) systems.


**6. With reference to the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The FAC is a non-statutory body under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC).
2.  The FAC's role is solely advisory, with no power to enforce its decisions regarding forest land diversion.
3. The FAC recently approved the felling of up to 100 trees for all developmental projects in forest areas without any restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that FAC is a *statutory* body under the MoEF&CC. The statement inverts the factual information.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clarifies that the FAC's role is *recommendatory* in nature regarding forest land diversion; it doesn't have the authority to enforce its recommendations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FAC exempted surveys involving drilling and felling of up to 100 trees for *hydro and other developmental projects*, implying that there are still some restrictions and not a blanket approval for all projects.  The statement removes the conditionality and presents an oversimplification of the FAC's decision.


**7. With reference to the Forest Ecosystem Restoration Initiative (FERI), consider the following statements:**

1. FERI was launched as a collaboration between the Indian Forest Service and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Secretariat.
2. FERI's primary objective is to promote sustainable forest management practices to enhance biodiversity.
3. FERI celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2024.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that FERI was launched as a partnership between the *Korea Forest Service (KFS)* and the CBD Secretariat, not the Indian Forest Service. This is a crucial detail that differentiates the actual organization from a similar-sounding entity.

Statement 2 is correct. While the text doesn't explicitly state "enhance biodiversity," the broader context of ecosystem restoration strongly implies that biodiversity enhancement is a key objective.  The statement uses a more general phrasing to make it potentially true.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions FERI's *10th*, not 20th, anniversary.  The incorrect anniversary is a simple numerical error that could lead to a wrong answer if not carefully checked.


**8. With reference to Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs), consider the following statements:**

1. ESZs are primarily established to prohibit all human activities within designated areas to maximize ecological protection.
2. The ESZ guidelines classify activities into two categories: permitted and prohibited.
3. ESZs act as transition zones between areas of higher protection (like Protected Areas) and areas with lesser protection, facilitating a gradual change in land use intensity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ESZs don't aim to prohibit *all* human activities.  The text indicates that activities are regulated, not entirely prohibited, to ensure a balance between conservation and human needs.  The statement presents an extreme position to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifies *three* categories of activities within ESZs: prohibited, regulated, and permitted.  The omission of one category is a critical factual error.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes ESZs as transition zones that buffer protected areas, allowing for a gradual shift in land use intensity.


**9. With reference to the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:**

1. The Western Ghats mountain range stretches across seven states in India.
2. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) recommended designating only a portion of the Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).
3. The High-Level Working Group (HLWG), headed by Dr. K. Kasturirangan, proposed a color-coding system for industries operating within the Western Ghats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text doesn't explicitly state the exact number of states, it mentions that the Western Ghats cover an area under *six* states, not seven.  The addition of one state is a subtle numerical error designed to test precision.

Statement 2 is correct. The WGEEP recommended designating the *entire* region as an ESA, not just a portion.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual recommendation.

Statement 3 is correct. The HLWG did propose a color-coding system for industries to categorize them based on their environmental impact within the Western Ghats region.


**10. With reference to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEEA framework is primarily used to track economic growth indicators without considering environmental factors.
2.  EnviStats India 2024, which utilizes the SEEA framework, shows a decline in India's mangrove cover between 2013 and 2021.
3.  The SEEA-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) component measures the economic value of individual environmental resources like timber and water.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEEA framework explicitly describes the interaction between the economy and the environment, directly incorporating environmental factors into economic accounting.  This statement presents a complete misrepresentation of the SEEA's purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. EnviStats India 2024 actually shows an *increase* in mangrove cover (around 8%) between 2013 and 2021, not a decline.  The inversion of the actual trend is a significant distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SEEA-EA measures ecosystems and their services, while SEEA-CF measures individual resources.  The statement confuses the roles of the two components of the SEEA framework.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding microplastics:**

1. Primary microplastics are larger plastic items that break down into smaller particles.
2. Secondary microplastics are intentionally manufactured tiny plastic particles used in various products.
3. Microplastic ingestion by marine organisms disrupts the food chain and can have adverse effects on human health through bioaccumulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Microplastics, regardless of their origin (primary or secondary), pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems.  Marine organisms ingest these particles, leading to bioaccumulation of toxins within their bodies. This contamination moves up the food chain, ultimately impacting humans who consume seafood.  The presence of microplastics in human blood, lungs, breast milk, and other tissues is a growing concern, highlighting the potential for various health problems.


Statement 1 is incorrect. Primary microplastics are defined as small plastic particles intentionally manufactured for use in various products, like cosmetics and clothing, or those that are shed as microfibers from textiles. They are not the result of the breakdown of larger plastics.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Secondary microplastics are those that result from the breakdown of larger plastic items due to environmental factors like weathering and UV degradation. These are not intentionally produced as tiny particles.  The distinction between primary and secondary microplastics is crucial for understanding the sources and pathways of microplastic pollution.



**2. With reference to Gape Limitation in ecology, consider the following statements:**

1. Gape limitation primarily refers to the physiological constraints on the speed at which a predator can consume its prey.
2.  Larger predators, due to their larger gape size, can consume a wider variety of prey sizes compared to smaller predators.
3. Gape limitation plays a minimal role in shaping food webs and regulating predator-prey dynamics within ecosystems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Gape limitation is a fundamental ecological concept that directly relates to the physical size of a predator's mouth (gape). This physical constraint dictates the maximum size of prey an organism can consume. Larger predators, with larger gapes, have a broader range of prey options available to them, while smaller predators are restricted to smaller prey. This principle plays a crucial role in structuring food webs and influencing predator-prey relationships.


Statement 1 is incorrect. Gape limitation focuses on the physical size constraints on prey consumption, not the speed of consumption. While the speed of consumption can be influenced by numerous factors, the primary aspect of gape limitation is the maximum size of prey a predator can physically handle.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  Gape limitation is a significant factor in shaping food webs and regulating predator-prey dynamics. It influences species interactions, community structure, and overall ecosystem stability. The size-selective predation imposed by gape limitation can lead to cascading effects throughout the food web, influencing the abundance and distribution of various species.  Ignoring gape limitation would lead to a severely incomplete understanding of ecological interactions.



**3. With reference to Stromatolites, consider the following statements:**

1. Stromatolites are exclusively found in deep-sea environments due to their sensitivity to light and temperature fluctuations.
2.  Stromatolites played a crucial role in the Great Oxidation Event by releasing significant amounts of oxygen into the early Earth's atmosphere.
3. Recent discoveries indicate that living shallow-marine stromatolites are extremely rare and geographically restricted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Stromatolites, layered structures formed by microbial communities, played a crucial role in the Great Oxidation Event.  Through photosynthesis, these microbial mats released substantial quantities of oxygen into the atmosphere, fundamentally altering Earth's environment and paving the way for the evolution of oxygen-dependent life forms.


Statement 3 is correct. While stromatolites were once abundant, they are now largely restricted to extreme environments.  The recent discovery of living shallow-marine stromatolites highlights their rarity and the specific environmental conditions required for their survival.  Their limited distribution underlines the importance of protecting these unique ecosystems.


Statement 1 is incorrect. Stromatolites are not exclusively found in deep-sea environments. While they can thrive in such environments, they are also found in other areas, including shallow-water settings, although their presence in shallow waters is less common today due to increased competition from other life forms.



**4. Consider the following statements about Plankton crashes:**

1. Plankton crashes are primarily caused by an overabundance of nutrients in the water.
2. A sudden increase in water salinity can trigger a plankton crash.
3. Plankton crashes can occur in the early stages of the production cycle due to a lack of essential resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. Plankton crashes, which refer to a sudden decline in plankton populations, can occur during the early stages of the production cycle. This is often due to limitations in essential resources like nutrients or carbon dioxide (CO2), which are necessary for growth and survival.  A shortage of these resources can severely impact plankton populations, leading to a crash.


Statement 1 is incorrect.  An overabundance of nutrients, a phenomenon known as eutrophication, can lead to algal blooms, but these blooms are often followed by crashes as the nutrients are depleted and oxygen levels decrease.  Therefore, an excess of nutrients is not the primary cause of plankton crashes, but rather a contributing factor in some cases.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While changes in water quality can certainly impact plankton populations, a sudden increase in salinity is not the primary or most common cause of a plankton crash. Other factors, such as temperature fluctuations, pollution, or disease outbreaks, are more likely to trigger a crash.  Plankton crashes are complex events influenced by a multitude of factors.


**5. Consider the following statements about Megafauna:**

1. Megafauna are defined as animals weighing less than 50 kg.
2. Megafauna can be classified based on their dietary habits into megaherbivores, megacarnivores, and megaomnivores.
3. Anthropogenic pressures have significantly impacted megafauna populations, especially megaherbivores and megacarnivores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Megafauna, generally defined as animals exceeding a certain weight threshold (usually above 50 kg), can be categorized based on their dietary preferences. Megaherbivores are plant-eaters, megacarnivores are meat-eaters, and megaomnivores consume both plants and meat. This classification helps to understand their ecological roles and the impact of their dietary habits on ecosystems.

Statement 3 is correct. Human activities, or anthropogenic pressures, have had a profound impact on megafauna populations throughout history and continue to do so.  Habitat loss, hunting, poaching, and climate change are among the major threats facing megafauna, particularly large herbivores and carnivores.  The decline in megafauna populations has significant implications for ecosystem stability and biodiversity.


Statement 1 is incorrect. Megafauna are defined as animals weighing *more* than 50 kg, not less.  The weight threshold is a crucial criterion in defining megafauna, distinguishing them from smaller animals.  This weight classification reflects the ecological significance of large-bodied animals and their roles within their respective ecosystems.

**6. With reference to Bioluminescence, consider the following statements:**

1. Bioluminescence is the ability of living organisms to absorb and re-emit light.
2. The light emitted by bioluminescent organisms is typically produced through chemiluminescence, involving chemical reactions.
3. Bioluminescence is exhibited only by marine organisms such as jellyfish and deep-sea shrimps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. This light is generated through a process called chemiluminescence, which involves a chemical reaction where energy is released in the form of light.  The reaction typically involves two key components: luciferin (a light-emitting molecule) and luciferase (an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction).


Statement 1 is incorrect. Bioluminescence involves the *production* and *emission* of light, not the absorption and re-emission of external light.  The process is internally driven by chemical reactions within the organism, unlike fluorescence or phosphorescence, which involve the absorption and subsequent release of light.


Statement 3 is incorrect. Bioluminescence is not limited to marine organisms. While it is prevalent in marine environments, it is also found in terrestrial organisms such as fireflies and certain fungi. The diversity of bioluminescent organisms spans various taxa and habitats, highlighting the widespread occurrence of this fascinating phenomenon.


**7. Consider the following statements about Environmental DNA (eDNA):**

1. eDNA refers to the genetic material of organisms that is found only in aquatic environments.
2. eDNA analysis is a relatively inexpensive and reliable method for detecting species presence and assessing biodiversity.
3. eDNA data can contribute to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species assessments and other conservation initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis offers a cost-effective and reliable method for detecting species presence and assessing biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. By extracting and analyzing DNA from environmental samples (water, soil, etc.), researchers can identify the species present without directly observing the organisms.  This technique is particularly useful for detecting rare or elusive species.


Statement 3 is correct. eDNA data is increasingly being used to inform conservation efforts.  The information derived from eDNA analysis can contribute to the IUCN Red List assessments, helping to determine the conservation status of species, identify areas of high biodiversity, and monitor the effectiveness of conservation measures.


Statement 1 is incorrect. eDNA is not limited to aquatic environments. Although it is frequently used in aquatic systems, eDNA analysis is also applied in terrestrial ecosystems.  The method is versatile and applicable to a wide range of habitats.  The ability to detect eDNA in various environments has expanded the scope of biodiversity monitoring and species detection.


**8. With reference to Speciation, consider the following statements:**

1. Speciation is the process by which new species are formed through geographic isolation only.
2.  Sympatric speciation involves the formation of new species within the same geographic area, even without physical barriers.
3. Peripatric speciation refers to the formation of new species from a small, isolated population at the edge of a larger population's range.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Sympatric speciation is a mode of speciation where new species arise within the same geographic area, without the need for geographic isolation.  This can occur through mechanisms such as reproductive isolation, where different groups within a population evolve distinct mating preferences or reproductive incompatibilities, leading to the emergence of separate species.


Statement 3 is correct. Peripatric speciation is a form of speciation that occurs when a small population becomes isolated at the periphery of a larger population's range.  This isolated population, often subjected to different selective pressures, may diverge genetically from the parent population, eventually leading to the formation of a new species.  This is often considered a special case of allopatric speciation.


Statement 1 is incorrect. Speciation is not limited to geographic isolation. While allopatric speciation (geographic isolation) is a common mechanism, other modes of speciation, such as sympatric and parapatric speciation, can also lead to the formation of new species without complete geographic separation.  The various modes of speciation reflect the diversity of evolutionary processes that contribute to biodiversity.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), established in 2010, aims to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2030 to support developing countries in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
2. The Adaptation Fund, established in 2001, receives a 5% share of proceeds from the new market-based UNFCCC mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement.
3. The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), established in 2001, assists Least Developed Country Parties in formulating and implementing National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) and is administered by the World Bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The GCF's target was to mobilize US$100 billion annually by 2020, not 2030.  While the goal wasn't met, the fund continues to operate and support developing nations.  Statement 2 is correct; the Adaptation Fund does receive a 5% share of proceeds from Article 6.4 mechanisms. Statement 3 is incorrect. The LDCF, established in 2001, is indeed administered by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), not the World Bank.  The GEF is a partnership organisation that works with the UN and other bodies.  Therefore, only statements 1 (with the correction of the year) and 2 are accurate.
