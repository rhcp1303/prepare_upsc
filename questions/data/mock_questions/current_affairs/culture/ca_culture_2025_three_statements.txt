Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Zabt system, a significant revenue assessment method used in the Mughal Empire, was primarily implemented in fertile and well-organized agricultural regions. This system involved a detailed survey of land and crops to determine the revenue demand.  It was a departure from earlier revenue systems and aimed at a more efficient and equitable collection of land revenue.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the Jagir system, while often hereditary in practice, was fundamentally a system where land grants were given in exchange for military or administrative service. The grant was conditional upon the Jagirdar fulfilling their obligations to the emperor. Statement 3 is also incorrect. Mughal emperors, particularly during their zenith, exercised considerable influence over the economic affairs of the empire. They implemented various policies impacting trade, agriculture, and industry.  Their involvement ranged from regulating markets to promoting specific industries.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Indian economy, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the fundamental nature of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).  It is indeed a consumption-based tax, meaning the final consumer bears the tax burden.  This is a crucial aspect distinguishing it from other indirect tax systems. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GST aimed to simplify the tax structure and reduce the overall tax burden over time, its introduction did not result in an immediate and significant decrease.  The impact on businesses and consumers varied across sectors and regions, and the transition period involved adjustments and complexities. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While the GST Council plays a central role in shaping GST policy and providing a framework for its implementation, the actual enforcement and administration rest with the state and central tax authorities. The council's role is primarily advisory and coordinating, not directly executive in nature.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RBI has primary responsibility for monetary policy, the government does have influence, particularly through the appointment of the RBI governor and the overall economic policy framework.  The government and the RBI interact and coordinate on various economic decisions. Statement 2 is incorrect. NBFCs are not regulated by SEBI.  Different regulatory bodies oversee NBFCs depending on their activities and the nature of their business. The RBI is the primary regulator for many NBFCs. Statement 3 is incorrect. Public sector banks in India are not wholly owned by the central government. The government holds a majority stake, but there may be other shareholders, including public financial institutions. The ownership structure can vary slightly from bank to bank. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**4. With reference to India's foreign trade policy, consider the following statements:**

1. India's export-oriented policies primarily focus on promoting agricultural products, neglecting other sectors.

3.  Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in India are exclusively established to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While agriculture is a significant part of India's export sector, the export-oriented policies are not limited solely to agriculture.  India actively promotes exports across various sectors, including manufacturing, services, and technology. Statement 2 is incorrect. A consistent trade surplus is not the primary aim of India's foreign trade policy. The policy strives for a balanced and sustainable trade pattern that benefits the overall economy. While increasing exports is important, the emphasis is not solely on achieving a surplus, but rather on promoting competitiveness and diversifying trade relationships. Statement 3 is incorrect. SEZs are established to attract both domestic and foreign investment, promote exports, and generate employment.  While FDI is a significant component, it is not the exclusive focus of SEZs.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indian banking system.  Statement 1 is correct because Scheduled Commercial Banks are mandated to maintain a specific percentage of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) as CRR with the RBI.  This is a crucial tool for monetary policy. Statement 2 is correct. The SLR is indeed the minimum percentage of NDTL that banks must maintain as liquid assets, which includes government securities, cash, and gold.  This ensures banks have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligations. Statement 3 is correct. The Repo Rate is the rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks, primarily through repurchase agreements, for short-term liquidity management.  This is a key instrument used by the RBI to influence interest rates in the economy. Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**6. With reference to the concept of inflation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply at the current price level.
2.  Cost-push inflation is primarily driven by increases in the supply of money in the economy.
3.  Hyperinflation is a period of extremely high and accelerating inflation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes demand-pull inflation.  When aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) outpaces aggregate supply (total goods and services available), prices tend to rise, leading to inflation.  This is a classic macroeconomic concept. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Cost-push inflation is primarily driven by increases in production costs, such as wages or raw material prices, which are then passed on to consumers through higher prices. An increase in the money supply is more associated with demand-pull inflation. Statement 3 is correct.  Hyperinflation is characterized by extremely rapid and uncontrollable increases in the price level, often eroding the value of currency very quickly.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**7. With reference to the functioning of the Indian financial markets, consider the following statements:**

1. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the primary regulator for the stock markets in India.
2. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are the only two stock exchanges operating in India.
3.  The RBI plays no role in regulating the activities of stock exchanges in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SEBI is the primary regulatory body for the securities market in India, including stock exchanges. It oversees the functioning of stock exchanges, protects investor interests, and promotes fair trading practices. Statement 2 is incorrect. While NSE and BSE are the largest and most prominent stock exchanges in India, there are other recognized stock exchanges operating in the country.  The number and specific names might vary over time. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While SEBI is the primary regulator for stock exchanges, the RBI does play a supporting role, particularly in relation to monetary policy and overall financial stability.  The RBI's actions can indirectly affect the stock market. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**8. With reference to India's tax system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Direct taxes include income tax and corporate tax, and are levied directly on the income of individuals and corporations.
2.  Indirect taxes, such as Goods and Services Tax (GST), are levied on the sale or consumption of goods and services, and are ultimately borne by the consumer.
3.  The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is responsible for the administration and collection of indirect taxes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines direct taxes. They are levied directly on the income of individuals and corporations.  This is a fundamental distinction from indirect taxes. Statement 2 is also correct. Indirect taxes are levied on the sale or consumption of goods and services. While businesses initially collect these taxes, the ultimate burden rests on consumers. Statement 3 is incorrect. The CBDT is responsible for the administration and collection of *direct* taxes, not indirect taxes. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) handles the administration and collection of indirect taxes.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**9. With reference to the concept of fiscal policy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending and/or reducing taxes to stimulate economic activity.
2.  Contractionary fiscal policy is implemented during periods of high inflation to curb economic growth.
3.  Fiscal policy is exclusively controlled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes expansionary fiscal policy.  It aims to boost economic activity by increasing government spending (e.g., infrastructure projects) and/or reducing taxes to increase disposable income.  This is a key tool used during economic downturns. Statement 2 is also correct. Contractionary fiscal policy is used during periods of high inflation to cool down the economy.  This involves reducing government spending and/or increasing taxes to reduce aggregate demand. Statement 3 is incorrect. Fiscal policy, which deals with government spending and taxation, is under the purview of the government, not the RBI. The RBI focuses on monetary policy. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**10. With reference to the balance of payments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The current account of the balance of payments records transactions related to the export and import of goods and services.
2.  The capital account of the balance of payments includes foreign direct investment and portfolio investment.
3.  A balance of payments surplus always indicates a strong and healthy economy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The current account of the balance of payments records transactions related to the export and import of goods and services, as well as income from investments and transfers. This is a key component of the balance of payments. Statement 2 is also correct. The capital account includes transactions related to capital flows, such as foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investment (e.g., buying stocks and bonds), and loans. Statement 3 is incorrect. While a balance of payments surplus can be a positive sign, it does not always indicate a strong and healthy economy.  Other factors, such as the composition of the surplus (e.g., is it driven by excessive borrowing?) and the overall economic conditions, need to be considered.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories significantly expanded Chola influence across the Bay of Bengal, including conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2. Rajendra Chola I's campaign extended Chola power to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, marking a peak of Chola naval dominance.
3. The Chola navy primarily utilized small, lightly armed vessels unsuitable for long-distance voyages and large-scale battles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the significant naval expansions of the Chola Empire under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I. Rajaraja I's conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, along with his destruction of the Chera navy, established Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal. Rajendra I's expeditions to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra further extended this influence, showcasing the empire's formidable naval capabilities and reach.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chola navy was sophisticated for its time, capable of undertaking long-distance voyages and engaging in large-scale naval battles.  Archaeological evidence and contemporary accounts depict the use of larger, well-equipped ships designed for both trade and warfare.  Their naval prowess was instrumental in establishing and maintaining the Chola Empire's extensive maritime trade network and overseas territories.  The scale of their conquests would not have been possible with an inferior navy.


**2. With reference to Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance, the seasonal migration of pastoral communities with their livestock, is primarily confined to the Himalayan region of India.
2.  The practice involves moving livestock to higher altitude pastures during the summer months and lower altitude plains during winter. This practice is solely driven by climatic conditions and has no socio-economic implications.
3.  Nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are the only communities engaging in transhumance in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it's also practiced in other parts of India, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts. First, it is an oversimplification of the practice. While climate is a major driver, socio-economic factors such as access to markets, grazing rights, and social interactions are also intertwined with the seasonal movements. Second, the statement wrongly claims the practice is devoid of socio-economic implications. Transhumance is intricately linked to the livelihoods and social structures of the participating communities. Statement 3 is also incorrect because various other pastoral communities, besides those mentioned, practice transhumance across different regions of India.  The practice is more widespread and diverse than the statement suggests.


**3. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument solely on its physical untraceability, irrespective of historical significance.
2.  The delisting process under the AMASR Act, 1958, involves a rigorous assessment of the monument's national importance, considering various factors beyond mere physical location.
3. Monuments delisted by the ASI are automatically transferred to the respective state governments for protection and conservation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI's decision to delist a monument isn't solely based on untraceability.  While untraceability is a factor, the assessment also considers the monument's historical significance, architectural merit, and overall national importance.  The process involves a detailed evaluation and report, often involving expert opinions. Statement 2 is correct.  The AMASR Act, 1958, empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that cease to be of national importance. This assessment is done through a documented process involving various factors.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Delisting under the AMASR Act doesn't automatically transfer the monument to state governments.  The legal status and responsibility for the site's protection and conservation may change after delisting, but it's not an automatic transfer to state authorities.  The process and subsequent management depend on various legal and administrative considerations.


**4. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government initiative aimed at promoting the export of Indian cotton by leveraging blockchain technology for traceability and certification.
2. The initiative exclusively involves the Ministry of Textiles and Cotton Corporation of India, excluding private sector participation.
3. The primary objective of Kasturi Cotton Bharat is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by establishing stringent quality control measures and branding strategies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat utilizes blockchain technology for traceability and certification, aiming to boost exports by assuring consumers of the cotton's origin and quality.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, various trade bodies, and the private sector. It is not exclusively a government undertaking.  Statement 3 is correct.  The core goal of Kasturi Cotton Bharat is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.  This is done by building brand recognition, improving traceability, and establishing quality standards, thus increasing its appeal in the international market.  The initiative seeks to create a sustainable ecosystem for Indian cotton.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure relied heavily on a decentralized system of governance, with minimal central authority exercised by the Raya (king).
2.  The Amara-Nayakas, powerful military commanders, were granted territories to administer but retained complete autonomy and independence from the central government.
3. Krishnadevaraya's reign marked a period of significant territorial expansion for the Vijayanagara Empire, including conquests in the Raichur doab and parts of Orissa.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire did utilize a decentralized system to some extent, employing Amara-Nayakas to govern territories, the Raya (king) still held significant central authority. The system wasn't completely decentralized; the Raya maintained control over key aspects of governance and the military. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas, though granted territories, were not completely autonomous. They were accountable to the Raya and had to pay taxes and maintain military forces. Their power was subject to the control of the central government.  Statement 3 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign was a high point for the Vijayanagara Empire, marked by considerable territorial expansion through military conquests in the Raichur doab and parts of Orissa.  His reign represents a period of significant growth and power for the empire.


**6. With reference to the outcome of the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha directly resulted in the immediate and complete abolition of untouchability in Travancore.
2.  The Satyagraha led to legal reforms, including the Temple Entry Proclamation, granting access to lower-caste individuals into temples in Travancore.
3.  The Vaikom Satyagraha was solely a Hindu reformist movement and did not contribute to broader anti-caste struggles in South India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha didn't lead to the immediate and complete abolition of untouchability. While it was a significant step, the complete eradication of untouchability was a gradual and complex process.  Statement 2 is correct. The Satyagraha was instrumental in bringing about legal reforms, including the Temple Entry Proclamation, which granted access to temples for lower-caste individuals. This was a significant victory for the movement.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha had a broader impact than just Hindu reform.  It contributed to the larger anti-caste movements in South India, highlighting the injustices faced by lower castes and prompting further struggles for social justice and equality.  It influenced and intertwined with other anti-caste movements of the time.


**7. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, carried out by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), primarily aimed at assassinating key British officials.
2.  The robbery of the British Indian Government treasury during the Kakori Train Action directly funded the HRA's extensive military operations against the British Raj.
3.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were among the key figures involved in the Kakori Train Action.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The primary aim of the Kakori Train Action was not assassination but the robbery of the British treasury to fund revolutionary activities. While the possibility of encountering British officials was present, the primary goal was financial. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the robbery aimed to provide funds, it did not directly fund extensive military operations against the British Raj. The funds obtained were used to support the HRA's revolutionary activities but on a smaller scale. Statement 3 is correct. Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were prominent figures involved in planning and executing the Kakori Train Action.  They played crucial roles in this landmark event of the Indian independence movement.


**8. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Padma Awards are conferred only on living individuals, with no exceptions for posthumous awards.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is the highest civilian award in India, followed by the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri.
3.  Recipients of Padma Awards are granted titles that can be used as prefixes or suffixes to their names.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Padma Awards are typically not conferred posthumously, there have been exceptions in highly deserving cases.  The government can make an exception in rare circumstances. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award in India, followed by Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.  The order of precedence is crucial to understand the ranking of these prestigious awards. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Padma Awards do not confer titles that can be used as prefixes or suffixes to names.  The awards are recognitions of distinguished service and do not come with titular designations.


**9. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest gallantry award conferred during wartime, followed by the Ashoka Chakra, which is awarded for peacetime bravery.
2.  The Gallantry Awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.
3.  The Kirti Chakra and Vir Chakra are awarded for acts of conspicuous bravery in the face of the enemy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest gallantry award for wartime bravery, while the Ashoka Chakra is the highest for peacetime bravery.  This distinction is important in understanding the hierarchy of these awards. Statement 2 is incorrect. Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year—once on Republic Day and again on Independence Day. The timing of the announcements is significant.  Statement 3 is correct. The Kirti Chakra and Vir Chakra are indeed awarded for acts of conspicuous bravery or valour in the face of the enemy.  These awards recognize specific acts of courage and sacrifice during combat.


**10. With reference to the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register is exclusively for manuscripts written in the Sanskrit language.
2. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
3. The MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts from various languages and literary traditions, not limited to Sanskrit. The inclusion of works in diverse languages reflects the program's broader scope.  Statement 2 is correct. The 10th meeting of MOWCAP was indeed held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, as stated in the provided text.  The location of the meeting is a significant piece of information.  Statement 3 is correct. The MOW Programme does maintain three registers: International, Regional, and National, reflecting the program's multi-tiered structure.  Knowing the structure of the MOW Programme is important for understanding its operation.


**1. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative is solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles, without involvement from other stakeholders.
2.  Blockchain technology is employed to ensure complete traceability and certification of Kasturi Cotton.
3.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is responsible for implementing the initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  It's not a solely Ministry of Textiles driven project.  Statement 2 is correct; blockchain technology is a core component of the initiative, ensuring traceability and certification from farm to market.  Statement 3 is also correct; TEXPROCIL is the designated implementing agency for the project. The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1 and the correct identification of the roles of blockchain and TEXPROCIL.  Understanding the collaborative nature of the initiative and the specific technological and organizational components is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of Kasturi Cotton Bharat's structure and implementation.


**2. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a collaboration between the Ministry of Culture, Lalit Kala Akademi, and the National Museum.
2. The project aims to promote art appreciation by creating public installations in rural landscapes.
3.  The artworks featured in Project PARI primarily focus on contemporary styles, excluding traditional Indian art forms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the project involves Lalit Kala Akademi and National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum. Statement 2 is incorrect as the project focuses on urban landscapes, not rural ones.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the project explicitly includes various traditional Indian art forms such as Thangka, Cheriyal, Bani Thani, and Alpana paintings, demonstrating a diverse representation of Indian artistic heritage.  Therefore, none of the statements are accurate representations of Project PARI's key features and objectives.  This highlights the need for precise understanding of the project's implementing agencies, location focus, and artistic scope.


**3. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based solely on the assessment by its own internal committee, without external input.
2.  Monuments facing delisting are those categorized as "missing monuments" according to the AMASR Act, 1958.
3.  Once delisted, a monument loses its protection under the AMASR Act, 1958, allowing for construction activities in the area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The decision to delist is based on a report from the Ministry of Culture, not solely on the ASI's internal assessment.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "missing monuments" is not officially recognized within the AMASR Act; it was a term used by the CAG Audit team.  Statement 3 is correct. Delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act removes ASI protection and opens the area to regular construction and urbanization. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the decision-making process and the legal basis for delisting, emphasizing the need to understand the precise legal framework and the roles of different agencies involved in the process.


**4. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Padma Awards are typically conferred posthumously, except in rare cases.
2. The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Shri is for exceptional and distinguished service.
3.  Recipients of Padma Awards are granted a title that can be used as a suffix or prefix to their names.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Padma Awards are normally *not* conferred posthumously, although exceptions can be made. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Bhushan is for distinguished service of a high order. The Padma Shri is for distinguished service. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Padma Awards do not confer titles; they are honours, not titles to be used with a name. Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the facts surrounding the Padma Awards. This question highlights the importance of precise knowledge of the award criteria and the nature of the honour bestowed.


**5. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
2. The awards are based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. Statement 2 is correct; the awards are indeed based on the experiences shared on the Anubhav Portal. Statement 3 is partially correct in that the aim includes fostering good governance and administrative reforms, but "improving efficiency of government services" is a narrower interpretation of the broader aim of learning from past experiences for future improvements.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct. The question tests the knowledge of the awarding body and the precise objectives of the Anubhav Awards program.


**6. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ashoka Chakra was instituted before the Param Vir Chakra.
2.  The Vir Chakra is a wartime gallantry award, while the Shaurya Chakra is a peacetime gallantry award.
3.  Gallantry awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Param Vir Chakra (wartime) was instituted in 1950, while the Ashoka Chakra (peacetime) was instituted in 1952. Statement 2 is correct; Vir Chakra is a wartime award, and Shaurya Chakra is a peacetime award (though both are now under the umbrella of Ashoka Chakra).  Statement 3 is incorrect; gallantry awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. The question tests knowledge of the chronology of institution of these awards and their classification based on wartime and peacetime gallantry.


**7. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" and are administered by the Central Board of Film Certification.
2. Awards are given only in the category of Feature Films.
3. The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is presented alongside the National Film Awards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that they were initially called State Awards, but they are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Central Board of Film Certification. Statement 2 is incorrect; awards are given across three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema. Statement 3 is correct. The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is indeed presented along with the National Film Awards.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  The question highlights the need for accurate recall of the administrative body and the scope of award categories.


**8. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The award is granted biennially, alternating between architectural and urban design projects.
2. Projects must demonstrate innovation, creativity, and reflect local heritage.
3.  The award primarily focuses on large-scale infrastructure projects, such as airports and stadiums.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the award is granted annually, not biennially.  Statement 2 is correct; innovation, creativity, and reflection of local heritage are key criteria for consideration.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while large-scale projects are included, the award encompasses a broader range of categories, including museums, hotels, and restaurants,  not just large-scale infrastructure.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. The question tests the knowledge of the frequency of the award, the selection criteria, and the range of project types considered.


**9. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University was established under the Nalanda University Act, 2007.
2. The university's curriculum primarily focused on Buddhist philosophy and religious studies.
3.  The ancient Nalanda University was known for its extensive library, called “Dharma Gunj” or “Mountain of Truth.”

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the university was established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010, not 2007. While the decision to establish it originated from the 2007 EAS summit, the act of establishment is dated 2010.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while Buddhist studies were significant, the ancient Nalanda University offered a broad range of subjects including Vedas, various schools of Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and warfare strategy. Statement 3 is correct; the ancient university possessed a vast library known as “Dharma Gunj” or “Mountain of Truth.”  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The question tests the knowledge of the establishment act, the diversity of the curriculum, and the name of the library.


**10. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act defines the term "Missing Monuments" and outlines procedures for their recovery.
2.  The Act empowers the Central Government to declare monuments of national importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act does not define "Missing Monuments"—this term was used by the CAG.

Statement 2 is also correct. The initiative specifically focuses on training women and youth to create new tourism-related products and experiences, such as food tours and craft tours, thereby empowering local communities and diversifying tourism offerings.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The initiative is launched by the Ministry of Tourism, not the Ministry of Culture, and it's implemented across 50, not 100, tourist destinations in India.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is a joint initiative of Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, and it encompasses various art forms, including paintings and murals, not just sculptures. This distractor plays on the potential assumption that a project with "public art" in the title would primarily focus on large-scale installations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The project focuses on urban, not rural, landscapes, aiming to transform urban spaces into accessible art galleries. This is a crucial detail that differentiates Project PARI from other rural development initiatives.

Statement 3 is correct. The project does indeed include traditional Indian art forms like Thangka painting (Sikkim/Ladakh), Cheriyal painting (Telangana), Bani Thani Painting (Rajasthan), and Alpana art (Tripura), showcasing India's diverse artistic heritage.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is indeed a premium quality cotton brand using blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification, enhancing its global competitiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, it's a joint initiative of the Ministry of Textiles, various trade bodies, and the industry.  The aim is to enhance global competitiveness, not necessarily reduce costs directly, although that could be an indirect benefit.  This distractor plays on the assumption that government initiatives always aim for cost reduction.

Statement 3 is correct. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency for this initiative.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the origins of the concept of Justice can be traced to Greek and Roman mythology, the specific depiction of Lady Justice with a blindfold emerged during the Renaissance, not in ancient Greece. This is a chronologically misleading statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The scales represent weighing evidence and impartiality, while the sword symbolizes the power of judgment and the enforcement of law.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The blindfold, symbolizing impartiality, was added during the Renaissance period (14th century), as a commentary on the then-corrupt legal systems, and was later reinterpreted during the Enlightenment as representing impartiality.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary aim of these corridor projects is to improve accessibility to the temples and enhance the overall experience for pilgrims and tourists.  This aligns with the broader goal of boosting religious tourism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The projects are inspired by the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor in Varanasi, not the Ayodhya Ram Temple Corridor.  This is a crucial factual difference that would distinguish those familiar with the details of these different projects.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vishnupad Temple is located in Gaya, not Bodh Gaya, and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, not Lord Shiva. This statement contains multiple factual errors, making it a strong distractor.


**7. With reference to the delisting of monuments by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The decision to delist monuments is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The assessment also considers whether the monument lacks national importance, not solely its historical significance. This plays on the potential confusion between ministries responsible for cultural heritage and national security.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "missing monuments" is not officially used in the AMASR Act, 1958. It originated from a CAG audit report.  This highlights the difference between official legal terminology and informal usage.

Statement 3 is correct. Delisting under the AMASR Act, 1958, does indeed remove the ASI's responsibility for conservation, protection, and maintenance of the monument.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The agreement does allow visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Pakistani Sikhs do not have reciprocal access to the corridor and require an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India. This highlights the asymmetrical nature of the agreement.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The agreement does not restrict the corridor's use to Sikh pilgrims only; it is open to people of all faiths.  This is a detail that might be overlooked by those with a limited understanding of the agreement's scope.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I significantly expanded the Chola Empire's naval power, establishing dominance over the Bay of Bengal, which allowed for flourishing trade with Southeast Asia.

Statement 2 is correct. Nagapattinam was a crucial trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating extensive trade with Southeast Asian countries.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because Padma Awards are not *only* given posthumously; while they are normally not conferred posthumously, exceptions are made in highly deserving cases.  Statement 2 reverses the descriptions of Padma Vibhushan and Padma Shri.  The Padma Vibhushan is for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri is for distinguished service of a high order.  Statement 3 is false; the award does not amount to a title and cannot be used as a suffix or prefix to a name.  The options are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the award criteria, highlighting potential misconceptions about the posthumous nature of the award and the hierarchy of the different Padma Awards.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The core purpose of the Anubhav Awards is indeed to foster good governance and administrative reforms based on the shared experiences of retiring employees (Statement 3 is correct).  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific awarding body and the eligibility criteria for the Anubhav Awards.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Param Vir Chakra is a *wartime* gallantry award, instituted in 1950, not a peacetime award instituted in 1967 (Statement 1 is incorrect). The Ashoka Chakra was initially instituted with three classes which were later renamed as Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra in 1967 (Statement 2 is correct). Gallantry awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day (Statement 3 is incorrect).

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1973, and were initially called 'State Awards' (Statement 1 is incorrect).  Awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema (Statement 2 is incorrect). The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973, not 1954 (Statement 3 is incorrect).  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the history and administrative structure of the National Film Awards, emphasizing the importance of precise factual recall.

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

The delisting process is indeed governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958 (Statement 2 is correct).  Delisting removes ASI protection, allowing for construction and other activities (Statement 3 is correct).

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja Chola's naval victories are well-documented, but the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai is not consistently supported by historical evidence. While he did engage in naval conflicts with the Pandyas, the specific battle at Kandalursalai requires further corroboration from primary sources.  The source primarily mentions his destruction of the Chera navy.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's extensive naval campaigns are historically well-established. His expeditions reached the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly expanding Chola influence in Southeast Asia.  This expansion is supported by various epigraphic and archaeological findings.

Statement 3 is correct.  Rajendra Chola I's successful naval campaigns against Sri Lanka led to the island's complete annexation as a Chola province. This is a well-documented event in Chola history, supported by inscriptions and historical accounts.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Transhumance is indeed prevalent in the Himalayas, with various nomadic pastoralist communities engaging in this practice. The mentioned tribes are key examples of those involved in seasonal livestock migration.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Himalayas are a significant region for transhumance in India, this practice also exists in the plains of several states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly restricts the practice to the Himalayas.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative did recognize two European transhumance traditions in 2023, there's no mention of specific recognition being given to Indian transhumance traditions in that year.  The initiative focuses on global transhumance practices, but the statement incorrectly claims specific recognition for India in 2023.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, included manuscripts of only Indian literary works in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
2. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 10th meeting of MOWCAP included manuscripts from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, not solely from India.  The inclusion of Indian works is accurate, but the statement presents a false exclusivity.

Statement 2 is correct. The MOW Programme, established in 1992, indeed maintains three registers—International, Regional, and National—to document and preserve significant documentary heritage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the mentioned works were included, the statement wrongly implies that these are the *only* three Indian works included.  Other Indian literary works were also likely part of the register.  The statement presents a false limitation.


**4. With reference to Sangameshwar Temples in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar temple in Nandyal district (Andhra Pradesh) is uniquely situated at the confluence of only the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers.
2.  All Sangameshwar temples in India are dedicated to Lord Shiva and are architecturally identical.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar temple in Nandyal is situated at the confluence of the Krishna River and *five* other tributaries (Bhavanasi, Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi, and Malapaharini), not just two. The statement incorrectly limits the number of rivers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many Sangameshwar temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva, their architectural styles can vary depending on the regional influence and the time period of construction.  The statement incorrectly assumes architectural uniformity.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sangameshwar temple in Karnataka is indeed part of the Pattadakal group of monuments, which holds UNESCO World Heritage Site status. This fact is well-documented.


**5. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple in Assam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya and is celebrated at the beginning of the monsoon season.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ambubachi Mela at the Kamakhya temple celebrates the annual menstruation of the Goddess and is indeed timed to coincide with the monsoon season. This is a central aspect of the festival.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kala Pahar did destroy the original temple, and a reconstruction occurred in the mid-16th century under the Koch dynasty, the architectural style wasn't exclusively Nilachal.  The reconstruction incorporated elements of Upper Burma, Pala style of Bengal, and later evolved into the Ahom style, demonstrating a blend of influences.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Kamakhya temple's location on the Nilachal hills is accurate. However, it *is* considered one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, significant sites associated with the goddess Shakti.  The statement wrongly denies this important status.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization's trade and commerce, consider the following statements:**

1. Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as Meluha, and mention only one intermediate trading station, Dilmun (Bahrain).
2. The Indus Valley Civilization's exports primarily consisted of precious stones and thin copper.
3. The use of standardized weights and measures is evidence of a sophisticated system of internal and foreign trade in the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mesopotamian records do refer to the Indus region as Meluha and mention *two* intermediate trading stations: Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast). The statement incorrectly reduces the number of stations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While precious stones were exported, the primary exports of the Indus Valley Civilization included grains, jewelry, and pottery, not thin copper which was imported. The statement incorrectly lists exports and imports.

Statement 3 is correct. The discovery of standardized weights and measures across the Indus Valley Civilization is strong evidence of a well-organized and extensive trading network, both internal and external.  This points to advanced economic organization.


**7. With reference to the Lothal archaeological site and the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme solely through government funding.
2. Lothal, located between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambat, is not considered a significant city of the Indus Valley Civilization.
3. The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides insights into the Indus Valley Civilization's understanding of tides, winds, and other nautical factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme using a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, not solely through government funding. The statement incorrectly describes the funding mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lothal is indeed a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization, known for its sophisticated urban planning and its significance in maritime trade.  The statement incorrectly downplays its importance.

Statement 3 is correct. The discovery of a man-made dry dock at Lothal offers valuable insights into the advanced knowledge of maritime technology, including understanding of tides, winds, and navigation, possessed by the Indus Valley Civilization.  This is a well-established archaeological finding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War (261 BCE) was a significant event leading to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, it did not result in the complete destruction of Kalinga's army or infrastructure. The statement presents an exaggeration of the war's impact.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela's patronage of Jainism is well-documented, and the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves serve as evidence of this patronage. These caves contain numerous Jain sculptures and inscriptions.

Statement 3 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription, written in Brahmi script, provides valuable information about Kharavela's reign, including his military campaigns and cultural activities.  It's a key primary source for understanding the Kalinga Dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site, but the statement incorrectly states that its rock art features *only* humans and weapons. The description of the art needs further clarification and may be incomplete.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rock art sites at Damaratogu in Gundala mandal are mentioned, but the statement incorrectly asserts that they *predominantly* depict human figures engaged in warfare.  The actual content of the rock art requires further study and may not show warfare scenes.

Statement 3 is correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a common type of megalithic monument found in the region of Devarlabanda Mula. This is a well-known characteristic of the area's megalithic tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's zenith is generally associated with the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Saluva Dynasty.  The Saluva Dynasty was a transitional phase.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign was a period of significant expansion and military success for the Vijayanagara Empire. His achievements included the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and victories against the Sultan of Bijapur.  These are well-documented events.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 'Amaram' and 'Bhandaravada' lands were indeed under the ultimate authority of the Raya, but they were significantly administered by the Amara-Nayakas, who were granted territories and collected taxes from them.  The statement incorrectly claims direct royal control without acknowledging the role of the Amara-Nayakas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton is indeed a premium quality Indian cotton with 100% traceability and certification facilitated by blockchain technology. However, it's not solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles; it's a joint initiative involving the Ministry, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  The involvement of multiple stakeholders is a key aspect of the initiative's design.

Statement 2 is correct. The aim of the initiative is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through self-regulation in branding, traceability, and certification, thereby creating a sustainable ecosystem. TEXPROCIL is accurately identified as the implementing agency.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the initiative empowers ginners, it doesn't extend to *all* ginners indiscriminately.  There are likely quality standards and participation requirements that ginners must meet to be part of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand. The statement oversimplifies the selection criteria for participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Project PARI is a Ministry of Culture initiative and aims to transform urban landscapes into accessible art galleries, it's not solely executed by the National Gallery of Modern Art. Lalit Kala Akademi is also a key executing partner.  The statement omits a crucial implementing body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the project does involve over 150 artists and includes traditional art forms like Thangka painting, it's inaccurate to say it *primarily* focuses on them.  The project likely encompasses a wide range of contemporary and traditional art forms. The statement overemphasizes a specific aspect of the project.

Statement 3 is correct. The first intervention is indeed in Delhi, aiming to democratize art through accessible public installations. This aligns with the project's core objective.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, not the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The year of the earthquake is a critical detail.

While Gandhiji was aware of and expressed support for the movement, he didn't play a direct leading role in its organization.  The key leaders were T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, not 2015, and it coincides with the Summer Solstice, not the Winter Solstice. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The text states that the resolution was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 member states; the number in the question is close enough to be considered a plausible distractor.

Statement 3 is largely correct. The text states that seals and fossil remains from the Indus Valley Civilization suggest yoga's prevalence in ancient India, although the date is slightly different (2700 BC in the text).  The slight variation makes this a challenging statement to evaluate.


**5.  With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India upon the recommendation of a dedicated selection committee.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a monetary grant alongside the Sanad (certificate) and medallion.
3.  The award recognizes outstanding contributions across various fields, including literature, science, and public service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that while the President grants the award, the recommendation comes from the Prime Minister, not a dedicated selection committee.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the award does *not* come with a monetary grant.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly mentions that the Bharat Ratna is awarded for outstanding service across any field.



These examples demonstrate the creation of challenging MCQs that require detailed factual recall,  test analytical skills, and incorporate plausible distractors to assess a candidate's understanding of the topics.  The remaining text sections did not provide sufficient detailed information to construct MCQs of comparable difficulty and adherence to all criteria.


**1. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat at the Battle of Mahidpur led to the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly altering the Holkars' relationship with the British.
2.  The Holkar Dynasty was a part of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside prominent members like the Bhonsle of Nagpur and the Gaekwad of Baroda.
3.  Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw the flourishing of the Maheswari weaving industry, with Maheswar sarees gaining recognition as a Geographical Indication (GI) product.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's history.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Battle of Mahidpur and the subsequent Treaty of Mandsaur as a turning point in the Holkars' relationship with the British, marking a shift in power dynamics. Statement 2 accurately places the Holkar Dynasty within the broader context of the Maratha Confederacy, listing other significant ruling houses.  Statement 3 correctly highlights Ahilyabai Holkar's contribution to the economic development of her region, fostering the Maheswari weaving industry and its subsequent GI tag recognition. There are no factual inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. With reference to ancient Indian universities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vikramshila University, known for its association with renowned scholars like Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu, was located in present-day Bihar.
2.  Nagarjunakonda University, named after the influential Mahayana Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, was a prominent center for Buddhist studies in ancient Andhra Pradesh.
3.  Odantapuri University, established in the 8th century by the Pala ruler Gopal I, rivaled Nalanda in its significance as a center for Buddhist learning, particularly in Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Vikramshila University was indeed a significant center of learning in Bihar, and its association with Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu is well-documented.  Similarly, Nagarjunakonda's importance as a Buddhist center in Andhra Pradesh, linked to Nagarjuna, is historically established. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Odantapuri was a significant university established by Gopal I, it did not rival Nalanda in the same way Ratnagiri did. Ratnagiri is often mentioned alongside Nalanda and Vikramshila as a major Buddhist university. The statement incorrectly attributes this position to Odantapuri.


**3. With reference to the contributions of Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, born in a Brahmin family in Murbad, Thane district, Maharashtra, was heavily influenced by the philanthropist Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate descriptions of Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's life and contributions.  Statement 1 correctly details his family background, birthplace, and the influence of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy on his philanthropic endeavors. Statement 2 accurately reflects his significant contributions to education, especially for girls, through land donations.  Statement 3 is also correct, highlighting his role in shaping Bombay's urban landscape through architectural planning and development.  The information presented in all statements is factually sound and reflects his known contributions.


**4. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's architecture exemplifies the Kalinga style, a substyle of Nagara architecture, featuring distinct components like the Vimana (Garbhagriha), Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa.
2. The Ratna Bhandar, the temple's sacred treasury, houses jewels belonging to the holy trinity of Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra, and was reopened after a long period of closure.
3. The temple was initially built during the reign of Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, the founder of the Ganga dynasty in the early 12th century, and later expanded upon.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the architectural style and its key components. Statement 2 accurately describes the Ratna Bhandar, its contents, and its recent reopening. Statement 3 correctly attributes the temple's initial construction to Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva and acknowledges subsequent expansions.  There is no contradictory or inaccurate information presented.


**5. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is annually submerged in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.
2.  The temple's location at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with five other tributaries, is the origin of its name, "Sangameswara."
3. Sangameshwar temples are exclusively found in Andhra Pradesh, reflecting the region's unique religious heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The Nandyal Sangameshwar Temple's dedication to Lord Shiva and its annual submersion are well-known facts. Its location at the confluence of rivers is also the reason for its name.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Sangameshwar temples are not limited to Andhra Pradesh; they exist in other states like Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, indicating a broader geographical distribution of this type of temple.


**6. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kamakhya Temple, located on the Nilachal hills in Assam, is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, believed to be the site where the reproductive organ of Goddess Sati fell.

3. The Ambubachi Mela, a significant festival commemorating the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, is celebrated at the temple, and its origins predate the Koch dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Kamakhya Temple's status as a Shakti Peetha and its unique architectural style, incorporating influences from different regions, are well-established facts. However, statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the Ambubachi Mela is celebrated at the temple and does commemorate the yearly menstruation of the Goddess, linking its origins to a period before the Koch dynasty's reconstruction is not definitively supported by historical evidence. The Koch dynasty played a significant role in the temple's reconstruction, but the festival's origins may be older.


**7. With reference to the Jyotirmath, consider the following statements:**

1. Jyotirmath, one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya, is located in Uttarakhand and serves as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath.
2.  Adi Shankaracharya is believed to have performed penance in Jyotirmath under a tree known as Amar Kalpavriksha, promoting Advaita Vedanta philosophy.
3. Jyotirmath is primarily known for its association with the Advaita Vedanta school of thought, but also serves as a base camp for mountaineers attempting to climb the Nanda Devi peak.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Jyotirmath's location, its status as one of Adi Shankaracharya's four mathas, and its function as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath. Statement 2 accurately describes the legend of Adi Shankaracharya's penance and the promotion of Advaita Vedanta. Statement 3 correctly notes both the philosophical significance of Jyotirmath and its role as a base camp for mountaineers.


**8. With reference to the Alagar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alagar Temple, situated on the foothills of the Alagar hills in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Lord Vishnu, worshipped here as Kallazhagar.
2. The temple's architecture showcases the Nayaka style, evident in the intricate carvings and pillared halls, and is mentioned in the Tamil epic Silappadikaram.
3. The Chithirai festival, culminating in the procession of Lord Kallazhagar back from the Vaigai river, is a significant event associated with the temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe the Alagar Temple. Statement 1 accurately identifies its location, dedication to Lord Vishnu (as Kallazhagar), and its inclusion among the 108 Divya Desams. Statement 2 correctly points out the architectural style and mentions its presence in the Silappadikaram. Statement 3 correctly describes the Chithirai festival and its association with the temple.


**9. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval power was instrumental in his conquests, including the destruction of the Chera navy and the annexation of parts of Sri Lanka.
2. Rajendra Chola I expanded the empire's reach significantly through naval expeditions, conquering regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3.  The Chola navy's dominance was primarily focused on the eastern coast of India, with limited expansion into the Bay of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval power and its role in territorial expansion. Rajaraja Chola I's naval victories are well-documented, and Rajendra Chola I's expeditions to Southeast Asia significantly expanded the empire's influence. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chola navy's influence extended far beyond the eastern coast of India and the Bay of Bengal, reaching as far as Southeast Asia.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure included the Amara-Nayakas, military commanders who governed territories and collected taxes, retaining a portion for their own use and maintaining temples and irrigation works.
2. The empire's land administration involved the 'Ayagar' system, where twelve functionaries were appointed by the government in each village, with their positions often becoming hereditary.
3.  Krishnadevaraya's reign witnessed significant territorial expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and defeats inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur, but the empire's zenith was under the Saluva dynasty.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Vijayanagara Empire's political and land administration systems. The Amara-Nayaka system and the Ayagar system are well-documented aspects of the empire's governance. However, statement 3 is partially incorrect. While Krishnadevaraya's reign did see significant territorial gains, the empire's zenith is generally attributed to the Tuluva dynasty, not the Saluva dynasty. The Saluva dynasty was a transitional period after the decline of the Sangama dynasty.


**11. With reference to the literary works mentioned, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas, an epic poem written in Awadhi by Goswami Tulsidas, is a poetic retelling of the Ramayana and consists of seven Kandas.

3.  Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, a text of Indian poetics written in Sanskrit by Abhinava Gupta, is known for its commentary on Acharya Anandvardhan's work.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is indeed a text of Indian poetics written in Sanskrit, it was authored by Acharya Anandavardhana, not Abhinava Gupta. Abhinava Gupta wrote a commentary *on* Anandavardhana's work.  The statement incorrectly attributes authorship to Abhinava Gupta.


**12. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National, aiming to preserve the world's documentary heritage.
2.  The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts were included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register in 2023, along with other works from the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. Statement 1 accurately describes the MoW Programme's structure and objectives. Statement 2 accurately states the inclusion of the specified Indian manuscripts in the regional register (though the year may need verification depending on the most up-to-date information). Statement 3 accurately highlights the significance of this inclusion in preserving and promoting Indian literary heritage.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the statements.


**13. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, inaugurated in 2022, commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale and was centered in Bhuj.
2. The museum is located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, near the Bhujio Fort, and features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.
3.  The Miyawaki method, employed in the museum's forest, involves planting a diverse range of non-native trees, promoting rapid growth and biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Miyawaki method emphasizes the planting of *native* trees to promote rapid growth and biodiversity,  not non-native species.  The use of non-native species would contradict the core principle of the Miyawaki method.


**14. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema, is presented annually and was instituted in 1969 to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary.
2.  The award includes a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize, and the amount of the cash prize has remained unchanged since its inception.
3.  The award is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, and notable recipients include Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, and Waheeda Rehman.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award's details, including its institution year, the presenting body, and some notable recipients, are accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The cash prize amount associated with the award is not static; it has likely changed over the years since its inception.  The statement incorrectly implies that it has remained constant.



**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Saluva dynasty ruled the empire after the Sangama dynasty's decline, and the Tuluva dynasty oversaw the empire's peak.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and significant victories against the Bijapur Sultan.
3. The Amara-Nayakas were appointed by the Raya and collected taxes, retaining a portion for personal use and maintaining temples and irrigation works.  The Ayagars, twelve functionaries, were appointed by the government in each village and their positions became hereditary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the succession of dynasties and the Tuluva dynasty's association with the empire's zenith. Statement 2 accurately describes key military and territorial achievements under Krishnadevaraya. Statement 3 correctly outlines the roles and functions of the Amara-Nayakas and the Ayagars within the empire's administrative structure.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.  The options are designed to test the candidate's complete understanding of the empire's political structure, military successes, and administrative organization.  Options (a), (b), and (d) act as distractors by testing partial knowledge of the subject matter.


**2. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. He primarily focused on promoting the Dvaita system of Vedanta philosophy, emphasizing the duality between the individual soul and the supreme being.
2. His 1893 address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago is widely recognized as a pivotal moment in introducing Indian spirituality to the West.
3. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, focusing primarily on monastic life and spiritual retreats, with limited involvement in social service initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Swami Vivekananda's Chicago address was indeed a landmark event that significantly impacted the global perception of Hinduism and Indian spirituality.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while he did engage with Vedanta philosophy, it was not solely focused on the Dvaita system; his teachings incorporated elements of Advaita and Vishishtadvaita as well.  Statement 3 is also inaccurate as the Ramakrishna Mission, established by Vivekananda, actively engaged in extensive social service work beyond monastic life, including running schools, hospitals, and other charitable institutions. The options are designed to test the candidate's detailed understanding of Vivekananda's multifaceted contributions, including his philosophical viewpoints and the practical applications of his teachings. The distractors aim to test knowledge beyond the readily available information.


**3. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola navy, under Rajendra I, primarily focused on coastal defense and trade protection, avoiding major overseas expeditions.
2.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions resulted in the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, but not significant incursions into Southeast Asia.
3. Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading port for the Chola Empire, facilitating extensive maritime trade networks throughout the Indian Ocean region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Rajaraja Chola I and his successor Rajendra I led significant naval expeditions that extended the Chola Empire's influence to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and parts of Southeast Asia. Nagapattinam was indeed a vital trading hub, connecting the Cholas to extensive maritime trade networks. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Chola navy was actively involved in overseas conquests and expansion, not just limited to coastal protection. The options are structured to test the candidate's understanding of the Chola Empire's maritime capabilities, its military achievements, and its role in the Indian Ocean trade.  The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, testing knowledge beyond surface-level understanding.



**4. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The award is granted by the President of India upon the recommendation of the Ministry of Home Affairs, based on a rigorous selection process involving a national-level committee.
2.  Recipients receive a monetary grant along with the Sanad (certificate) and medallion, reflecting the significant financial contribution of the awardees to the nation.
3.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded for outstanding contributions across all fields, including arts, science, literature, sports, and public service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Bharat Ratna is indeed awarded for exceptional contributions across various fields. Statement 1 is incorrect because the recommendation for the award comes from the Prime Minister, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, and there isn't a formal, rigorous selection process involving a national committee. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the award does not include a monetary grant. The question tests detailed knowledge about the Bharat Ratna, its award process, and the criteria for selection.  The incorrect options are strategically designed to mislead candidates who may have partial or inaccurate knowledge of the award.


**5. With reference to the Sangam Age, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangam literature primarily focuses on the lives and achievements of kings and rulers, neglecting social and cultural aspects of the period.
2. The concept of Varna (caste system) was completely absent in the Sangam society and literature, reflecting a more egalitarian social structure.
3. Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar are renowned male poets who significantly contributed to Sangam literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct.  Sangam literature covers a wide range of topics beyond kings and rulers, including social life, cultural practices, and the natural world.  The Varna system, while not as rigidly defined as in later periods, was present in Sangam society.  Finally, Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar were prominent *female* poets of the Sangam age. The design of the options aims to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge of the Sangam age, its social structure, and its literary traditions. The incorrect options are carefully chosen to challenge common misconceptions and assess a deeper understanding of the topic.


**6. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The civilization was primarily agrarian, with limited evidence of urban development or sophisticated craftsmanship.
2.  The discovery of the Harappan civilization was solely attributed to Daya Ram Sahni's excavations at Harappa in 1921.
3. The geographical extent of the Harappan civilization encompassed a vast area across present-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Harappan civilization indeed spanned a wide geographical area. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Harappan civilization exhibited significant urban planning, sophisticated craftsmanship, and a complex social structure, indicating a more developed society than solely agrarian. Statement 2 is also incorrect as the discovery involved multiple sites and researchers, not solely Daya Ram Sahni's work at Harappa. The question's design tests the candidate's understanding of the Harappan civilization's scope, urban development, and archaeological discoveries.  The inclusion of incorrect options serves as a crucial test of detailed knowledge, challenging superficial understanding.


**7. With reference to the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme primarily focuses on preserving digital archives and online resources, neglecting physical documents and manuscripts.
2. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are the only Indian works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3.  The MoW Programme aims to preserve documentary heritage, facilitate access to it globally, and raise public awareness about its importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately describes the aims of the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme. The programme encompasses a wide range of documentary heritage, including both physical and digital materials.  Statement 1 is incorrect as the program includes a wide range of materials. Statement 2 is incorrect because while the mentioned works are included, other Indian works are also part of the register.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the MoW Programme's goals and its scope.  The distractors are designed to assess a nuanced comprehension of the programme beyond surface-level information.


**8. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a collaboration between the Ministry of Culture, the National Gallery of Modern Art, and the Archaeological Survey of India.
2.  The project solely focuses on promoting traditional Indian art forms like Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, and Alpana art, excluding contemporary art.
3. The project aims to democratize art by creating public art installations in urban spaces, transforming them into accessible galleries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately reflects the objectives of Project PARI. The project aims to bring art to public spaces. Statement 1 is incorrect because while the Ministry of Culture and the National Gallery of Modern Art are involved, the Archaeological Survey of India is not directly involved. Statement 2 is incorrect because the project includes both traditional and contemporary art forms. The question is designed to test detailed knowledge about Project PARI, its goals, and the organizations involved. The distractors test the depth of understanding beyond simple descriptions.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when the first Buddhist council was convened in Rajgriha, marking the beginning of the standardization of Buddhist doctrines.
2. The observation of IAD is solely limited to India and is not recognized internationally.
3.  The event also celebrates the recent declaration of Pali as a classical language by the Indian government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. IAD does celebrate the declaration of Pali as a classical language. Statement 1 is incorrect because IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the celestial realm, not the first Buddhist council. Statement 2 is incorrect as IAD is observed internationally. The question tests the candidate's specific knowledge about IAD, its significance, and its association with the declaration of Pali as a classical language. The distractors aim to assess the examinee's understanding beyond superficial knowledge.


**10. With reference to Classical Languages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The criteria for declaring a language as "classical" includes the existence of an extensive and ancient literary tradition, going back at least 1500 years.
2.  Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia are the only six languages officially recognized as classical languages in India.
3. The declaration of a language as classical automatically grants it constitutional status and special protection under the Indian Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  While an ancient literary tradition is a factor, the criteria for classical language status are more nuanced and have been revised.  Prakrit and Pali are also considered classical languages by many scholars.  Classical language status doesn't automatically grant constitutional status; the languages are listed in the Eighth Schedule but the classical language status is a separate recognition. The options are designed to test a thorough understanding of the criteria for declaring a language as "classical" in India and the implications of such a declaration.  The incorrect options challenge assumptions and test detailed knowledge of the subject.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Independence Day.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Shri is for exceptional and distinguished service.
3.  Padma Awards are normally conferred posthumously, except in rare cases of exceptional merit determined by the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Padma Awards are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  The institution date is correct (1954). Statement 2 reverses the descriptions of Padma Vibhushan and Padma Shri. The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, a higher order than the Padma Shri, which is for distinguished service. Statement 3 is incorrect. Padma Awards are *not* normally conferred posthumously; exceptions are made in highly deserving cases, but this is not the norm.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Home Affairs based on write-ups submitted by serving central government employees.
2. The primary aim of the Anubhav Awards is to recognize and reward exceptional administrative achievements during an employee's career.
3.  The Anubhav Portal is a platform exclusively for retired central government employees to share their experiences.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. They are based on write-ups from *retiring* central government employees/pensioners, not serving employees. Statement 2 misrepresents the aim. The Anubhav Awards aim to foster good governance and administrative reforms by utilizing the experiences shared by retiring employees, not to recognize past achievements. Statement 3 is correct. The Anubhav Portal is a platform specifically designed for retiring central government employees to share their experiences.


**3. With reference to Gallantry Awards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is awarded for acts of valour in peacetime, while the Ashoka Chakra is for wartime bravery.
2. The Kirti Chakra and Vir Chakra are awarded for acts of conspicuous gallantry in the presence of the enemy.
3. Gallantry Awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, while the Ashoka Chakra is awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or valour or self-sacrifice in peacetime. Statement 2 is correct.  Both Kirti Chakra and Vir Chakra are indeed awarded for conspicuous gallantry during wartime. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gallantry awards are announced twice yearly—on Republic Day and Independence Day. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**4. With reference to the life and work of Nelson Mandela, consider the following statements:**

1. Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 in the Western Cape of South Africa and was the son of a Zulu chief.
2. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and the Bharat Ratna in 2000.
3.  The UN celebrates Nelson Mandela International Day on July 18th each year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While his birth year (1918) is correct, he was born in the Eastern Cape, not the Western Cape, and his father was a Thembu chief, not a Zulu chief. Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the timing of the Bharat Ratna. While he did receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, India conferred the Bharat Ratna on him *subsequently*, in 1990. Statement 3 is correct. The UN does observe Nelson Mandela International Day on July 18th. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.



**5. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion of 1855-56 was primarily led by female leaders, Phulo and Jhano.
2. The rebellion took place in the Chotanagpur plateau and was triggered by the introduction of the Permanent Settlement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Phulo and Jhano were prominent figures, the rebellion was also significantly led by male leaders Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav. Statement 2 is incorrect. The rebellion occurred in the Rajmahal Hills, not the Chotanagpur plateau, and was caused by exploitation and oppression by British colonial authorities and moneylenders, not the Permanent Settlement. Statement 3 is correct. Karl Marx did indeed refer to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution in his *Notes on Indian History*.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**6. With reference to Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. Abhaya Mudra symbolizes compassion and is associated with the Buddha's teachings on suffering.
2.  It is displayed by the fourth Dhyani Buddha, Akshobhya, and represents the overcoming of obstacles.
3.  Other mudras associated with Buddha include Bhumisparsha, Dhyana Mudra, and Dharmachakrapravartana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Abhaya Mudra symbolizes fearlessness, not compassion, although it is associated with the Buddha. Statement 2 is incorrect. Abhaya Mudra is displayed by the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not Akshobhya, and represents fearlessness, not the overcoming of obstacles (although that is a consequence of fearlessness). Statement 3 is correct; Bhumisparsha, Dhyana Mudra, and Dharmachakrapravartana are indeed other mudras associated with the Buddha, each with its distinct meaning.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**7. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to facilitate the return of stolen Indian antiquities from the USA to India.
2.  The agreement is based on Article 11 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The agreement's primary aim is to prevent and curb the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities to the USA and to facilitate their repatriation. Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement is based on Article 9, not Article 11, of the 1970 UNESCO Convention.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the 46th World Heritage Committee meeting in New Delhi, not the 45th meeting in Paris. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**8. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While he was a proponent of Advaita Vedanta, his teachings incorporated elements from other schools of Vedanta as well. He didn't reject other schools. Statement 2 is correct. His address was indeed a pivotal moment in introducing Indian thought to the West. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While he did establish the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, its focus is broader than just religious instruction and spiritual retreats; it engages in extensive social service activities. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**9. With reference to Ratan Tata's accomplishments, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $10 billion to over $100 billion.
2. Tata Motors received the PETA India's "Cow-Friendly Future Award" for using vegan interiors in its Indica model.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The revenue increase under his leadership is generally accurate, but the starting figure is slightly off; it was closer to $5 billion, not $10 billion. Statement 2 is incorrect. The award was for the AVINYA Concept car, not the Indica model. Statement 3 is incorrect.  He received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008, but he did not receive the Bharat Ratna.  Therefore, only a modified version of statement 1 could be considered correct, making (a) the best option.


**10. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India upon the recommendation of a formally constituted selection committee.
2. The award includes a substantial monetary grant in addition to a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion.
3.  The youngest recipient of the Bharat Ratna was Sachin Tendulkar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President confers the award, there is no formally constituted selection committee; the Prime Minister makes the recommendation. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The award does *not* include any monetary grant. Statement 3 is correct. Sachin Tendulkar was indeed the youngest recipient.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**11. With reference to the UNESCO Prix Versailles, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles is awarded annually to recognize outstanding achievements in sustainable architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Prix Versailles does recognize outstanding achievements in architecture, but the focus is on the aesthetics and design, not specifically sustainable architecture. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bengaluru's airport received the award in 2023, not 2022. Statement 3 is correct. The award considers the integration of environmental considerations.  Therefore, only a modified statement 3 is truly accurate, making (b) the closest option.


**12. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1.  The museum commemorates the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
2. The museum is located near the Bhujio Fort in Gujarat, which was built in the 18th century.

(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, not the 2004 tsunami. Statement 2 is correct.  The museum's location near Bhujio Fort and the fort's 18th-century construction are accurate. Statement 3 is correct. The museum does indeed house a large Miyawaki forest. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**13. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was instituted in 1969 to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The institution year and the reason for its establishment are accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect. The award is presented annually, not biennially, and it is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Statement 3 is incorrect. The cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**14. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha was a movement to secure equal rights for Dalits in the princely state of Travancore.
2.  The Satyagraha ended in 1925 with the complete opening of all roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Satyagraha aimed to end the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the temple. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Satyagraha did not lead to the complete opening of all roads; only three out of four were opened. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Gandhi supported the movement, he did not actively participate from the beginning; his involvement increased later. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**15. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action was carried out by the HRA in 1926 to fund revolutionary activities.
2.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Bhagat Singh were key figures in the Kakori Train Action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The year is 1925, not 1926. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan were involved, Bhagat Singh was not directly involved in the Kakori Train Action. Statement 3 is correct. The HRA aimed to overthrow British rule through armed struggle. Therefore, only a modified version of statement 3 is accurate, making (a) the best option.  The other statements contain inaccuracies.


**1. With reference to ancient Indian architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalith, are characterized by their fully subterranean construction.
2.  Megalithic burial structures are exclusively categorized into chamber tombs and unchambered tombs.
3.  The Bavikonda Monastery, dating back to the 3rd century BCE, showcases a Mahayana Buddhist complex.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, not fully subterranean.  The distinction is crucial in understanding their construction and relationship to other megalithic structures.  Fully subterranean structures would represent a different architectural approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials.  Limiting the categorization to only two types ignores a significant category.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bavikonda Monastery is explicitly identified as having a *Theravada* (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, not Mahayana.  The difference between these Buddhist schools is significant in terms of their philosophies and practices, impacting the architectural features of their respective monasteries.  Confusing the two demonstrates a lack of understanding of Buddhist history and architecture.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended only to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2. The Chola navy's defeat at Kandalursalai marked the end of their maritime dominance.
3. Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center during the Chola period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This significantly expands the geographical scope of Chola naval power beyond Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions Rajaraja's destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, it doesn't indicate this as the end of Chola maritime dominance.  The subsequent expeditions under Rajendra I demonstrate the continued strength and reach of the Chola navy.

Statement 3 is correct. Nagapattinam is specifically identified as a key trading center for the Chola Empire, highlighting its importance in their maritime trade network. The statement accurately reflects the historical significance of this port city.


**3. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act mandates the creation of a National Monuments Authority (NMA).
2. The Act empowers the central government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance.
3.  The term "Missing Monuments" is explicitly defined within the AMASR Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMA exists and functions in relation to the preservation of monuments, its establishment is attributed to the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, not the original 1958 Act.  The temporal distinction is crucial.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the AMASR Act empowers the central government to declare whether a monument has ceased to be of national importance, thus enabling its delisting.  This reflects a key provision of the Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly clarifies that the term "Missing Monuments" does *not* appear in the AMASR Act; it's a term used later by the CAG Audit team. This highlights the difference between the legal definition and subsequent interpretations.


**4. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW program was launched in 2002.
2. The Ramcharitmanas, written in the 17th century, is included in the register.
3. The Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is a text of Indian poetics with commentary by Abhinava Gupta.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW program is correctly stated to have been launched in 1992, not 2002. This factual inaccuracy is a key element in evaluating the understanding of the program's history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ramcharitmanas is indeed included in the register, the text states it was written in the 16th century, not the 17th.  This seemingly minor chronological detail is important for demonstrating precise knowledge.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the Sahṛdayāloka-Locana as a text of Indian poetics with a commentary by Abhinava Gupta.  This demonstrates knowledge of both the text and its scholarly context.


**5. With reference to the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and India's role, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi's contribution to the AAM was limited to his time in South Africa.
2. India was the first country to impose economic sanctions on the South African apartheid regime.
3. The UN's role in the AAM involved establishing the Special Committee against Apartheid in 1962.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi's initial contributions were in South Africa, his legacy continued to influence the AAM globally.  The text highlights the lasting impact of his work, extending beyond his time in South Africa.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that India was the first country to sever *trade* relations with the apartheid government in 1946. This is different from imposing full economic sanctions.  The nuance between trade relations and broader economic sanctions is important.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text specifies that the UN established the Special Committee against Apartheid in 1963, not 1962.  The year is a crucial piece of information for demonstrating accurate knowledge of the UN's timeline of actions.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquest extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I resulted in the annexation of only the island's northern region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja I's significant naval victory was against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandyas were a separate kingdom in South India.  While the Cholas did engage with the Pandyas militarily, this particular battle is attributed to the Cheras. This detail demonstrates the importance of precise geographical and historical knowledge in UPSC preparation.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's ambitious naval expeditions did indeed reach the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion highlights the reach and power of the Chola navy during this period.  Understanding the extent of Chola influence is crucial for comprehending the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia in the medieval period.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka led to the entire island becoming a Chola province, not just the northern part. This complete control shows the dominance of the Chola Empire's military and administrative capabilities.  The comprehensive nature of the conquest is a significant detail for UPSC aspirants.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance, the seasonal migration of livestock with human communities, is primarily practiced in the Himalayan regions of India.
2.  In 2023, the transhumance traditions of the Gujars and Bakarwals in the Himalayas were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.
3. The practice of transhumance in India is limited to mountainous regions, with no significant presence in the plains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it's not exclusively limited to those regions.  The statement's phrasing, however, makes it acceptable. The focus on the Himalayas as a *primary* area accurately reflects the scale of the practice there.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023, they were specifically "Transhumance in 10 European States" and "Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland," not those of the Gujars and Bakarwals.  This highlights the need for precise recall of facts and avoids generalizations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Transhumance is also practiced in various plains regions of India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The omission of this crucial information is a significant error.  The distribution of transhumance across diverse geographical landscapes is important for understanding its socio-economic impact.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts were included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Register in 2022.
2. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Beijing, China.
3. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only a single International Register for documentary heritage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the three Indian literary works were indeed included, the year mentioned is wrong.  The year is not specified in the source text but the fact that it is included in the register is true.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This emphasizes the importance of precise location details in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  The statement's simplification of the program's structure is misleading.  The structure of the MOW program is a relevant detail for understanding international cultural preservation efforts.


**4. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra and other Buddhist Mudras, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, a symbol of fearlessness, is primarily associated with the first Dhyani Buddha, Vairocana.
2. The Bhumisparsha Mudra depicts the Buddha calling the earth to witness his enlightenment.
3. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra represents the Buddha's renunciation of worldly possessions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Abhaya Mudra is associated with the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not Vairocana.  The association of specific mudras with particular Buddhas is a detail that requires careful memorization.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhumisparsha Mudra indeed depicts the Buddha calling the earth to witness his overcoming of Mara's temptations during his meditation.  This understanding of the mudra's symbolism is essential.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra represents the Buddha's preaching of the Dharma (his teachings), not his renunciation. The different mudras carry distinct symbolic meanings crucial for understanding Buddhist iconography.  Confusing the meanings of these mudras would be a significant error.


**5. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to facilitate the return of Indian antiquities illegally exported to the USA before 1970.
2. The agreement restricts the import of all Indian artifacts into the United States.
3. Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention forms the basis of international cooperation in combating the illicit trafficking of cultural property.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the agreement aims to prevent and curb illicit trafficking, it doesn't specify a timeframe limiting its application to antiquities exported before 1970. The agreement focuses on current and future trafficking.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement restricts the importation of *certain* archaeological and ethnological material of Indian origin, not all Indian artifacts.  The specificity of the restrictions is important.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention provides a framework for international cooperation in preventing the illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property. This international legal framework is a crucial component of efforts to protect cultural heritage.  Knowing this article is essential.


**6. With reference to the  Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*, which is also used for the production of Mulberry silk.
2.  Oeko-Tex certification guarantees that Eri silk is produced using only organic, pesticide-free methods.
3. Eri silk is known as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori*, which produces Mulberry silk.  The distinction between different silkworm species and their associated silk types is a detail that requires precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Oeko-Tex certification ensures that the textiles are tested for harmful substances and produced in environmentally friendly conditions, it doesn't exclusively guarantee organic, pesticide-free methods.  The scope of the certification needs to be understood clearly.

Statement 3 is correct. Eri silk is indeed known as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, unlike in the production of other silk types where the moth is killed. This unique characteristic of Eri silk production is a key differentiating factor and important for UPSC.


**7. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War was a significant event and Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism is linked to it, the war did not lead to the immediate and complete destruction of Jainism in Kalinga. Jainism continued to exist and flourish in the region.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate causal relationship.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are primarily associated with Jainism due to their construction by King Kharavela for Jain monks, they might contain evidence of other religious practices or influences over time.  The statement makes an absolute claim that is not supported by archaeological evidence.  Cave complexes often undergo changes and additions over centuries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ahom dynasty, while adopting Shaivism and the Shakti movement, did not entirely abandon its indigenous religious practices.  The adoption of new religious beliefs often coexists with the continuation of existing traditions.  The statement presents an inaccurate depiction of religious syncretism and cultural continuity.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chola dynasty's naval expeditions extended far beyond the Indian subcontinent, reaching Southeast Asia and influencing maritime trade across the Indian Ocean. The statement underestimates the reach and impact of Chola naval power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra I's conquest of parts of the Sailendra Empire was significant, it did not result in the complete and permanent annexation of the entire Malay Peninsula under Chola rule.  The statement overstates the extent of Chola control and the permanence of their conquests.  The assertion of complete and permanent annexation is not historically accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Nagapattinam played a crucial role in international maritime trade, serving as a major port connecting the Chola empire with various other regions across the Indian Ocean.  The statement minimizes its importance in international commerce.  Nagapattinam's strategic location and economic significance are well-documented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi is a prime example of Dravidian architecture, not the Nagara style.  The statement confuses the two distinct architectural styles.  The temple's gopurams, vimana, and other features clearly demonstrate Dravidian characteristics.

Statement 2 is correct. The Shree Jagannath Temple's architecture is indeed unique, blending elements of both Dravida and Nagara styles, making it a distinct example.  This combination reflects the evolution of temple architecture and the influence of multiple traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya has undergone numerous additions and modifications throughout its history, reflecting the evolution of Buddhist practices and patronage over centuries. The statement is an oversimplification of a complex historical development. The temple's present structure is a result of multiple phases of construction and renovation.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but the passage doesn't explicitly restrict the award to only Indian citizens.  While it is predominantly awarded to Indian citizens, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as a condition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that recommendations are made by the Prime Minister to the President, not by a dedicated committee. The decision-making process is crucial for understanding the award's functioning.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage specifically mentions that the Bharat Ratna does *not* come with any monetary grant.  This is a significant detail that distinguishes the award from others.

Therefore, only statement 1 (with the clarification) is somewhat correct. Option (a) is the closest answer, though the question could be improved for greater precision. The question aims to test knowledge of India's highest civilian award.

Therefore, only statement 1 can be definitively confirmed as correct. Option (a) is the most accurate answer.  The question tests knowledge about the significance of Nagapattinam during the Chola period, focusing on verifiable facts from the provided text.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the award components (Sanad and medallion, no monetary grant) is accurate.  This tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the award.

Statement 3 is correct.  The passage mentions that the award can be conferred posthumously and that there have been exceptions to the three-award-per-year limit.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the award's historical context and its application.

The question subtly tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between these two possibilities.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Olympic Order was established in 1975, not 1976.  A seemingly minor detail, but crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The award's purpose of recognizing distinguished service to the Olympic Movement is accurately described.

Statement 3 is not verifiable from the provided text.  While Abhinav Bindra's Olympic achievements are mentioned, there's no information on whether he received the Olympic Order Award.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The first year and the four-year cycle of the Commonwealth Games are accurately stated.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Nana Jagannath Shankarseth played a crucial role in shaping the urban landscape of Bombay, contributing significantly to its infrastructure development by planning buildings, streets, and avenues.  His efforts were instrumental in the city's modernization.

Statement 2 is incorrect: While Shankarseth was a strong proponent of education and donated land for schools,  the founding of the Native School of Bombay, which later became Elphinstone College, is not directly attributed to him.  The text mentions his education patronage but does not link him directly to this specific institution's founding.  Other philanthropists were involved in the establishment of this important educational institution.

Statement 3 is correct:  Shankarseth was a member of the committee that provided crucial impetus to the project for the first railway line in India, running between Boribunder and Thane. His involvement highlights his forward-thinking approach and commitment to progress.  This participation demonstrates his understanding of the transformative potential of infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  Swami Dayanand Saraswati's "Satyartha Prakash" is a seminal work that emphasizes a return to the original Vedic principles, rejecting later accretions of ritualistic practices and idolatry.  His emphasis on a return to the Vedas was a key element of his reformist agenda and significantly impacted Hindu thought.

Statement 2 is incorrect: While Swami Dayanand Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj, it was established in Bombay, not Calcutta.  This detail is crucial for accurate historical understanding and highlights the importance of precise geographical location in historical events.  The location of the Arya Samaj's founding is a key fact for UPSC examination.

Statement 3 is correct: Swami Dayanand Saraswati strongly opposed the caste system as it had evolved, advocating for Vedic education to be accessible to all castes and actively campaigning against the practice of untouchability. His social reform agenda was a crucial component of his philosophy and aimed to create a more equitable society. He saw the caste system as a perversion of Vedic ideals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Holkar dynasty was indeed part of the Maratha Confederacy, a significant political entity in 18th-century India.  The mention of other prominent Maratha houses correctly places the Holkars within the broader context of Maratha power. This illustrates an understanding of the political landscape of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect: While Ahilya Bai Holkar was a significant ruler known for her progressive policies and patronage of arts and culture, the text doesn't explicitly state her focus on Marathi literature or the specific commissioning of literary works.  The statement incorrectly attributes specific literary patronage to Ahilya Bai Holkar without sufficient textual support. The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between general knowledge and specific details mentioned in the text.

Statement 3 is correct: The defeat of Malhar Rao Holkar II in the Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, dramatically altering the power dynamics between the Holkar rulers and the British East India Company. This treaty had lasting consequences for the Holkar state and marked a significant turning point in its history.  The treaty's details and consequences are important for understanding British expansion in India.

(b) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group experienced phenomenal growth, significantly expanding its revenue and solidifying its position as one of India's largest employers. His business acumen and strategic vision were instrumental in this success. The scale of the Tata Group's growth under his leadership is a testament to his managerial prowess.

Statement 2 is incorrect: The years of the Padma awards are reversed. Ratan Tata received the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008. The details of these awards are important for demonstrating attention to detail and factual accuracy. This tests the candidate's ability to recall precise information.

Statement 3 is correct: Ratan Tata is indeed credited with the launch of the Tata Nano, a small, affordable car aimed at the Indian market.  This project highlights his commitment to innovation and inclusive growth, making affordable transportation accessible to a larger segment of the population. The launch of the Nano represents a significant milestone in the Indian automotive industry.

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India upon the recommendation of a formally constituted selection committee.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a monetary grant along with a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion.
3.  The award is conferred on individuals for exceptional service in any field.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: While the Prime Minister makes recommendations to the President, there is no formally constituted selection committee for the Bharat Ratna.  The process is more informal than the statement suggests, and this detail is crucial for understanding the award's bestowal.  The less formal nature of the selection process is a key detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is incorrect: The Bharat Ratna does not come with any monetary grant; it is purely an honorific award. The lack of a monetary component is significant, emphasizing the award's symbolic rather than material value.  The absence of a monetary reward sets it apart from other awards.

Statement 3 is correct: The Bharat Ratna is indeed conferred upon individuals for their outstanding contributions and exceptional service in any field, recognizing their achievements and impact on society.  The breadth of fields considered reflects the award's recognition of diverse forms of excellence.  The wide range of fields eligible for the award highlights its inclusivity.


**1. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. He significantly contributed to the urban planning of Bombay, designing its buildings, streets, and avenues.
2.  He established the Native School of Bombay, which later evolved into Elphinstone College.
3. He was a key member of the committee that spearheaded the project for the first railway line in India, connecting Boribunder and Thane.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth played a crucial role in shaping Bombay's urban landscape, contributing significantly to its infrastructure development.  His contributions to the city's planning and architecture are well documented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shankarseth was a significant philanthropist who supported education, the founding of the Native School of Bombay is primarily attributed to  Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy.  Shankarseth's educational patronage was significant in other ways, but not to the extent of founding this specific institution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Shankarseth was involved in philanthropic activities and civic improvement projects, there's no evidence to suggest that he was a key member of the committee that initiated the first railway line in India. This project involved many individuals and organizations, and the statement oversimplifies his contribution.  Attribution of this pivotal role requires strong historical evidence, which is lacking in this case.


**2. With reference to the legacy of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, consider the following statements:**

1. His book "Satyartha Prakash," written in Sanskrit, advocated a return to Vedic principles.
2.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission, a significant organization dedicated to social service.
3. He directly influenced the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Bangalore by inspiring Jamsetji Tata.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While "Satyartha Prakash" did advocate a return to Vedic principles, it was written in Hindi, not Sanskrit.  The language is a crucial detail in understanding the reach and impact of the book.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ramakrishna Mission was founded by Swami Vivekananda, a prominent disciple of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Swami Dayanand Saraswati's work was distinct and focused on a different approach to Vedic principles. Confusing the two reformers is a common error.

Statement 3 is correct.  While not directly founding the IISC, Swami Vivekananda’s meeting with Jamsetji Tata in 1893 significantly influenced Tata's decision to establish the institute.  This demonstrates the indirect but powerful influence of religious and social reformers on India's scientific and technological development.  The temporal proximity and the documented influence support this claim.


**3. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  She became the Queen of Malwa after the death of her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, in 1767.
2. She significantly patronized Marathi literature, including the works of Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi.
3.  She primarily focused on temple reconstruction in the South Indian states, with little involvement in the North.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's ascension to power followed the death of her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, in 1766, not 1767.  This is a minor chronological inaccuracy, but important for accuracy.  The succession was complex, involving the death of her husband earlier, and the subsequent consolidation of her power.

Statement 2 is correct.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was a significant patron of arts and literature, supporting both Marathi and Sanskrit scholars.  Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi were prominent figures whose works she supported.  This patronage is a key aspect of her reign and its impact on cultural development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar is renowned for her temple reconstruction projects, it was not limited to South India.  She significantly contributed to the renovation of temples in both North and Central India, including prominent sites like the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi.  The statement misrepresents the geographical scope of her patronage.


**4.  With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The award's design features a peepal leaf, with "Bharat Ratna" inscribed in English and Hindi.
2.  It was initially established in 1954 and only awarded to Indian citizens.
3.  The award does not include any monetary grant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The inscription "Bharat Ratna" on the medal is in Devanagari script (Hindi), not in English and Hindi.  The language of the inscription is a key detail in understanding the award's symbolism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Bharat Ratna was established in 1954, it has been awarded to non-Indian citizens as well, highlighting India's recognition of global contributions.  Restricting the award to only Indian citizens is a significant misrepresentation of the award's scope.

Statement 3 is correct. The Bharat Ratna award is purely honorary and does not come with any monetary compensation. This is an important aspect of its nature as the highest civilian award.  The focus is on the recognition and honor, not financial reward.


**5. With reference to Ratan Naval Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Under his leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $200 billion.
2. Tata Motors received a PETA India award for its commitment to sustainable and ethical practices in vehicle manufacturing.
3. He launched the Tata Nano, a revolutionary low-cost car, and also played a significant role in establishing the Indian Institute of Science (IISC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ratan Tata oversaw tremendous growth in the Tata Group's revenue, the figure is closer to $100 billion, not $200 billion.  The scale of the growth is still impressive, but the exact figure is crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. Tata Motors did receive recognition from PETA India for its use of vegan interiors in the AVINYA Concept car, showcasing a commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. This reflects a broader trend in corporate social responsibility and aligns with global environmental concerns.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Ratan Tata launched the Tata Nano, he did not play a role in establishing the Indian Institute of Science (IISC).  The IISC was founded much earlier and its establishment is linked to other historical figures.  Attributing this achievement to Ratan Tata is a major historical inaccuracy.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Republic Day.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri recognizes distinguished service of a high order.
3.  Posthumous Padma Awards are routinely given to individuals who have made extraordinary contributions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The order of precedence is reversed; Padma Vibhushan is for exceptional and distinguished service, while Padma Bhushan is for distinguished service of a high order. Padma Shri is for distinguished service. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While exceptional cases may warrant posthumous awards, it is not a routine practice. The government considers such cases on merit.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Finance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The awards are based on write-ups submitted by *retiring* central government employees/pensioners sharing their experiences on the Anubhav Portal, not serving employees. Statement 3 is partially correct. The aim is to foster good governance and administrative reforms based on the experiences shared, which contributes to improved processes, but the phrasing is somewhat broad.  Therefore, only statement 3 reflects the core purpose of the Anubhav Awards with some degree of accuracy.


**3. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra are indeed peacetime gallantry awards. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gallantry awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day.  Only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of Gallantry Awards.


**4. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1964, and were initially called "State Awards." Statement 2 is incorrect. The awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema. Statement 3 is correct. The Directorate of Film Festivals has indeed administered the awards since 1973. Thus, only statement 3 is accurate.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Prime Minister makes recommendations to the President, there isn't a formal selection committee. Statement 2 is partially correct. While it's primarily awarded to Indians, the award is open to non-Indians. Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits the use of "Bharat Ratna" as a title, prefix, or suffix to one's name. Only statement 2 is partially correct, with the caveat about non-Indians receiving the award.

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI relies on the Ministry of Culture's assessment of a monument's national importance before deciding on delisting.  This process involves evaluating factors such as historical significance, architectural merit, and state of preservation.  The decision is not arbitrary but is based on a formal evaluation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does not explicitly define "missing monuments." The term emerged from CAG audit reports and refers to monuments whose locations are currently unknown.  The act does not contain a provision for automatic delisting based solely on a monument's untraceable status.  Delisting requires a formal process and assessment.

Statement 3 is correct. Delisting a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act removes its protected status, allowing for construction and other activities in the area.  This is a significant consequence of delisting, highlighting the need for careful consideration before such a decision is made.  The removal of protection essentially reverses the safeguards provided under the act.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. Although both ministries deal with government employees, they have distinct responsibilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The awards are indeed based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees through write-ups submitted on the Anubhav portal.  This is the core basis for the selection process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the awards aim to improve governance, their primary goal is to foster good governance and administrative reforms based on the experiences of retiring employees, not specifically to promote innovation and technological advancements.  The focus is on lessons learned and best practices, not technological breakthroughs.


**4. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950, alongside the Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra.
2.  The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra were instituted in 1952 as Class II and Class III Ashoka Chakras, respectively, and later renamed.
3. Gallantry Awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1950, but the Ashoka Chakra was instituted later, in 1952.  The question incorrectly states that Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra originated as Class II and Class III Ashoka Chakras in 1952 and were renamed later.  This is a key fact about the evolution of these awards.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year—once on Republic Day and again on Independence Day.  The question incorrectly restricts the announcement to only one day a year.


**5. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha was a movement primarily focused on securing the right to education for lower-caste individuals in Travancore.
2.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker was a key figure in the Vaikom Satyagraha, but he was not imprisoned during the movement.
3.  The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting lower-caste individuals access to temples, was a direct outcome of the Vaikom Satyagraha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right of lower-caste Hindus to access public roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, not education. The movement addressed social discrimination and access to public spaces.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker was indeed a key figure, and he *was* imprisoned during the movement.  The statement incorrectly claims he was not imprisoned.

Statement 3 is correct. While the Vaikom Satyagraha itself didn't immediately achieve full temple entry, it played a significant role in paving the way for the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936. The movement raised awareness and put pressure on the authorities to address caste-based discrimination.


**6. With reference to the Kakori Conspiracy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori train robbery was primarily aimed at funding the activities of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
2.  The Lahore Conspiracy Case directly resulted from the Kakori train robbery, leading to the trial and execution of key figures involved.
3.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Bhagat Singh were among those executed for their involvement in the Kakori Conspiracy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary objective of the Kakori train robbery was to acquire funds to support the revolutionary activities of the HRA.  This was a crucial aspect of the conspiracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both events involved revolutionary activities, the Lahore Conspiracy Case was a separate incident, although some of the same individuals were involved in both incidents. The Kakori train robbery was not the direct cause of the Lahore Conspiracy Case.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bhagat Singh was not directly involved in the Kakori Conspiracy.  Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan were executed for their roles in the Kakori Conspiracy, but Bhagat Singh was involved in other revolutionary activities.


**7. With reference to the Apartheid system in South Africa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Apartheid system was legally instituted in 1948, but its roots can be traced back to earlier discriminatory laws and practices.
2.  The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) was primarily a domestic South African movement with limited international involvement.
3.  Nelson Mandela's philosophy was largely influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's teachings of non-violent resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While 1948 marks the formal legal establishment of the Apartheid system, its origins lie in earlier discriminatory laws and practices that gradually solidified into a system of racial segregation.  The 1948 date represents a formalization of pre-existing discriminatory policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AAM was a significant transnational social movement, gaining widespread international support and playing a crucial role in pressuring the South African government to end Apartheid.  The movement was not limited to South Africa.

Statement 3 is correct. Nelson Mandela was a strong proponent of non-violent resistance inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy.  This influence shaped his approach to the anti-apartheid struggle.  Although he later embraced armed struggle, his initial approach was largely non-violent.


**8. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion was primarily led by a group of Santhal women, with limited male participation.
2.  Karl Marx considered the Santhal Rebellion to be one of the most significant organized mass revolutions in Indian history.
3.  The Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act of 1876 was enacted by the British as a direct response to the Santhal Rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While women played a role, the Santhal Rebellion was primarily led by male Santhal leaders, Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav,  alongside their sisters Phulo and Jhano.  It was not solely a women's movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karl Marx did comment on the Santhal Rebellion, referring to it as India's first organized mass revolution is an overstatement.  His assessment was not a definitive historical judgment.

Statement 3 is correct. The Santhal Parganas Tenancy Act of 1876 was a direct consequence of the rebellion, aimed at addressing some of the grievances that led to the uprising and regulating land ownership in the region.  This act was a direct response to the rebellion's demands.


**9. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

3. The construction of the Puri Canal was a direct result of the lessons learned during the Odisha Famine of 1866.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866 is known as the "Na-Anka Famine" due to its occurrence during the ninth regnal year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva. This is a factual detail about the famine.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw's administration during the famine is widely criticized for its inadequate response, which contributed to the severity of the famine's impact.  He is not praised for his famine relief efforts.

Statement 3 is correct. The construction of the Puri Canal was undertaken as a response to the Odisha Famine, aiming to improve irrigation and prevent future famines.  The canal was built as a direct consequence of the lessons learned.

1. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army and Afghan forces in 1897.
2.  All 21 Sikh soldiers who fought in the Battle of Saragarhi were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest British gallantry award.
3.  The Battle of Saragarhi took place at a strategic communication post in what is now Pakistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought against Afridi and Orakzai tribals, not Afghan forces.  The opponents were local tribesmen, not a national army.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, the highest British gallantry award available to Indian troops at that time, not the Victoria Cross. The question mistakenly uses the Victoria Cross.

Statement 3 is correct. Saragarhi was a vital communication post located in the North West Frontier Province, which is now part of Pakistan.  This detail correctly identifies the location of the battle.



**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Independence Day.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Shri is for exceptional and distinguished service.
3.  Padma Awards are typically not conferred posthumously, but exceptions are made in highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Padma Awards are instituted in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  The awards are conferred later, typically around March or April.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. It reverses the descriptions of Padma Vibhushan and Padma Shri. The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri recognizes distinguished service of a high order.  Statement 3 is correct. While the general rule is that Padma Awards are not given posthumously, the government can make exceptions in extraordinary circumstances where the contribution is deemed exceptionally significant.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. While both are related to the central government, they are distinct entities. Statement 2 is correct; the Anubhav Awards are indeed based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees through the Anubhav Portal. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While recognizing the experience shared is a component, the primary aim is broader—to foster good governance and administrative reforms by learning from the experiences of retiring employees.  The focus is on utilizing the accumulated knowledge for future improvements, not simply recognizing past contributions. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award.
2. Ashoka Chakra Class-I, II, and III were instituted in 1952 and renamed in 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, not peacetime. The highest peacetime gallantry award is the Ashoka Chakra. Statement 2 is correct. Ashoka Chakra Class-I, II, and III were instituted in 1952 and were later renamed Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra respectively in 1967. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year – once on Republic Day and again on Independence Day. Thus, only statement 2 is accurate.

1. The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and were initially called ‘State Awards’.
2. The awards are currently administered by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Film Awards were indeed established in 1954 and were initially known as ‘State Awards’. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The National Film Awards are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The CBFC is responsible for film censorship, a different function altogether. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The National Film Awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate.


**5. With reference to UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles Award is given biennially, recognizing excellence in architecture.
2. The award includes categories for various building types, including airports, hotels, and museums.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award is granted annually, not biennially. Statement 2 is correct; it does indeed include diverse categories encompassing airports, hotels, museums, and other building types. Statement 3 is also correct.  Projects are judged on their innovation, creativity, ecological efficiency, reflection of local heritage, and promotion of social interaction.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**6. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) can delist monuments deemed to lack national importance under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.
2.  The term "Missing Monuments" is officially recognized within the AMASR Act, 1958, to categorize monuments that are untraceable.
3. Once a monument is delisted, it loses its protection under the AMASR Act, 1958, and is open to regular construction and urbanization activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI has the power to delist monuments under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, if they are deemed to lack national importance.  This is based on assessments and reports. Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined in the AMASR Act; it's a term used informally in some contexts, such as CAG audit reports, to refer to untraceable monuments. Statement 3 is correct. Delisting removes the monument from ASI's protection and allows for construction and other activities in the area.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

1. The new Nalanda University campus was inaugurated in Bodh Gaya, Bihar.
2. The ancient Nalanda University was primarily a monastic university focusing on Buddhist studies.
3. The decision to re-establish Nalanda University was taken at the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new Nalanda University campus was inaugurated in Rajgir, Bihar, not Bodh Gaya. Statement 2 is largely correct.  While Nalanda University did offer a wide range of subjects, it was fundamentally a monastic university with a strong emphasis on Buddhist studies. Statement 3 is incorrect. The decision to re-establish Nalanda University was taken at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines in 2007, not the 1st.  Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially correct.  While Nalanda's curriculum was broader than purely Buddhist studies, its monastic character is a key aspect.


**8. With reference to Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded posthumously only in exceptional circumstances.
2. The award comes with a substantial monetary grant.
3.  Recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are formally submitted by a dedicated committee to the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While initially not awarded posthumously, the practice changed in 1966, and it is now routinely awarded posthumously.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does not include any monetary grant. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Prime Minister makes the recommendation to the President, there is no formal committee dedicated to evaluating and recommending recipients for this award.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.

1. The initiative is solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles.
2. Blockchain technology is used for traceability of Kasturi Cotton.
3. The initiative aims to improve the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by improving its quality.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  It's not solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles. Statement 2 is correct. Blockchain technology plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and certification of Kasturi Cotton. Statement 3 is correct.  The initiative aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through better branding, traceability, and certification.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**10. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is executed by the National Museum of Modern Art.
2. The project aims to promote art by creating public installations in urban landscapes.
3. Project PARI includes the promotion of traditional Indian art forms like Thangka and Cheriyal painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum of Modern Art.  Statement 2 is correct. The project aims to democratize art access by creating public art installations in urban areas. Statement 3 is also correct.  The project explicitly mentions the inclusion of traditional art forms like Thangka and Cheriyal painting to showcase India's diverse artistic heritage.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.




**1. With reference to megalithic burial practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic chamber tomb, are characterized by their completely subterranean construction.
2.  Megalithic sites exclusively feature burial structures; no other types of monuments are associated with them.
3. The presence of grave goods within megalithic tombs provides insights into the beliefs and practices surrounding death and the afterlife.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are indeed chamber tombs, but they are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning partially underground, not completely subterranean.  Many are partially exposed above ground level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While megalithic sites are primarily known for their burial structures, they can also include other types of monuments, reflecting a more complex cultural landscape.  The text itself mentions three basic types: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials. This indicates a diversity beyond just funerary purposes.

Statement 3 is correct. The inclusion of grave goods—objects buried alongside the deceased—is a common feature of megalithic burials. These offerings provide invaluable information about the beliefs and practices associated with death and the afterlife in these prehistoric societies.  The presence of pottery, tools, and personal adornments, for example, can reveal aspects of social status, economic activity, and religious beliefs. The analysis of these goods allows archaeologists to reconstruct the social and cultural contexts of these ancient communities.


**2. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization was primarily an agrarian society with limited evidence of urban development or trade networks.
2.  The script of the Indus Valley Civilization has been deciphered, revealing details about their social structure, religion, and political organization.
3.  The standardized weights and measures used by the Indus Valley Civilization indicate a sophisticated level of economic organization and trade relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus Valley Civilization is recognized as one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, characterized by well-planned cities, sophisticated urban infrastructure (including drainage systems), and extensive trade networks extending beyond the Indian subcontinent.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Despite extensive research, the Indus script remains undeciphered.  This lack of decipherment prevents us from fully understanding their social structure, religious beliefs, and political organization. While scholars have made progress, a definitive understanding remains elusive.

Statement 3 is correct. The use of standardized weights and measures is strong evidence of a high degree of economic organization and trade, indicating a complex system of exchange and likely long-distance trade interactions. The uniformity across sites suggests centralized control or a widely accepted system of measurement, essential for commerce and economic interaction.


**3. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola navy primarily focused on coastal defense and did not undertake significant overseas expeditions.
2. Rajaraja Chola I's naval conquests extended only to Sri Lanka, with no evidence of expansion further into Southeast Asia.
3. The Chola navy's success was partly due to its advanced shipbuilding techniques and mastery of maritime navigation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chola Empire possessed a powerful navy that conducted extensive overseas expeditions, significantly impacting maritime trade and political dynamics in the Indian Ocean region.  Their naval power was instrumental in their expansion and control of maritime trade routes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rajaraja Chola I and his successor, Rajendra Chola I, led major naval expeditions that extended far beyond Sri Lanka, reaching Southeast Asia (Malay Peninsula and Sumatra). These campaigns established Chola influence and control over key trading centers in the region.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chola navy's dominance was a product of several factors, including advanced shipbuilding technology, skilled sailors proficient in navigation and maritime warfare, and effective naval strategies.  The construction and operation of their ships demonstrate a high level of technological sophistication.


**4. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure was characterized by a highly centralized system with limited autonomy for regional governors.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign marked a period of decline for the Vijayanagara Empire, with significant territorial losses.
3. The Amara Nayakas, powerful regional governors, were appointed by the Vijayanagara kings and were responsible for both military and administrative functions in their assigned territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure was decentralized. While the emperor held ultimate authority, considerable power and autonomy were delegated to regional governors known as Amara Nayakas. This decentralized system allowed for effective administration of a vast empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Krishnadevaraya's reign (1509-1529) is considered a golden age of the Vijayanagara Empire, a period of significant expansion and prosperity.  His rule saw territorial gains and cultural flourishing.

Statement 3 is correct. Amara Nayakas were powerful regional governors appointed by the Vijayanagara kings, holding significant administrative and military responsibilities in their assigned territories. They collected taxes, maintained armies, and oversaw local governance, contributing to the empire's efficient administration.  They were crucial to the empire's structure and effectiveness.


**5. With reference to the Ahom Kingdom, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Kingdom was characterized by an absolute monarchy with limited influence from a council of ministers.
2. The Ahoms adopted and patronized Buddhism as their primary religion, leading to the construction of numerous Buddhist monasteries and temples.
3. The Ahom Kingdom's downfall was primarily due to internal conflicts and succession disputes, weakening the kingdom's ability to resist external threats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom Kingdom was a monarchy, it had a significant council of ministers ("Patra Mantris") who played a crucial role in the appointment of kings and the overall governance of the kingdom.  The king's power was not absolute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Ahoms interacted with and absorbed aspects of various religious traditions, their primary religious affiliations were with Shaivism and the Shakti movement, leading to the construction of numerous temples dedicated to these faiths.  Buddhism, while present in the region, wasn't the dominant faith of the Ahom rulers.

Statement 3 is correct. While external threats contributed to the Ahom Kingdom's demise, internal conflicts and succession disputes significantly weakened the kingdom, making it more vulnerable to invasion and ultimately leading to its annexation by the British East India Company.  Internal strife played a key role in the kingdom's eventual collapse.


**6. With reference to  prehistoric rock art in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest rock paintings in India are primarily found in the Mesolithic period, depicting scenes of hunting and community life.
2.  Rock art from the Upper Paleolithic period is characterized by highly stylized and abstract representations of animals and humans.
3.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic period rock art often showcases a shift toward more geometric patterns and less naturalistic depictions of animals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mesolithic rock art is abundant and significant, the earliest rock paintings in India are actually associated with the Upper Paleolithic period.  These paintings, though often fragmentary, predate the Mesolithic examples.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Upper Paleolithic rock art in India features naturalistic depictions of animals, with less emphasis on abstract or stylized forms.  The focus is often on accurate representations of the animals.

Statement 3 is correct.  As we move into the Neolithic-Chalcolithic periods, a stylistic shift in rock art is often observed. There's a tendency towards more geometric patterns and a decline in the vivid naturalism seen in earlier periods.  The art becomes more stylized and less focused on realistic portrayals.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty, founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, witnessed the empire's initial expansion and consolidation.
2.  The Tuluva dynasty, known for its efficient administration and military prowess, saw the empire reach its zenith under Krishnadevaraya.
3.  The Aravidu dynasty marked a period of decline, characterized by internal strife and external pressures, ultimately leading to the empire's disintegration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key phases in the history of the Vijayanagara Empire.  The Sangama dynasty laid the foundation, establishing the empire and expanding its territorial control.  The Tuluva dynasty, particularly under Krishnadevaraya's rule, represents the empire's golden age, characterized by significant territorial gains, economic prosperity, and flourishing arts and culture. Krishnadevaraya's reign is marked by military victories and significant administrative reforms. The Aravidu dynasty, the final ruling dynasty, witnessed a gradual weakening of the empire due to internal conflicts, succession disputes, and mounting pressure from external forces like the Deccan Sultanates. This ultimately led to the empire's downfall.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the cultural heritage of India, consider the following statements:**

3.  The Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, a text on Indian poetics composed in Sanskrit by Acharya Anandvardhan, has a renowned commentary written by the philosopher Abhinavagupta.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually accurate descriptions of significant works in Indian literature and literary theory.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar), played crucial roles in mobilizing volunteers and leading the agitation.  The question uses a misleading statement to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The movement initially aimed for access to all four roads leading to the temple, but only partial success was achieved (three out of four roads were opened). This partial success was a point of contention between Gandhi and Periyar.

Statement 3 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha did indeed officially conclude in 1925 after consultations between Gandhi and W.H. Pitt, the then police commissioner of Travancore.  This marks the formal end of the organized protest phase of the movement.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is incorrect. The primary objective of the Kakori Train Action was to rob the train carrying the British Indian Government treasury to fund revolutionary activities, not to assassinate specific officials.  The question uses a misleading statement to create a distractor.

(b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are characterized by shared funding between the Centre and the states.  The funding ratio can vary depending on the specific scheme, but it's never 100% central funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many CSSs deal with subjects on the Union List, they can also be formulated for subjects on the State List to encourage states to prioritize certain areas.  The flexibility in subject matter is a key feature of CSSs.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RISE Accelerator program was launched in 2023, not 2022, and focuses on collaboration between India and Australia, not the United States.  The question uses misleading information to create a distractor.

3. The new campus of Nalanda University, inaugurated recently, is a "Net Zero Green Campus" and aims to be a hub for inter-civilizational dialogue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, not the 10th century CE, and it functioned until the 12th century CE, not the 15th century CE.  The chronology and duration of the university's existence are crucial aspects of its historical significance.  Confusing these dates demonstrates a lack of precision in understanding the historical timeline of ancient Indian educational institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The decision to establish the *modern* Nalanda University was made at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007, held in the Philippines, not the 1st EAS in 2006 in Indonesia.  The summit's role in initiating the university's revival is a significant detail often overlooked.  This highlights the importance of understanding the context of modern initiatives built upon historical foundations.

Statement 3 is correct. The newly inaugurated campus is indeed designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus" and is envisioned as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue. This reflects the modern university's commitment to sustainability and global collaboration, aligning with its historical predecessor's role as a significant center of learning.  The "Net Zero" aspect adds a contemporary dimension to the historical context.


**2. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The library of Nalanda University, known as "Dharma Gunj," housed over five million books across five floors.
2.  The university primarily focused on religious studies, excluding subjects like medicine, astronomy, and politics.
3.  Admission to Nalanda University was based on a rigorous merit-based examination system administered by trained gatekeepers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While "Dharma Gunj" ("Mountain of Truth") was indeed the name of the library, the number of books is exaggerated.  The text mentions "over nine million books across nine floors," which is likely a highly inflated figure. Accurate estimations of the library's size are difficult to ascertain, but the provided number is certainly not supported by historical evidence.  This highlights the challenges in relying on potentially unreliable secondary sources.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The curriculum of Nalanda University encompassed a wide range of disciplines, including religious studies (Vedas, Buddhism), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and even war strategy.  The claim that it excluded these subjects is a significant misrepresentation of its academic breadth and intellectual scope.  This emphasizes the importance of nuanced understanding of ancient Indian educational systems.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly states that admission was strictly based on merit and that examinations were conducted by trained gatekeepers.  This detail illuminates the selective admission process, demonstrating the university's high standards and the importance placed on academic excellence.  This aspect illustrates the sophisticated organizational structure of the ancient institution.


**3. With reference to the National Monuments Authority (NMA), consider the following statements:**

2.  The NMA's primary function is to grant permissions for the construction of new monuments of national importance.
3. The NMA regulates archaeological excavations and protects sculptures, carvings, and other artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NMA was established by the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, not 2011, and it falls under the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Tourism.  The year of establishment and the ministry under which it operates are essential details for understanding its governance structure.  Incorrect information on such details can lead to flawed conclusions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMA's primary role is *not* granting permissions for constructing *new* monuments.  Instead, it manages permissions for construction in prohibited or regulated areas near existing centrally protected monuments.  This subtle but significant difference is crucial to understanding its regulatory function.  The question plays on the potential ambiguity of "construction of monuments."

Statement 3 is correct. The NMA's functions explicitly include protecting and preserving monuments and sites, thereby encompassing the regulation of archaeological excavations and the protection of sculptures, carvings, and other artifacts.  This is a direct function stated in the provided text and reflects the authority's core mandate.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

3. Rajaraja Chola's naval conquests included the annexation of a part of Sri Lanka and a campaign against the Maldives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended far beyond Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  He launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, conquering regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This significantly understates the extent of Chola naval power and its reach in Southeast Asia.  The omission of these significant conquests is a major factual error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai was not a minor engagement.  It was a significant naval victory that demonstrated Chola dominance in the region.  Downplaying its importance misrepresents the strategic consequences of this conflict.  The phrasing "minor engagement with limited strategic impact" is misleading.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Rajaraja Chola's naval activities included the annexation of a part of Sri Lanka and a campaign against the Maldives.  This accurately reflects the scope of his naval conquests.  This statement provides a factual summary of the information.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's medal count in Paris 2024 was lower than in Tokyo 2020 (six medals vs. seven). The text specifically points out this decrease in the medal tally.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's first Olympic medal (a gold) was won in 1900 in Paris.  This predates 1928.  The correct year for India's first Olympic medal is crucial.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that India's performance in Paris 2024 was its *third*-best Olympic performance, not second-best.  The ranking of the performance is a significant detail.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I are known for their aggressive expansionist policies and naval prowess, which significantly impacted the Bay of Bengal trade and relations with Southeast Asia. The "Chola lake" metaphor accurately reflects their dominance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nagapattinam was a crucial trading center, the Chola Empire's naval power extended its influence across the Bay of Bengal, not limited to the Arabian Sea. The question attempts to create confusion by misrepresenting the geographical scope of their maritime influence.

Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra I's successful naval campaigns led to the conquest of territories in Sri Lanka, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra, showcasing the reach of Chola naval might. This is a well-documented aspect of Chola history.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative does involve training women and youth, it's not exclusively limited to them.  The program aims for broader participation to create a welcoming atmosphere for tourists. The question tries to create a false impression of exclusivity.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative's vision clearly focuses on promoting "Incredible India" through the engagement and training of local people. This is a core objective of the program.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The emphasis on developing new tourism products and experiences is not restricted to major metropolitan areas; it aims for a wider geographical reach to benefit diverse communities.  The question introduces a false limitation to the scope of the initiative.

1. The depiction of Lady Justice with scales and a sword originates from Greek mythology, while the blindfold was added during the Renaissance to symbolize justice's impartiality.
2. The Roman Emperor Augustus introduced the worship of Justice in the form of the goddess Justitia, featuring the blindfold as a symbol of fairness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ISA's establishment in 1994 under UNCLOS and its related 1994 agreement is accurately stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ISA does deal with aspects related to territorial waters and sea-lanes, its primary focus is the regulation and management of ocean resources in the international seabed area. The question misrepresents the ISA's primary function.

Statement 3 is correct. The membership and headquarters location of the ISA as stated are accurate.


**6. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

3. The National Monuments Authority (NMA), established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, manages prohibited and regulated areas near centrally protected monuments, but does not grant construction permissions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution outlines the directive principle of state policy regarding the protection of monuments, while the AMASR Act provides the legal mechanism for this.

Statement 2 is correct. The AMASR Act does indeed empower the Central Government to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance, removing them from the protection of the ASI.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMA does grant permissions for construction in prohibited/regulated areas near centrally protected monuments, in addition to managing these areas. The question inaccurately describes the NMA's powers.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra were initially instituted as Class I, II, and III Ashoka Chakras in 1952 and later renamed in 1967.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are awarded for wartime gallantry, while the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are awarded for peacetime gallantry.  The question falsely claims all awards are for peacetime acts of bravery.

3. The first National Handloom Day was celebrated in 2010 to coincide with the centenary of the Swadeshi Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. National Handloom Day is indeed linked to the Swadeshi Movement of 7th August 1905, which advocated for boycotting British goods and promoting indigenous products, including handloom textiles.  The date was chosen to commemorate this significant event in Indian history.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The handloom sector is a crucial part of India's economy and rural employment. It holds the distinction of being the largest cottage industry and a significant contributor to rural employment, with a substantial female workforce.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The first National Handloom Day was celebrated in 2015, not 2010. While the Swadeshi Movement provided the historical context, the actual inception of the commemorative day was five years later.  The question attempts to mislead by using a date close to the correct one.


**2. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*, which is known for its ability to produce high-quality silk.
2.  Eri silk is known as the "world's only vegan silk" because the silkworm is not killed during the cocoon harvesting process.
3.  Eri silk production involves rearing the silkworm *Philosamia cynthia ricini* outdoors, exposing it to natural climatic conditions, and resulting in lower yields compared to other silk varieties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is not produced by *Bombyx mori*.  This is a deliberate attempt to confuse candidates familiar with mulberry silk production.  *Bombyx mori* produces mulberry silk. Eri silk is produced by *Philosamia ricini*.

Statement 2 is correct.  The unique characteristic of Eri silk production is the non-violent harvesting method. The moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, making it ethically distinct from other silk types.  This is why it is called "vegan silk."

Statement 3 is incorrect.  *Philosamia ricini* is reared indoors, not outdoors.  Outdoor rearing is not associated with Eri silk production and would indeed likely reduce yields due to increased vulnerability to predators and disease.  The statement tries to mix facts related to other silk varieties with information on Eri silk.


**3. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

1.  Denisovans were an extinct species of hominid closely related to Neanderthals, but with no genetic evidence of interbreeding with modern humans.

3.  Denisovans shared a common ancestor with both Neanderthals and modern humans, believed to be *Homo erectus*, who primarily inhabited Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Denisovans are closely related to Neanderthals, there *is* significant genetic evidence indicating interbreeding with modern humans, particularly in certain populations of Melanesia and East Asia.  This is a crucial piece of information about Denisovan genetic legacy.

Statement 2 is correct. Fossil and genetic evidence supports a wide geographical distribution of Denisovans across the regions mentioned during the last Ice Age.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The common ancestor of Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans is believed to be *Homo heidelbergensis*, not *Homo erectus*. *Homo erectus* is an earlier hominin species.  The question introduces a very similar but incorrect species name to act as a distractor.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja Chola I's naval power was instrumental in controlling sea routes and maritime trade, not primarily land routes. His naval dominance was key to his conquests and the empire's economic prosperity.

Statement 2 is correct.  Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded the Chola Empire's reach into Southeast Asia, demonstrating the empire's powerful naval capabilities and its influence in the region. His conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra are well-documented.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chola navy was a crucial element in the empire's expansion, enabling conquest and control of vital sea trade routes. It was not a minimal player in the empire’s success.  The statement presents a contrasting perspective to the actual historical reality.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance is a traditional practice, not a modern one. It's a centuries-old system of seasonal livestock migration, deeply embedded in the cultural practices of many pastoral communities.

Statement 2 is correct. UNESCO's recognition of transhumance traditions highlights the cultural significance of this practice and its contribution to the world's cultural heritage.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  In India, transhumance is predominantly found in the Himalayan regions and certain plains, not primarily in coastal areas.  The statement deliberately misrepresents the geographical distribution of transhumance in India.

1.  The MoW program was launched in 2002 to preserve significant documentary heritage across the globe.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many megalithic structures are associated with burials, their use spans beyond the Bronze Age, and into the Neolithic and Iron Ages as well.  The statement restricts the timeframe incorrectly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are semi-subterranean, meaning they are partially underground, not exclusively above ground. The question misrepresents a key architectural feature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Megalithic cultures did not practice a fully nomadic lifestyle. They often exhibited semi-nomadic patterns, combining elements of settled and mobile existence. The statement presents an extreme and inaccurate view of their lifestyle.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Phanigiri is primarily a Buddhist site, not a Jain site. The question introduces a different religious affiliation to create confusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The presence of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, and Viharas clearly points to the site's significant Buddhist association.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bavikonda Monastery is part of the Buddhist Circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, it is located near Visakhapatnam, not Amaravati. The question deliberately changes the location to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. The name 'Bavikonda' literally translates to 'hill of wells,' reflecting the historical significance of water management at the site.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bavikonda Monastery primarily represents Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana Buddhism.  The question introduces a different Buddhist sect to act as a distractor.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Charaideo Moidams are situated in the foothills of the Patkai range, in Eastern Assam, not the Brahmaputra valley in Western Assam.  The location is deliberately misrepresented to confuse the examinee.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Moidams belong to the Tai-Ahom dynasty, not the Koch dynasty. The question substitutes a different dynasty to create a distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The annual rituals associated with the Moidams, including Me-Dam-Me-Phi, are still actively practiced, demonstrating the continuity of cultural traditions.  The statement falsely claims the discontinuation of these traditions.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The university's curriculum was indeed diverse, covering a wide spectrum of knowledge.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the library was significantly damaged during the invasion, some texts survived and were later rediscovered. The statement exaggerates the extent of the destruction and falsely claims that no texts survived.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Harihara I and Bukka Raya I belonged to the Sangama dynasty, not the Tuluva dynasty. The Tuluva dynasty came later.  The question incorrectly assigns the founders to a later dynasty.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is considered the golden age of the Vijayanagara Empire, marked by significant expansion and prosperity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire employed a decentralized system, granting considerable autonomy to regional governors (Amara Nayakas), who were responsible for collecting taxes and managing their territories.  The statement presents a contrasting administrative model.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI Act of 1958 *does* regulate archaeological excavations, as part of its mandate to protect and preserve ancient monuments and sites. The statement incorrectly limits the ASI’s authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Section 4 of the ASI Act empowers the *Central* Government, not state governments, to declare monuments of national importance. The question incorrectly assigns the power to a different level of government.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMA was established under the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Tourism. The question incorrectly attributes the NMA to a different ministry.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the WCCI was founded in New York, not London.  While Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was indeed a founding member, the provided text does not specify that all three founders were women.  Statement 2 is partially correct in that Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was a founding member of the WCCI, but she was the first woman to run for a legislative seat in Madras Presidency, not Bombay Presidency.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that the WCCI's headquarters change with different terms, and Kuwait was the HQ for 2021-2024.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Keeladi excavation began in 2015, not 2016.  The excavation did reveal a dyeing industry and links to the Sangam age. Statement 2 is correct: Keeladi is situated on the banks of the Vaigai River, not the Cauvery, and it does indeed offer crucial evidence linking the Iron Age and Early Historic periods. Statement 3 is also largely correct: Tamil Brahmi script on pottery was discovered, but the text mentions copper needles, not copper smelting. The existence of copper needles implies metalworking skills, but not necessarily a large-scale smelting operation. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are substantially correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sangam did refer to assemblies of poets and scholars, the provided text explicitly mentions notable *female* poets.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the text identifies Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar as *female* poets, not male.  The statement also incorrectly asserts that their works exclusively reflect the Varna system. Statement 3 is correct: The Sangam literature does offer insights into the social structure of ancient Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and reflects the Varna system's presence, though not necessarily its exclusive dominance.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

Statement 2 is correct: Vikramshila University did focus on Mahayana Buddhism and had Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu as alumni. The provided text doesn't explicitly state the year of establishment, but it aligns with the 8th-century timeframe. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Taxila was known for its diverse curriculum, including medicine and astronomy, the text does not mention its destruction in the 12th century.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act empowers the *Central*, not state, government to delist monuments.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act *does* regulate archaeological excavations and protects sculptures and carvings; these are explicit functions mentioned in the provided text. Statement 3 is correct. The NMA, established under the 2010 amendment, does indeed manage prohibited and regulated areas near centrally protected monuments, as stated in the provided text.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja I's significant naval victory was against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. The Pandyas were also a significant power in South India, but this specific naval battle is attributed to the Cheras.  The Cholas had a long history of conflict with the Cheras for control of maritime trade routes and coastal regions.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded the Chola Empire's reach through ambitious naval expeditions. His conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, which controlled parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, marking a high point in Chola naval power and influence in Southeast Asia. This expansion demonstrated the Chola Empire's mastery of naval technology and strategy.

Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra I's naval power played a crucial role in the Chola conquest and annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka.  While previous Chola rulers had exerted influence over parts of the island, Rajendra I's campaigns solidified Chola control, making the entire island a Chola province. This demonstrates the strategic importance the Chola Empire placed on naval dominance.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics-related aspects.  Since the provided text doesn't directly contain explicit economic data, the questions will infer economic implications from the cultural and historical information presented.  The difficulty level aims to be high, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding accurate recall of nuanced details.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the economic impact of the Ahom Dynasty (13th-19th Century AD):**

1. The Ahom Dynasty's strong centralized administration, despite its monarchical structure, fostered a stable economic environment conducive to trade and agricultural development.
2. The Ahom's adoption of Shaivism and the Shakti movement led to significant temple construction, stimulating economic activity through employment and material procurement.
3. The dynasty's downfall due to the Burmese invasion and subsequent British annexation resulted in a prolonged period of economic disruption and decline in Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the economic implications of the Ahom Dynasty's reign.  Statement 1 highlights the positive correlation between stable governance and economic prosperity.  A well-functioning administration facilitates trade, investment, and agricultural production, leading to overall economic growth. The Ahom system, despite its unique power-sharing arrangement, provided a relatively stable environment for such development.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the economic stimulus of temple construction.  Large-scale building projects create employment opportunities, boost demand for building materials, and stimulate related industries, thus contributing to economic activity. The patronage of religious institutions by the Ahom rulers had a clear economic impact.

Statement 3 is also correct.  The Burmese invasion and subsequent British annexation severely disrupted the existing economic order in Assam.  War, political instability, and changes in administrative systems often lead to economic decline, impacting trade, agriculture, and overall societal well-being. The period following the Ahom Dynasty's fall was undoubtedly marked by economic hardship.  Therefore, option (d) is the most appropriate answer.



**2. With reference to the economic activities prevalent during the Chola Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola dynasty's significant naval expeditions, including conquests of Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia, primarily aimed at expanding their territorial control, rather than generating substantial economic gains through trade or resource extraction.
2. The Chola's control over key trading centers like Nagapattinam facilitated the flourishing of maritime trade, generating substantial revenue through taxes and customs duties.
3. The economic prosperity of the Chola period was solely dependent on the success of their naval expeditions and the revenue generated from these ventures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Chola naval expeditions undoubtedly had a military and geopolitical significance, statement 1 is incorrect in suggesting they didn't contribute economically.  Control over maritime routes and conquered territories provided access to resources and trade opportunities, generating significant economic benefits.

Statement 2 is correct. Nagapattinam's importance as a trading hub underscores the Chola's economic prowess.  Controlling such a vital port allowed them to levy taxes and customs duties, significantly boosting their treasury and overall economic strength.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chola economy was diversified and not solely reliant on naval ventures.  Agriculture, internal trade, and temple economies also played crucial roles in their economic prosperity.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.  The question highlights the need for nuanced understanding of historical economic systems, avoiding simplistic conclusions.


**3. With reference to the economic implications of the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

3. The establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission, though partly a result of the Satyagraha's pressure, did not significantly affect the economic opportunities available to lower-caste individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Increased access to temples resulting from the Satyagraha could have led to a rise in pilgrimage, boosting local economies through increased spending on accommodation, food, and related services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Temple Entry Proclamation significantly improved the social and economic status of lower-caste individuals by granting them access to temples and related economic activities.  It removed a major barrier to social and economic mobility.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The Travancore Public Service Commission ensured fairer access to government jobs, creating more economic opportunities for lower-caste individuals, contradicting the statement's claim.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice.  The question tests understanding of indirect economic consequences of social reform movements.


**4. Consider the following statements about the economic impact of the Arya Samaj:**

1. The Arya Samaj's emphasis on education and the establishment of numerous educational institutions and orphanages had a minimal impact on the economic development of the regions where it operated.
2. The Arya Samaj's proselytization efforts, while promoting a particular religious ideology, did not significantly affect the economic activities or social structures of the communities it sought to convert.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

Proselytization efforts, while religious in nature, often had social and economic ramifications, impacting social structures and related economic activities.  The internal split within the Arya Samaj, though primarily ideological, likely had economic consequences through the division of resources and support networks.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct, making (d) the appropriate answer.  The question probes the often-overlooked economic aspects of social and religious movements.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi is a prime example of the Dravida style of temple architecture, characterized by its grand gopurams, Vimana, intricate carvings, and pillared halls, not the Nagara style.  The Nagara style is predominantly found in North India and features a curvilinear shikhara (tower).

Statement 2 is correct. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is indeed located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, along with five other tributaries – Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi, and Malapaharini. This confluence is the reason for its name, Sangameswara (Sangam meaning confluence).

Statement 3 is correct. The Kamakhya Temple's reconstruction in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty incorporated a blend of architectural styles. The Nilachal style, influenced by Upper Burmese (due to Tai migration), Pala (Bengal), and later Ahom styles, is evident in its design.  This fusion reflects the region's complex historical and cultural interactions.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mohiniyattam, the classical solo dance form of Kerala, is conventionally performed by female artists. While it is graceful and expressive, its emphasis is on fluid, swaying movements rather than intricate, rapid footwork, which is more characteristic of other dance forms like Bharatnatyam.

Statement 2 is correct. Kuchipudi, originating in the Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh, is indeed renowned for its Tarangam, a unique and visually striking dance move performed on the edge of a brass plate using the feet.  This highlights the technical skill and precision of Kuchipudi dancers.

Statement 3 is correct. The Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has officially recognized the Indian Kalaripayattu Federation, furthering the promotion and preservation of this ancient martial art form within the national sports framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sohrai painting is a mural art form practiced on mud house walls in the Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, not a form of rock art found in Tamil Nadu caves. It depicts animals, birds, and nature, reflecting an agrarian lifestyle. While it has received a GI tag, its medium and subject matter differ significantly from rock art.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mata ni Pachedi is a religious textile folk art of Gujarat, but it is painted in maroon, black, and white using bamboo-stick pens or kalam, not natural pigments.  It depicts the divine feminine surrounded by devotees, flora, and fauna, and is associated with the Vaghari community.  The description in the statement conflates it with other art forms.

Statement 3 is correct. The Kumittipathi rock art of Tamil Nadu is indeed around 3000 years old, employing inorganic white pigment and natural gum as binding agents. Its depictions of elephants, chariots, and aspects of early human life provide valuable insights into the past.

The statement accurately reflects its religious significance and geographical location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu, and was built by the Chalukya dynasty, not the Chola dynasty. The statement incorrectly attributes the deity and the building dynasty.

Statement 3 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3

Srikakulam, formerly known as Chicacole, was indeed part of the Kalinga dynasty in the 3rd century BCE and subsequently came under the rule of the Gajapati Kingdom during the medieval period. This reflects its historical position within the broader political landscape of South India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are located in Odisha and were built around the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela, they were constructed for Jain monks, not Buddhist monks.  The statement misattributes the religious affiliation of the caves' original inhabitants.

Statement 3 is correct. Salihundam and Danthapuri in Srikakulam are historically significant Buddhist sites.  There is evidence suggesting that Buddhism spread from these locations to Sumatra and other parts of Southeast Asia, showcasing the region's role in the dissemination of Buddhist thought and culture.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Fa.Gu. Halakatti's significant contributions to the revival and promotion of Vachana literature are widely acknowledged.  The statement accurately identifies his area of expertise and impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar did indeed patronize Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram and Marathi poet Moropant. However, while the provided text doesn't explicitly mention Shahir Anantaphandi, other sources indicate her patronage extended to this figure as well.  Therefore, the statement is partially incorrect due to an exclusion.

Statement 3 is correct. Moropant's literary works include those listed in the statement: 'Political commentary on Ramayana and Mahabharata', 'A number of Akhyanes based on puranas', 'Aryabhata', and 'Kekavati'.  The statement accurately reflects his notable contributions to Marathi literature.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Vajrasana in Bodh Gaya is indeed a polished sandstone platform marking the spot where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.  Emperor Ashoka is credited with its original installation, highlighting its historical significance.

Statement 3 is correct. The Tipitaka, comprising the Vinaya Pitaka (monastic discipline), Sutta Pitaka (discourses and sermons), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (Buddhist philosophy), represents the core canonical texts of Buddhism. The statement correctly identifies its three main components and their general contents.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mesolithic rock paintings in India frequently depict human activities like hunting and communal dances.  The artistic style generally showcases a naturalistic portrayal of animals and a more stylized representation of human figures.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of rock carvings along the Zarme river's dry riverbed confirms the presence of prehistoric art in this region.  The depiction of animals, footprints, and cupules is consistent with patterns found in other prehistoric sites.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The earliest rock paintings in India are actually from the Upper Paleolithic period, not the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period.  The Neolithic-Chalcolithic period's art shows a shift in style and color palette, as described in the text, but it is not the earliest.  The statement misrepresents the chronology of Indian rock art.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While glove puppets are used to depict social themes and stories of Radha and Krishna, their geographical distribution is broader than just Rajasthan.  They are found in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, and Kerala as well. The statement is too restrictive in its geographical scope.

Statement 2 is correct. Rod puppets are indeed an extension of glove puppets but are larger and manipulated using rods from below.  Their usage is significant in West Bengal and Odisha, consistent with the information provided.

Statement 3 is correct. Pavakoothu, the traditional glove puppet play of Kerala, is characterized by its translucent puppets and has a diverse repertoire of performances spanning various states including those mentioned in the statement.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian economy:**

1.  India's largest trading partner within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is currently Singapore, and it is also the leading source of foreign direct investment (FDI) into India.
2.  Bihar possesses the most extensive reserves of primary gold ore in India.
3.  The Ministry of Finance is responsible for bestowing the Intellectual Property Awards, primarily evaluating patent applications, grants, and commercialization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trading partner and investor in India,  the largest trading partner within ASEAN might vary depending on the year and data source.  The statement oversimplifies a complex economic relationship. FDI sources are also dynamic.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Bihar has gold deposits, it's not definitively the largest in India.  Gold reserves are spread across different states, and accurate data on primary gold ore resources is often subject to revision and may not be publicly released.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Finance is not directly responsible for Intellectual Property Awards.  These awards are usually managed by a different ministry or department concerned with intellectual property rights, such as the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) or a similar body. The criteria for evaluation are also likely to be broader than just patent applications, grants, and commercialization.


**2. With reference to the Indian financial system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Small Savings Instruments (SSIs) include the Public Provident Fund (PPF), Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, and Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP),  but exclude National Savings Certificates (NSCs).
2.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A, chaired by the Union Finance Minister.
3.  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) are mandated to operate solely within a single village and are not always connected to the core banking system (CBS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  PPF, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, and KVP are indeed SSIs. The exclusion of NSCs in this statement is a deliberate distractor; NSCs are also classified as SSIs. However, the core of the statement about the inclusion of the three mentioned schemes is true.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The GST Council is a constitutional body under Article 279A. However,  while the Union Finance Minister chairs the Council, the statement oversimplifies the Council's composition and functions, which involve representatives from states as well.

Statement 3 is correct. While PACS ideally serve a single village, the practical application may differ. The connection to CBS is also not universal across all PACS;  many are still in the process of digitalization and integration.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding global and Indian gold markets:**

1.  In 2022, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates were the top three gold exporters globally, and India was the world's largest consumer of gold.

3.  The global gold market is characterized by significant price volatility due to factors such as currency fluctuations and geopolitical events, but gold remains a safe haven asset during times of economic uncertainty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While precise rankings can vary slightly depending on the source and reporting methodology, Switzerland, the US, and the UAE are consistently among the top gold exporters. India's position as the world's largest gold consumer is also generally accepted.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Technical textiles utilize both natural and man-made fibers.  The characteristics mentioned are accurate, but the limitation to only man-made fibers is a false assertion.

Statement 3 is correct. Gold's price is indeed influenced by currency movements and geopolitical events, and it's widely considered a safe-haven asset because it tends to hold or increase in value during times of economic uncertainty or market turmoil.  This is a crucial aspect for understanding its role in the global financial system.

3.  The NMA's power extends to declaring monuments of national importance, overriding state-level designations and ensuring uniform standards of protection across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the NMA's role in protecting monuments and its establishment under the AMASR Act. Statement 2 accurately describes a key function of the NMA: managing construction near protected sites. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While the NMA plays a crucial role in the protection and preservation of monuments, the power to declare a monument of national importance rests with the Central Government, as explicitly stated in Section 4 of the AMASR Act, not the NMA itself.  The NMA advises and assists the government in this process, but it doesn't hold the ultimate authority.

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Tuluva dynasty is associated with the *zenith* of the Vijayanagara Empire, not its decline. The Sangama dynasty was the founding dynasty. Statement 2 is incorrect because Krishnadevaraya's reign *did* include both the acquisition of the Raichur doab and the subjugation of Orissa.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas were military commanders granted territories to rule by the Raya (king). They collected taxes, but their authority was far greater than simple tax collectors; they were powerful regional rulers who retained a portion of the revenue.  They didn't directly answer to village headmen; their authority was directly linked to the emperor.  All three statements contain inaccuracies reflecting significant misconceptions about the Vijayanagara Empire's political structure and chronology.


**3. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a practice primarily confined to the European Alps and the Himalayas.
2.  In India, the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes involved in transhumance, primarily rearing cattle.
3. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance in ten European states have been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is practiced in the European Alps and Himalayas, it's not limited to these regions.  It's a traditional practice found in various parts of the world where seasonal variations in pastureland necessitate the movement of livestock and human communities. Statement 2 is partially correct. While the mentioned tribes do practice transhumance and rear sheep and goats, they don't primarily rear cattle. Statement 3 is correct.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance practices in ten European states have been officially recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity. Thus, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.

(c) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MOW program was launched in 1992, not 2002, and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 10th meeting of MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. Statement 3 is correct. The manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

FIDE's headquarters are currently located in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC showcases India's maritime heritage from *ancient times* to the present, not just from the Mughal era. Statement 2 is correct; the NMHC indeed includes a Lighthouse Museum and coastal state pavilions as key projects.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The earliest reference to India's maritime activities is found in the Rigveda, not the Arthashastra. Therefore, only statement 2 is completely accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Kanhoji Angre was the admiral of the *Maratha* navy, not the Mughal navy. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**9. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is largely correct, although the exact number of books is debated.  The library was indeed vast and legendary.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Xuan Zang studied at Nalanda under Chancellor Shilabhadra, not Aryabhata.  Therefore, only statement 2 is largely accurate.  The other statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding the founder and the teacher of Xuan Zang.

1. The ASI was established in 1861 and is responsible for the preservation of only Buddhist sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI was established in 1861, but it's responsible for the preservation of *all* types of ancient monuments and archaeological sites, not just Buddhist sites. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Section 4 of the AMASR Act empowers the *Central*, not state, government to declare monuments of national importance. Statement 3 is correct. The NMA was indeed established by the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.  The other statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding the ASI's mandate and the AMASR Act's provisions.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly impacting the Sailendra Empire.
2. Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center facilitating extensive maritime trade for the Chola Empire.
3. The Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal, referred to as the "Chola Lake," primarily stemmed from their control of coastal fortifications and strategic alliances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra I's naval expeditions reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, leading to the conquest of several regions and impacting the Sailendra Empire's control over these areas.  This demonstrates the Chola Empire's significant naval power and reach.  This expansion was a key aspect of Chola maritime dominance and their influence in Southeast Asia.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nagapattinam was a major port city and a vital trading hub for the Cholas, facilitating their extensive trade network with Southeast Asia and beyond. Its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure contributed significantly to the empire's economic prosperity and maritime power.  Its role as a key trading center is well-documented in historical accounts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Cholas did indeed dominate the Bay of Bengal, their control wasn't solely based on coastal fortifications and alliances. Their superior naval technology, skilled sailors, and aggressive naval strategies played a much more significant role.  The "Chola Lake" metaphor highlights their naval supremacy, but reducing it solely to fortifications and alliances simplifies their complex maritime dominance. The statement overemphasizes a secondary factor while neglecting the primary drivers of their naval power.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tuluva dynasty oversaw the Vijayanagara Empire's territorial expansion to its greatest extent.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign witnessed the acquisition of the Raichur doab, subjugation of Orissa, and significant victories against the Bijapur Sultanate.
3. The 'ayagar' system, a twelve-member administrative body in each village, was appointed for a fixed term and not hereditary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Tuluva dynasty, a significant ruling dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire, is widely recognized for presiding over the empire's most expansive territorial reach and its period of greatest power and influence.  This period saw significant military successes and consolidation of power.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked a high point in the Vijayanagara Empire's military achievements. The conquest of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and the defeats inflicted on the Bijapur Sultanate all expanded the empire's territory and solidified its dominance in the region. His military prowess and strategic acumen are well-documented in historical accounts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 'ayagar' system, while a village-level administrative structure, was hereditary in nature. The office was passed down within families, creating a stable and established system of local governance. The statement incorrectly asserts a fixed, non-hereditary term for these officials.


**3. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Upper Paleolithic period in India is characterized by naturalistic depictions of animals and humans, predominantly in vibrant red and green hues.
2. Mesolithic rock paintings show a shift towards stylistic representations of humans, emphasizing hunting scenes and community dances, while animals are depicted naturalistically.
3. Neolithic-Chalcolithic period paintings exhibit a decline in vividness and a shift to predominantly white and red pigments, with a focus on pottery and metal tools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Upper Paleolithic period did feature early rock paintings in India, the description of predominantly vibrant red and green hues and naturalistic depictions of both animals and humans is not entirely accurate for all sites.  The style and color palette varied across different locations.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Mesolithic rock art in India is indeed characterized by a greater emphasis on human activities like hunting and dancing, often depicted in a more stylistic manner. Animals, however, were frequently still rendered naturalistically. The statement accurately captures the general trend of this period’s art.

Statement 3 is also largely correct. The Neolithic-Chalcolithic period saw a change in style, with a reduction in the vibrancy of colors and a predominance of white and red pigments, often associated with the use of haematite and limestone. Depictions of pottery and metal tools also increased. The statement accurately reflects the stylistic and technological shifts in this era.


**4. With reference to the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) program, aimed at preserving significant documentary heritage, was indeed launched in 1992. The Asia-Pacific Regional Register is a part of this broader global initiative.

Statement 2 is also correct. The manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were among the Indian works selected for inclusion in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, highlighting their cultural and historical importance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the statement correctly identifies the 10th meeting of the MOWCAP as crucial for the inclusion of new works, the location is stated incorrectly.  The meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  This demonstrates a factual inaccuracy regarding the location of the meeting.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:**

1. The Act mandates the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct annual assessments of all centrally protected monuments to determine their continued national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act explicitly defines the term "missing monuments" and outlines procedures for handling such cases.
3. Section 35 of the AMASR Act outlines the process for delisting monuments that have ceased to be of national importance, allowing for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The AMASR Act, 1958, does empower the Central Government to delist monuments that are deemed to no longer be of national importance (Section 35).  This process allows for the resumption of construction and other activities in the area. However, the Act does *not* mandate annual assessments of all centrally protected monuments.  The ASI's actions regarding delisting are based on assessments, but there's no statutory requirement for annual reviews.  Furthermore, the term "missing monuments" is not explicitly defined within the AMASR Act itself; it emerged later from CAG audit reports. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**2. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University was established in the 10th century CE, under the patronage of the Pala Dynasty, and remained a significant center of learning until the 15th century CE.

3. The modern Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is designed as a carbon-neutral facility that promotes inter-civilizational dialogue.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The original Nalanda University flourished from the 5th to the 12th centuries CE, not the 10th to 15th centuries.  The modern Nalanda University's establishment was indeed rooted in discussions at the 2nd East Asia Summit in the Philippines in 2007, not the 1st Summit. The statement about the modern campus's design as a 'Net Zero Green Campus' promoting inter-civilizational dialogue is accurate.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a hybrid cotton variety developed through genetic modification, resulting in enhanced yield and pest resistance.
2.  The initiative utilizes blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of the cotton from farm to final product.
3. The Cotton Corporation of India is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kasturi Cotton is not a genetically modified variety; it focuses on premium quality Indian cotton with existing varieties. The use of blockchain technology for traceability is a core component of the initiative. The implementing agency is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), not solely the Cotton Corporation of India.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Culture and the National School of Drama.
2. The project aims to promote contemporary Indian art forms by creating public art installations across major cities, transforming urban landscapes.
3. Project PARI's first intervention is taking place in Mumbai, showcasing various traditional and contemporary art forms from across India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project PARI is executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National School of Drama.  The project's aim to promote art through public installations in urban spaces is accurate.  The first intervention is in Delhi, not Mumbai.  Consequently, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative:**

1. This initiative is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to promote tourism in rural areas.
2.  The initiative focuses solely on training local women as guides and hospitality staff in selected tourist destinations.
3. The initiative aims to enhance responsible tourism practices across 50 tourist destinations in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The initiative is launched by the Ministry of Tourism, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. While the initiative likely involves training local women, it's not solely focused on that aspect; it's broader than just training women as guides and hospitality staff. The aim to promote responsible tourism across 50 destinations is correct. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was established in 1930, and its recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) came a year later.
2. The IOA's primary function is to select and train athletes for participation in the Olympic Games and other international sporting events.
3. The "One School-One Sport" policy is a significant initiative undertaken by the IOA to promote sports at the grassroots level.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IOA was formed in 1927, not 1930, and received IOC recognition in the same year. While the IOA coordinates with National Sports Federations, its primary function is not athlete training; that's the role of the federations. The "One School-One Sport" policy is an initiative of the Ministry of Defence, not the IOA. Thus, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the various initiatives to promote the sports ecosystem in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The budgetary allocation for sports has remained stagnant since 2014-15.
2.  The Khelo India program primarily focuses on identifying and nurturing elite-level athletes.
3. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) exclusively provides financial assistance to athletes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Budgetary allocation for sports has nearly doubled, not remained stagnant. The Khelo India program targets both grassroots and elite levels. TOPS provides comprehensive assistance beyond just financial aid.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Swami Vivekananda's main contributions were in philosophy and religious reform, not economics. His Chicago address significantly impacted his global recognition, but not primarily in the realm of Indian politics.  His meeting with Jamsetji Tata and subsequent influence on the establishment of IISc is well-documented. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The revenue increase was from $5 billion to over $100 billion, not $10 billion to $200 billion.  Ratan Tata launched the Tata Nano, not the Tata Indica.  Ratan Tata received the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan, not the Padma Shri.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1960, and were initially called 'State Awards'.  While feature films are a major category, the statement about documentary and short films is not entirely accurate as the categories are broader.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely correct.


**12. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The award is given biennially to recognize outstanding achievements in sustainable architecture globally.

The award is given annually, not biennially. The diverse range of categories mentioned is accurate.  While Kempegowda International Airport received the award, it wasn't the first Indian project; the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was shortlisted earlier.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Rajaraja I did engage in naval battles and conquests, the specific battle at Kandalursalai was against the Chera navy, not the Pandya navy.  Rajendra I's extensive conquests included regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading port is well-established.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort to improve the global standing of Indian cotton, but its primary focus isn't just on increasing production.

**Explanation:**

The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is a national responsible tourism program under the Ministry of Tourism, not the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect.  The initiative's scope is not limited to eco-tourism or hill stations; it aims to promote responsible tourism across a broader range of 50 destinations in India.  Statement 1 is incorrect due to the wider geographical scope. Statement 3 correctly identifies the initiative's goal of promoting responsible tourism practices across various locations.

The Mahabodhi Temple Corridor project focuses on improving accessibility and infrastructure, not on constructing a new temple structure. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project indeed involved the restoration of smaller temples surrounding the main temple, highlighting the holistic approach to heritage preservation.  Statement 3 accurately reflects this aspect of the project.  The Pilgrim Corridor Projects demonstrate a focus on not only improving infrastructure but also preserving and enhancing the historical and religious significance of these sites.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; Lothal's significance lies in its well-preserved ancient dry dock, showcasing advanced maritime technology of the Indus Valley Civilization. Statement 3 is incorrect as the NMHC’s scope encompasses a much wider timeframe, not just the Mughal period.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that the difficulty is subjective and depends on the examinee's knowledge base.

**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola rulers Rajaraja I and Rajendra I significantly expanded the empire's naval reach, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake."
2.  Nagapattinam served as a pivotal trading center, facilitating flourishing trade with Southeast Asian countries under the Chola's "Look East Policy."
3.  Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over inland waterways and river systems, rather than extensive maritime conquests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval prowess and its impact on trade.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, through aggressive military policies and a powerful navy, dominated the Bay of Bengal, facilitating extensive maritime trade with Southeast Asia. Nagapattinam was a major port crucial to this trade network, illustrating the Chola's successful "Look East Policy."  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chola navy's strength lay in its maritime dominance, enabling expansion beyond inland waterways.  Their conquests extended to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and parts of the Malay Peninsula, demonstrating a clear focus on maritime power projection.

The IOA acts as a crucial link between national sports federations and the IOC, ensuring India's participation in events like the Olympics. Statement 3 is inaccurate. While private sector investment is important, India's goal of becoming a top-ten sports nation by 2036 involves a multifaceted approach including budgetary support, grassroots programs like Khelo India, and initiatives such as the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS).  It is not solely reliant on private funding.

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately portray the T20 World Cup and the ICC's role. The tournament's inception in 2007 and its status as a significant international event are correctly stated in statement 1.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the ICC's headquarters and its responsibility for organizing major international cricket tournaments. Statement 2 is incorrect; India's 2024 win was their second, not their third consecutive victory.  India previously won the T20 World Cup in 2007.  Therefore only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

**1. Consider the following statements about Megalithic Burials:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic structure, are characterized by being completely subterranean chamber tombs.
2.  Megalithic burial sites exclusively feature chamber tombs; unchambered tombs and non-burial megaliths are not part of this tradition.
3.  The practice of transhumance, the seasonal movement of livestock, is directly linked to the construction and use of megalithic burial sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, not completely subterranean.  The text clearly states they are "semi-subterranean chamber tombs."  Completely subterranean would imply a structure entirely below ground level.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the text explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials. This contradicts the statement's assertion that only chamber tombs are found in megalithic burial sites.

Statement 3 is incorrect because there's no direct link established in the provided text between transhumance and the construction or use of megalithic burial sites. While the text mentions transhumance as a practice involving the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities, it doesn't connect this to megalithic burial sites.  The two concepts are presented independently.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Nalanda University offered a wide range of disciplines, including Vedas, Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy.  It wasn't solely focused on Buddhist studies.

Statement 2 is presented as a fact in the text, describing the vast library collection and its organization.  While the exact number and organization might be subject to scholarly debate, the text presents this as a fact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that admission was "Strictly by merit. Exams were conducted by trained gatekeepers," indicating a merit-based system, not one based on religious affiliation.

3. Section 3 of the Act prohibits the export of antiquities from India, aiming to preserve the nation's cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's primary focus is on preventing the *export* of antiquities, not their import. While the authenticity of imported items might be considered, the main thrust of the legislation is on preventing the loss of Indian artifacts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ASI plays a significant role in coordinating and recovering antiquities, it's not solely responsible for investigations and prosecutions.  Other law enforcement agencies would also be involved in such cases.

Statement 3 accurately reflects the Act's provisions, directly stating that Section 3 prohibits the export of antiquities.


**4. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC is being developed solely by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to showcase India's rich maritime history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that the NMHC is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, not solely by the ASI.  It also incorporates a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Lothal's significance includes maritime activities, the text highlights the discovery of a *dry dock*, not a large shipyard.  A dry dock is a facility for repairing and maintaining ships, not necessarily for constructing them.

Statement 3 correctly reflects the information provided in the text, outlining the development process under the Sagarmala Programme and the use of a PPP model.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the specifics of social organization in the Sangam period are complex and debated, the text mentions the "social classification of Varna was known to Sangam poets," indicating the existence of a hierarchical system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text identifies Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar as *female* poets, not male.  This is a crucial detail distinguishing them from many other prominent figures in Sangam literature.

Statement 3 accurately defines the Sangam as assemblies of poets and scholars, highlighting their importance in shaping Tamil literature and culture.  This is a direct and uncontroversial description from the provided text.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the complex dates back to *prehistoric times*, with evidence from the Iron Age, and mentions artifacts from various dynasties like Satavahana, Hoysala, Vijayanagara, Roman, and Chinese periods—long before the Mughal period.

Statement 2 accurately describes the complex's layout and its diverse chambers, indicating its use for religious practices, habitation, and possibly as an educational center.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions the presence of "painted pottery, coins, and inscriptions," including a notable rock inscription by King Mayurasharma, indicating a rich historical record.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the "use of standardized weights and measures" as evidence of trade and commerce within the Indus Valley Civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text lists "grain, jewelry, and pottery" among the civilization's exports, showing that processed goods were indeed a part of their trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented annually, not biennially, by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Satyajit Ray was a notable recipient, he received the award in 1985, not 1969. The first award was presented in 1969 but to another recipient. Statement 3 is correct. The award comprises a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize (currently ₹10 lakhs).  The correct option is (b) because only statement 3 accurately reflects the facts about the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.  The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding the frequency of the award presentation, the year of Satyajit Ray's award, and the awarding ministry.  Understanding the details of this prestigious award is crucial for aspirants, as it often features in current affairs related to Indian cinema.

It encompasses various categories, including airports, campuses, museums, and hotels. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was shortlisted for the award, but it is not explicitly stated that it was a recipient.  Statement 3 is correct. The award's evaluation criteria explicitly include innovation, local heritage reflection, ecological efficiency, and the promotion of social interaction. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or ambiguities regarding the scope of the award and the status of the Smritivan Museum as a recipient.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, not the 7th century CE by Harshavardhana.  It ceased to function in the 12th century CE, not the 15th century CE. Statement 2 is correct. The university's curriculum was indeed diverse, encompassing Vedic studies, various Buddhist sects, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, and other disciplines. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the library, "Dharma Gunj," was extensive, the number of books is exaggerated; it held over nine million books, not ten million.

They are the royal necropolis of the Tai-Ahom dynasty, not the Chutia dynasty. Statement 3 is correct. The annual rituals, Me-Dam-Me-Phi (ancestor worship) and Tarpan (libation ceremony), are still practiced, demonstrating cultural continuity. Thus, only statement 3 is accurate.  The other statements contain geographical and dynastic inaccuracies. The question tests knowledge of Northeast Indian history and cultural practices, an increasingly important area in the UPSC examination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st as International Yoga Day in 2014, based on a proposal from India, not China. Statement 2 is correct. Yoga is indeed one of the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy, alongside Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Purva Mimamsa, and Vedanta. Statement 3 is correct. While evidence of yoga practices exists from earlier periods, the most systematic and comprehensive treatment is found in Patanjali's Yogasutra, dating back to the 2nd century BCE.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The incorrect statement highlights a common misconception about the origin of the International Yoga Day proposal.  The question tests knowledge of both yoga's philosophical background and its global recognition.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Rajendra I did conquer Sri Lanka, making it a Chola province,  Rajaraja I also significantly expanded Chola naval power and influence through his naval expeditions. His destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai is a prime example of this.  The statement oversimplifies Rajaraja I's achievements.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. Nagapattinam was indeed a vital trading hub for the Cholas, serving as a critical link in their extensive maritime trade network with Southeast Asia.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Chola navy's control of the Bay of Bengal is well-documented, allowing them to dominate trade and exert their influence across the region. The term "Chola Lake" accurately reflects this dominance.  Therefore, option (b) is the most accurate representation of the facts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included, the total number of works included was more than 17, not just 17 Indian works.  The total number of works included from the entire Asia-Pacific region exceeded 17.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. The MoW Programme's structure and purpose as described are accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While June 21st is IYD and the resolution was passed in 2014, it coincides with the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, not the Winter Solstice.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative originated from India and secured widespread international support.

Statement 3 is correct. The etymology and philosophical context of Yoga are accurately described. The six schools of Indian philosophy are correctly listed.

(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. It accurately describes the practice of transhumance in the Himalayas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that this system also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023, they were from Europe and Switzerland, not specifically the Himalayas.  UNESCO's recognition of Himalayan transhumance is not mentioned in the given text.


**5. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its archaeological sites, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, where Emperor Ashoka annexed Kalinga, led to the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves as a testament to his Buddhist faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were not built by Ashoka.  They were constructed much later. The Kalinga War did lead to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, but this didn't directly result in the construction of these particular caves.

Statement 2 is correct.  Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and his association with the caves are well-established facts.  The Hathigumpha inscription provides valuable information about his reign.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the caves are indeed the earliest examples of rock-cut cave traditions in Odisha, they were built during the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela, not during the Gupta period. The mention of Vaishnavite caves in Udayagiri near Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, refers to a different location.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval power and achieved many victories, the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai is not definitively supported by historical records.  The Chera navy was indeed defeated at a place called Kandalursalai, but not the Pandya navy.  His conquests focused more on the Cheras and Sri Lanka.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's ambitious naval expeditions reached the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion significantly increased Chola influence in Southeast Asia.

Statement 3 is correct. While the extent of Chola control over Sri Lanka varied throughout their rule, Rajendra I's conquests did lead to a period where the entire island was under Chola administration.  However, it's important to note that this control wasn't permanent.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its landscapes in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a traditional practice primarily associated with pastoral communities in the Himalayan region, involving the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities between high-altitude pastures and lower plains.
2. In India, transhumance is exclusively practiced in the Himalayan region by nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas.
3. The UNESCO has inscribed several transhumance traditions in India as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Transhumance, as a seasonal migration pattern with livestock, is a defining feature of pastoralism, especially prominent in the Himalayas but also found across diverse landscapes in India.  The movement caters to seasonal availability of pastureland.

Statement 2 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Bavikonda Monastery is near Visakhapatnam and does date back to the 3rd century BCE, it is associated with Theravada (Hinayana), not Mahayana Buddhism.  The statement incorrectly assigns it to the wrong branch of Buddhism and misrepresents its chronology.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's administration utilized the Amara-Nayaka system, which granted considerable autonomy to regional rulers (Amara-Nayakas).  These rulers controlled territories, collected taxes, and retained a portion of the revenue.  The statement misrepresents the decentralized nature of the empire's administration.

(d) 2 and 3 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ratna Bhandar contains jewels associated with the holy trinity of Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra, not solely Lord Jagannath.  The statement's limitation to a single deity is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kedarnath Temple's status as a Jyotirlinga dedicated to Lord Shiva and its inclusion in the Char Dham circuit are accurate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Chandravalli cave complex is ancient and contains chambers used for religious purposes, it also includes rooms for visitors and sadhus, a drawing room, a bedroom, and even a water outlet and tank.  The statement incorrectly restricts its function to only religious activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, Section 3, clearly prohibits the *export* of antiquities.  It doesn't address import regulations directly; those would fall under separate customs and import laws.  The statement creates a false equivalence between export restrictions and lack of import controls.

Statement 2 is incorrect as the ASI's role in international coordination and recovery is a part of a larger network involving international collaborations and law enforcement agencies in various countries.  The ASI plays a crucial role, but it is not solely responsible.  The statement oversimplifies the complex international legal framework involved in repatriation of stolen artifacts.

Statement 3 is correct. The Kashi Culture Pathway is a significant initiative emerging from the G20 Culture Working Group, explicitly designed to build a global framework for tackling illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts. While it's not limited to South Asia, the initiative is directly relevant to the issue raised in the question.

3. In 2023, transhumance traditions in ten European states and Switzerland were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, the practice also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement omits crucial information about the geographical distribution of transhumance in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, not Nepal. This demonstrates a lack of awareness of the key players involved in promoting and preserving this practice.

Statement 3 is correct. UNESCO did indeed recognize transhumance traditions in ten European states and Switzerland as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023. This showcases accurate recall of a specific event and demonstrates an understanding of UNESCO's role in cultural preservation.

3.  The MoW Programme aims to preserve global documentary heritage, ensure universal access to it, and enhance public awareness of its significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. The statement incorrectly limits the number of registers, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the program's structure and reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ramcharitmanas, written in the 16th century by Goswami Tulsidas in Awadhi, not Sanskrit, was included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  The statement contains a factual error regarding both the language and the century of its composition.

Statement 3 is correct. The MoW Programme's objectives accurately reflect its stated goals: preservation, access, and awareness of global documentary heritage. This showcases accurate knowledge of the program's core mission and purpose.


**4. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 6th century CE by Chandragupta I, was a center of learning until the 13th century CE.

3. The decision to establish the new Nalanda University originated from the 3rd East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2007.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, not Chandragupta I in the 6th century, and it functioned until the 12th century CE, not the 13th century. The statement contains errors in both the founder and the duration of the university’s existence.

Statement 2 is correct. The recently inaugurated Nalanda University campus is indeed designed as a 'Net Zero Green Campus' and is situated near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Rajgir, Bihar.  This statement accurately reflects the facts surrounding the new university's establishment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The decision to establish the new Nalanda University was made at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007, not the 3rd EAS.  This subtle error highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.


**5. With reference to the  Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. Instituted in 1969, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India’s highest award in the field of cinema, presented biennially by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
2. The award commemorates the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema, and the recipient receives a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ₹20 lakhs.
3.  Satyajit Ray received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1984, while Amitabh Bachchan received the award in 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented *annually*, not biennially. It also incorrectly states that the Directorate of Film Festivals is the presenter, although they administer it.  The statement contains multiple inaccuracies regarding the frequency of presentation and the administering body.

Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts. While the award does commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary and the recipient receives the items mentioned, the cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  The statement contains an inaccurate amount for the cash prize.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Satyajit Ray received the award in 1985, not 1984, and Amitabh Bachchan received it in 2018, not 2019. This statement involves errors in the years in which these prominent personalities were awarded.  The inaccuracies demonstrate the importance of precise chronological knowledge.


**1. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna award was instituted by the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, on January 26, 1950.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna are prohibited from using the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their names, as per Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution.
3.  Sachin Tendulkar was the first sportsperson to be awarded the Bharat Ratna, and also the youngest recipient.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna was established on January 2, 1954, not January 26, 1950, by then-President Dr. Rajendra Prasad.  The date is crucial and often a point of confusion.  Statement 2 is correct. Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution explicitly prohibits the use of titles, including "Bharat Ratna," as prefixes or suffixes to names.  This is a key constitutional provision related to the award. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While Sachin Tendulkar was indeed the first sportsperson to receive the Bharat Ratna, he was not the youngest recipient.  This statement combines a true fact with a false one, creating a misleading distractor.


**2. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are awarded annually on Republic Day.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri is awarded for distinguished service of a high order.
3.  Padma Awards are typically not conferred posthumously, but exceptions are made in highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While the Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day, the actual conferment ceremony can take place later. This minor detail makes it a partially correct but misleading statement. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Padma Vibhushan is for exceptional and distinguished service, but the Padma Bhushan is for distinguished service of a high order; the Padma Shri is for distinguished service. The order of prestige and the descriptions are reversed in the statement, a common error for candidates to make. Statement 3 is correct.  The general rule is that Padma Awards are not given posthumously, but exceptions are made, highlighting the flexibility and discretion involved in the award process. This fact is less commonly known and thus acts as a good test of knowledge.


**3. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
2. The awards are based on Anubhav write-ups submitted by retiring state government employees.
3. The aim of the Anubhav Awards is to promote good governance and administrative reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. This is a subtle but important distinction between related government departments. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the awards are based on Anubhav write-ups, these are submitted by retiring *central* government employees/pensioners, not state government employees.  This distinction is vital in understanding the scope of the award. Statement 3 is correct.  The primary aim of the Anubhav Awards is to use the experience of retiring employees to foster good governance and administrative reforms, making it a valuable initiative for policy improvements.


**4. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, not peacetime.  The Ashoka Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award. This is a crucial distinction between the two categories of awards. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra were initially instituted in 1952 as different classes of the Ashoka Chakra, they were renamed in 1967. The original institution date and the renaming are both important details to remember. Statement 3 is correct. Gallantry awards are indeed announced twice a year, coinciding with Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations. This is a well-known fact, but included to provide a correct answer among the distractors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Film Awards were indeed established in 1954 and initially known as the 'State Awards'. This historical context is important in understanding the evolution of the award. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973, not since their inception in 1954.  This is a significant detail regarding the administrative history of the awards. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the awards are given in the categories of Feature Films and Non-Feature Films, the third category is Best Writing *in* Cinema, not *on* Cinema. The subtle difference in phrasing is a common distractor technique.


**6. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award is granted annually, not biennially, by UNESCO. The frequency of the award is a key detail often overlooked. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was *shortlisted* for the award, but did not win in 2023. The distinction between shortlisting and winning is important. Statement 3 is correct.  Projects are indeed judged on their ecological efficiency and their promotion of social interaction, reflecting the award's broader sustainability and community engagement goals. This is a key aspect of the award criteria.


**7.  With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was formed in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first president and recognized by the IOC in 1928.
2. The Khelo India program is primarily aimed at identifying and developing athletes at the elite level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The IOA was formed in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its president, and it was recognized by the IOC in the *same year*, not 1928. The year of IOC recognition is a crucial detail. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Khelo India program aims to identify and develop athletes at both the grassroots and elite levels, not solely at the elite level.  The program's broad reach is a key feature. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The TOPS scheme does provide comprehensive assistance, including top-tier coaching, in addition to funding and specialized equipment.  The omission of coaching is a misleading detail.

1. Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton from India with 100% traceability and certification, utilizing blockchain technology for traceability.
2. The initiative is solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles and does not involve any other stakeholders.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Kasturi Cotton is indeed a premium quality cotton with 100% traceability and certification, utilizing blockchain technology. This highlights the technological aspect of the initiative. Statement 2 is incorrect. The initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, Trade Bodies, and the industry, not solely the Ministry of Textiles. The collaborative nature of the initiative is crucial. Statement 3 is correct.  TEXPROCIL is indeed the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  This detail specifies the agency responsible for carrying out the initiative.


**9. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a collaboration between the Ministry of Culture, Lalit Kala Akademi, and the National Gallery of Modern Art.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project PARI is indeed a collaboration between the Ministry of Culture, Lalit Kala Akademi, and the National Gallery of Modern Art. This collaborative nature is a key aspect of the project. Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary aim is to *democratize* art through public installations, making it accessible to a wider audience, not to commercialize art.  The focus on accessibility is crucial. Statement 3 is correct.  Project PARI does include traditional art forms like Thangka painting and Cheriyal painting, showcasing India's diverse artistic heritage.  The inclusion of traditional art forms is a key element.


**10. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The initiative aims to enhance tourist experiences by connecting tourists with local people who serve as ambassadors and storytellers for their destinations. This is a core objective of the initiative. Statement 2 is incorrect. The initiative places *special emphasis* on training women and youth, not solely men.  The focus on women and youth is a key feature of the initiative's approach. Statement 3 is incorrect. The initiative is implemented across 50 tourist destinations, not all tourist destinations in India. The limited scope of implementation is an important detail.


**1. With reference to the economic policies and contributions of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic policies primarily focused on agricultural development and land reforms, leading to significant increases in agricultural output during her reign.

3.  Her economic reforms included the introduction of a new currency system and the establishment of a centralized banking system to streamline financial transactions within her kingdom.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw Maheswar and Indore become prominent centers of trade and commerce.  Her patronage of the Maheswari weaving industry is well-documented, and the recognition of "Maheswar Sarees & Fabric" as a GI product attests to its enduring legacy.  This showcases her understanding of the importance of local industries and their contribution to the economy.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar's reign brought prosperity, her economic policies weren't primarily focused on agricultural development and land reforms in the way the statement suggests. Her focus was more on infrastructure development, trade, and patronage of artisans. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of her economic approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. There's no historical evidence to support the claim that Devi Ahilyabai Holkar introduced a new currency system or a centralized banking system. Her economic policies were primarily focused on fostering trade and commerce, and promoting existing industries rather than implementing large-scale financial reforms.


**2. With reference to the life and work of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati's original name was Mula Shankar, and he was born in 1824 in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.
2.  His most significant literary contribution, "Satyartha Prakash," advocated a return to Vedic principles and emphasized the importance of Vedic education for all castes, including the rejection of the caste system as hereditary.
3.  He established the Arya Samaj in 1875 in Calcutta, with its primary objective being the promotion of interfaith dialogue and religious harmony.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects Swami Dayanand Saraswati's work.  "Satyartha Prakash" is his seminal work, advocating a return to Vedic principles, rejecting idolatry, and strongly opposing the hereditary nature of the caste system.  His emphasis on Vedic education for all castes was a crucial part of his social reform agenda.

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While his original name was indeed Mula Shankar, he was not born in Varanasi but in Morvi, Kathiawar (Gujarat).  This geographical detail is important for understanding his context and early life.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Arya Samaj, established in 1875, was not founded in Calcutta but in Bombay.  Furthermore, its primary objective wasn't interfaith dialogue but rather a return to what Dayanand saw as the pure principles of the Vedas, advocating for monotheism and social reform within the Hindu tradition.  The statement misrepresents the organization's core tenets and its location of founding.


**3.  Consider the following statements about the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty was a prominent member of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside the Bhonsle of Nagpur, the Gaekwad of Baroda, and the Scindia of Gwalior.  Malhar Rao Holkar was the founder of the dynasty and played a key role in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.
2.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, after becoming the ruler of Malwa in 1767, significantly patronized the arts and culture, commissioning the construction of numerous temples and supporting various artists and scholars, including Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi.
3.  The Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the defeat of the Holkar Dynasty under Malhar Rao II, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, which significantly reduced the Holkars' independence and power.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Holkar Dynasty was indeed a part of the Maratha Confederacy, along with the other mentioned dynasties,  Malhar Rao Holkar played a key role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, not the Second. This chronological error makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage of art and culture is well-documented. Her contributions to temple construction and her support for artists like Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi significantly enriched the cultural landscape of the region.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Third Anglo-Maratha War did result in the defeat of the Holkar Dynasty under Malhar Rao II, culminating in the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, which significantly curtailed their autonomy and power under British control.  This treaty marked a turning point in the Holkar Dynasty's history.


**4. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was indeed born in 1803 in a Brahmin family, his birthplace was Murbad in Thane district, not Pune.  More importantly, he wasn't involved in the Indian independence movement. His contributions were primarily in urban development, philanthropy, and education.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  His philanthropic endeavors were significant, focusing particularly on education, including donating land for schools and contributing to the establishment of Elphinstone College. However, his direct contribution to the development of Indian Railways is not prominently featured in historical accounts, although he was a committee member related to early railway projects.

Statement 3 is correct.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth holds the distinction of being the first Indian nominated to the Legislative Council of Bombay and a member of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, showcasing his prominent role in the political and intellectual spheres of Bombay.


**5. With reference to Ratan Naval Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  During Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from approximately $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of the largest employers in India.  He is also known for launching the Tata Indica, a revolutionary car that significantly impacted the Indian automobile market.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The revenue growth of the Tata Group under Ratan Tata's leadership is accurate. However, he launched the Tata Nano, not the Tata Indica.  The Tata Indica was launched much earlier. This factual inaccuracy affects the overall accuracy of the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. Tata Motors' receipt of the PETA India award for the AVINYA Concept car's vegan interiors is a well-documented event showcasing their commitment to sustainability and animal welfare.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While Ratan Tata did receive the Padma Vibhushan (2008), he did not receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award.  The inclusion of an incorrect award significantly impacts the statement's accuracy.  The statement incorrectly attributes an award to him.


**1. With reference to the contributions of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, born in 1725, significantly contributed to the reconstruction of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Somnath Temple in Gujarat.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar is indeed known for her significant contributions to the reconstruction of both the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Somnath Temple.  These acts of patronage highlight her commitment to religious preservation and her impact on religious architecture.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was a patron of the arts and learning.  Her support for scholars like Khushali Ram and Moropant, who wrote significant works, showcases her commitment to cultural preservation and intellectual growth. Moropant's works, including political commentaries on the epics and other literary pieces, demonstrate the intellectual environment she fostered.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Her economic policies, particularly her focus on Maheshwar and Indore, actually led to their rise as prominent centers of trade and commerce. The Maheswari weaving industry flourished under her patronage, becoming a significant contributor to the region's economy. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of decline.


**2. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contribution to the urban development of Bombay is well-documented. His involvement in shaping the city's infrastructure is a testament to his urban planning vision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While he did contribute to education, particularly by donating land for schools with an emphasis on girls' education, he is not known for establishing universities.  The statement exaggerates the scale and nature of his educational contributions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While he was inspired by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, a prominent philanthropist, there's no significant evidence to suggest he was directly inspired by Dadabhai Naoroji or actively participated in the early independence movement.  The statement incorrectly links him to a specific political figure and movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda was a significant figure in the dissemination of Vedanta philosophy, his primary contributions weren't directly focused on the development of Yoga and Ayurveda, although he certainly promoted a holistic approach to life.

Statement 2 is correct.  His address at the World's Parliament of Religions was a landmark event that introduced Vedanta philosophy to a global audience, significantly shaping Western perceptions of Indian spirituality.

Statement 3 is partially correct regarding the establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, not 1896, but the statement misrepresents its primary focus. The Ramakrishna Mission, while involved in social service and reform, had broader aims than solely addressing untouchability and women's education.  Its work encompassed spiritual and educational dimensions as well.

1. The Vijayanagara Empire, established in 1336, was primarily known for its strong centralized administration which minimized the power of regional governors.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's administration, while powerful, relied significantly on the decentralization of power through the Amara-Nayaka system, granting considerable autonomy to regional governors. This system, while effective in managing a vast empire, differed from a strictly centralized model.

Statement 2 is correct.  Krishnadevaraya's reign is widely considered the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire's power and territorial expansion. His military successes and administrative reforms contributed greatly to the empire's vast reach.

Statement 3 is largely correct.  The architectural marvels of Hampi are indeed renowned, but the description of their style needs clarification. While Dravidian elements are prominent, characterizing the style as a "blend of Dravidian and Islamic" is an oversimplification.  There's a strong predominance of Dravidian architectural elements, though other influences might have been present. The statement is not entirely false, but could be improved for accuracy.


**5. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government initiative aimed at promoting the use of genetically modified cotton varieties in India to increase yield and improve fiber quality.
2. The initiative utilizes blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of Indian cotton, enhancing its global competitiveness.
3.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative does not promote genetically modified cotton. It focuses on premium quality, naturally grown Indian cotton. The statement misrepresents the core objective of the initiative.

Statement 2 is correct.  Blockchain technology is a key component of the initiative, providing a transparent and verifiable system for tracking the cotton's journey from farm to market. This enhances traceability and strengthens consumer confidence in the product's origin and quality.

Statement 3 is correct.  TEXPROCIL is the designated implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, responsible for overseeing its implementation and achieving its goals.


**1. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, signed in 2019, granted visa-free access to Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan for a period of 10 years.
2.  Pakistani Sikhs can visit Dera Baba Nanak in India without an Indian visa using the Kartarpur Corridor.
3. The agreement stipulates that pilgrims using the corridor must return to their country of origin on the same day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, signed in 2019, was initially valid for 5 years, not 10.  While there have been discussions and agreements to extend its validity, the initial duration was 5 years.  The question plays on the common knowledge of the corridor's existence, attempting to mislead with an incorrect timeframe.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kartarpur Corridor primarily facilitates the movement of Indian pilgrims to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan.  Reciprocal visa-free access for Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India is not a feature of the agreement. This statement introduces a false sense of symmetry to the agreement.

Statement 3 is correct. The agreement explicitly required pilgrims to return on the same day. This detail is often overlooked in broader discussions of the corridor's purpose and significance, making it a suitable testing point for factual recall.  The other statements are designed to distract from this less-prominent but crucial detail.


**2. With reference to important Sikh pilgrimage sites, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gurdwara Ber Sahib is located in Amritsar, Punjab.
2. Takht Sri Patna Sahib is situated in Haryana.
3. Akal Takht is located within the complex of Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gurdwara Ber Sahib is actually located in Sultanpur Lodhi, Punjab, not Amritsar. This statement uses a well-known city (Amritsar) associated with Sikhism to create a plausible but incorrect association.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Takht Sri Patna Sahib is located in Patna, Bihar, not Haryana.  This statement subtly alters the state, relying on the examinee's possible lack of precise geographical knowledge of Sikh pilgrimage sites.

Statement 3 is correct. Akal Takht is indeed one of the five Takhts (seats of temporal authority) within the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar.  This statement is a straightforward fact, but the incorrect statements surrounding it make the question challenging.  The question tests specific knowledge of the locations of significant Sikh sites.


**3. With reference to the teachings of Guru Nanak, consider the following statements:**

1. Guru Nanak's emphasis was primarily on the renunciation of worldly possessions as the path to liberation.
2. The concept of "seva" (selfless service) is a secondary aspect of Sikhism, less emphasized than individual spiritual practices.
3.  Guru Nanak initiated the community meal, "guru ka langar," at Kartarpur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Guru Nanak emphasized spiritual growth, his teachings did not prioritize renunciation of worldly possessions above all else.  He stressed honest work ("Kirat Karo") and sharing wealth ("Vand Chhako") as integral parts of spiritual life. This statement misrepresents the core tenets of Sikhism by overemphasizing one aspect while ignoring others.

Statement 2 is incorrect. "Seva" (selfless service) is a central pillar of Sikhism, highly emphasized by Guru Nanak and integral to the Sikh ethos.  This statement downplays the importance of a fundamental Sikh principle, aiming to confuse candidates familiar with the basic principles.

Statement 3 is correct.  The community meal, "guru ka langar," was indeed initiated by Guru Nanak at Kartarpur. This detail is specific and less widely known than the broader principles of Sikhism, making it a more challenging fact to recall accurately.  The incorrect statements serve as effective distractors.


**4. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago primarily focused on promoting Yoga as a physical exercise.
2. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which primarily focuses on religious discourse and philosophical debates.
3. Swami Vivekananda significantly influenced Jamsetji Tata in establishing the Indian Institute of Science (IISC).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of Religions was a landmark event showcasing Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism to a global audience.  It went far beyond a simple discussion of yoga as physical exercise.  This statement simplifies and misrepresents the scope of his influential speech.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ramakrishna Mission does involve religious discourse, it is primarily involved in extensive social service activities, running hospitals, schools, and other charitable institutions.  This statement narrows the mission's activities to a single aspect, neglecting its broader humanitarian work.

Statement 3 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's influence on Jamsetji Tata is well-documented and led to the inspiration behind the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science. This is a less commonly known detail about his impact, making it a good test of specific knowledge.  The incorrect statements serve as strong distractors.


**5. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw the decline of Maheshwar as a center of trade and commerce in Malwa.
2. She significantly patronized the Marathi poet Moropant, known for his political commentary on the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
3.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar primarily focused on temple reconstruction and neglected other aspects of social development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar established Maheshwar as the seat of the Holkar dynasty and significantly boosted its trade and commerce.  This statement presents the opposite of her actual contribution, creating a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Her patronage of Moropant and other artists is well-established.  This fact is specific enough to be challenging but still within the realm of reasonable recall for those familiar with her reign.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While temple reconstruction was a significant part of her contributions, she also actively promoted women's education, widow remarriage, and worked against social evils like Sati and untouchability.  This statement presents an incomplete and inaccurate portrayal of her multifaceted social reforms.  The question tests not just factual knowledge but also the ability to evaluate the completeness of a historical description.


**1. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, after becoming the ruler of Malwa, appointed her biological son as the commander of her army.
2.  The Holkar Dynasty was not a part of the Maratha Confederacy.
3. Malhar Rao Holkar II played a significant role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, leading to the Treaty of Mandsaur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar appointed Tukoji Rao Holkar, the adopted son of Malhar Rao Holkar (her father-in-law), as the commander of her army, not her biological son.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Holkar Dynasty was a prominent member of the Maratha Confederacy, a loose alliance of Maratha powers. Statement 3 is correct. Malhar Rao Holkar II's role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819) led to his defeat at the Battle of Mahidpur and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, which significantly altered the relationship between the Holkars and the British.  The Treaty of Mandsaur marked a shift in power dynamics, bringing the Holkar state under significant British influence. This event is a crucial aspect of understanding the decline of Maratha power and the rise of British dominance in India.


**2. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati established the Arya Samaj with the primary aim of reforming Buddhism.
2. The Arya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to actively engage in proselytization.
3. The split in the Arya Samaj in 1892 was primarily due to disagreements over dietary practices and the language of instruction in educational institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, aimed at reforming Hinduism, not Buddhism.  Statement 2 is correct. The Arya Samaj was indeed a pioneering Hindu organization in actively promoting its faith through proselytization – a relatively uncommon practice within traditional Hinduism at the time.  This aspect of the Arya Samaj's approach is significant in understanding its impact on the religious landscape of 19th-century India. Statement 3 is correct.  The 1892 split within the Arya Samaj was largely due to differing views on promoting specific languages (leading to a conservative versus radical faction) and prescribed dietary practices for followers. These internal disagreements highlight the complexities of religious reform movements and their adaptation to different social and cultural contexts.


**3. With reference to the Sangam Age, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangam literature extensively details the concept of 'Karma' as a determinant of social standing.
2.  The three Sangams were all located in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.
3.  'Vattakirutal,' a ritual of fasting until death, was a widespread practice during the Sangam age.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sangam literature does discuss social stratification (Varna), it doesn't center on the concept of Karma as a primary determinant of social status in the way later Hindu philosophical traditions do. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the first and third Sangams were located in Madurai, the second Sangam was held in Kapadapuram, Tamil Nadu, not Madurai. Statement 3 is correct.  'Vattakirutal,' a ritualistic fast unto death, was indeed a prevalent practice during the Sangam age, reflecting certain social and religious beliefs of the time. The practice of 'Vattakirutal' provides valuable insights into the socio-religious dynamics of the Sangam Age and its understanding of death and the afterlife. The prevalence of this practice underscores the need for further investigation into the social and religious contexts of the Sangam Age.


**4. With reference to the Kakori Conspiracy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action was primarily organized by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
2. The primary objective of the Kakori Train Action was to assassinate key British officials.
3. The Kakori Train Action took place in 1926.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train Action was indeed orchestrated by members of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). The HRA's involvement highlights its revolutionary activities and the methods employed during the Indian freedom struggle. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the action was revolutionary, the primary objective was to rob the train to fund their revolutionary activities, not specifically to assassinate British officials. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kakori Train Action occurred in 1925, not 1926. The correct year is crucial for accurate historical understanding and avoids potential misrepresentations of the event's timeline. The precise dating of the event is essential for a proper analysis of its context within the broader narrative of the Indian independence movement.


**5. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion was primarily a response to the British implementation of the Permanent Settlement.
2. Karl Marx described the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution.
3. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 was enacted as a direct consequence of the rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion was not directly triggered by the Permanent Settlement but rather by a complex interplay of factors, including issues of land alienation, exploitation by moneylenders, and the increasing encroachment of British administrative control. Statement 2 is correct. Karl Marx did indeed characterize the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution, acknowledging its significance in the context of India's resistance to colonial rule.  Statement 3 is correct. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 was a direct response to the rebellion, aiming to address some of the grievances that fueled the uprising and to try to control the situation.  The act's provisions are important for understanding the British colonial administration's response to peasant uprisings and the long-term consequences for the Santhal community.


**6. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha Famine was also known as the "Na-Anka Famine" because it occurred during the tenth regnal year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva.
2. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, the Commissioner of Odisha division during the famine, played a significant role in mitigating the impact of the famine.
3. The construction of the Puri Canal was a direct consequence of the 1866 Odisha Famine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Odisha Famine of 1866 was known as the "Na-Anka Famine" (meaning "Nine-Year Famine") because it occurred during the ninth regnal year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva, not the tenth.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ravenshaw did establish schools and colleges, his role in mitigating the famine itself is highly debated and considered to have been inadequate by many historians. His actions are often seen as insufficient to prevent the catastrophic loss of life during the famine.  Statement 3 is correct. The construction of the Puri Canal was indeed initiated as a direct response to the famine of 1866, aimed at improving irrigation and reducing the vulnerability of the region to future famines.  The canal's construction represents a significant infrastructural development project undertaken in response to the devastating consequences of the famine.


**7. With reference to the Battle of Saragarhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Saragarhi involved 21 Sikh soldiers from the 36th Sikh Regiment against approximately 10,000 Afridi and Orakzai tribals.
2. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought in the North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan).
3. All 21 Sikh soldiers who fought in the Battle of Saragarhi were awarded the Victoria Cross.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the battle involved 21 Sikh soldiers from the 36th Sikh Regiment, the number of opposing Afridi and Orakzai tribals is estimated to have been around 8,000, not 10,000.  Statement 2 is correct. The battle was indeed fought in the North-West Frontier Province, a strategically important region during British rule in India.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While all 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, the highest British gallantry award given to Indian troops at that time, they were not awarded the Victoria Cross.  The distinction between the two awards is important for accurately understanding the recognition given to the bravery of these soldiers.  The awards they received highlight the recognition of their extraordinary courage and sacrifice.


**8.  With reference to Jyotirmath, consider the following statements:**

1. Jyotirmath is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Ramanujacharya.
2.  Jyotirmath is considered the winter abode of Lord Badrinath.
3. Jyotirmath is located in the state of Himachal Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jyotirmath is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya, not Ramanujacharya.  Statement 2 is correct. Jyotirmath serves as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath, an important aspect of its religious significance. Statement 3 is incorrect. Jyotirmath is located in the state of Uttarakhand, not Himachal Pradesh. The geographical location is crucial for understanding its strategic importance and accessibility. The precise location is necessary to avoid any confusion regarding its geographical context.  The correct location helps in understanding its accessibility and importance within the broader Himalayan region.


**9. With reference to the Alagar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alagar Temple is located on the banks of the Cauvery River.
2. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, worshipped as Kallazhagar.
3. The Alagar Temple is mentioned in the Tamil epic Silappathikaram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alagar Temple is located on the foothills of the Alagar Hills in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, not on the banks of the Cauvery River. Statement 2 is correct.  The temple is indeed dedicated to Lord Vishnu, who is worshipped there as Kallazhagar.  Statement 3 is correct. The Alagar Temple is mentioned in the Tamil epic Silappathikaram, adding to its historical and cultural significance.  The mention in Silappathikaram provides valuable insights into the temple's historical context and its importance within the broader Tamil literary tradition.  The epic's reference to the temple helps situate it within a larger narrative of Tamil history and culture.


**10. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was born in a Kshatriya family.
2. He was a significant contributor to the development of Mumbai's infrastructure.
3. He donated land for the establishment of schools, with a particular focus on boys' education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was born into a Brahmin family, not a Kshatriya family.  Statement 2 is correct.  He played a crucial role in shaping Mumbai's urban landscape, contributing significantly to its infrastructure development.  His contributions are a significant part of Mumbai's history and urban development. Statement 3 is incorrect. While he did donate land for schools, his philanthropy also strongly emphasized education for girls, not solely boys. His commitment to girls' education is noteworthy in the context of his time.  His focus on girls' education is a crucial aspect of his legacy and challenges conventional gender roles prevalent in 19th-century India.


**1. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standardized weights and measures system used in the Indus Valley Civilization suggests a well-organized trade network.
2.  Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as "Meluha" and mention Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) as intermediate trading stations.
3.  The Indus Valley Civilization primarily exported precious stones and imported grains and pottery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The discovery of standardized weights and measures across various Indus Valley Civilization sites strongly indicates a sophisticated and organized system of trade and commerce. This uniformity facilitated fair transactions and efficient distribution of goods.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Mesopotamian texts, notably those from the Sumerian civilization, do refer to the Indus region as "Meluha," highlighting the existence of trade relations between the two regions. Dilmun and Makan are identified as intermediary points in this trade network, facilitating the exchange of goods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The direction of trade was primarily the opposite of what is stated.  The Indus Valley Civilization exported goods like grain, jewelry, and pottery, while importing items such as thin copper and precious stones.  This indicates that the Indus Valley Civilization had access to resources and skills not readily available within their region.  The presence of items like lapis lazuli, which originated far away, further supports this conclusion.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola navy under Rajendra I conquered regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly expanding their empire's reach.
2.  Nagapattinam served as a major port city for the Chola empire, facilitating extensive maritime trade.
3.  The Cholas primarily relied on land-based military campaigns and had limited involvement in naval expeditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's naval campaigns were pivotal in extending the Chola empire's influence across Southeast Asia. His expeditions resulted in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, establishing the Chola presence in these regions and facilitating trade and cultural exchange. This demonstrates the Chola's mastery of naval warfare and their ambition for overseas expansion.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nagapattinam was indeed a crucial port city for the Chola Empire. Its strategic location facilitated extensive maritime trade, connecting the Cholas with other regions of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and even further afield. The port's prosperity contributed significantly to the Chola economy and their overall power.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Cholas were known for their powerful navy and significant naval expeditions. Their maritime prowess was crucial to their control of trade routes and their expansion into Southeast Asia, as evidenced by their conquests and the extensive trade network they established.  Their naval strength was a key element of their military and economic power.


**3. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed to no longer be of national importance.
2. The Act defines "missing monuments" as those that cannot be located and are therefore excluded from protection.
3.  Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and places of national importance, providing a constitutional basis for the AMASR Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for the protection and preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites in India.  A key provision of the Act allows the Central Government to delist monuments that are assessed as no longer being of national importance.  This is a crucial aspect of the Act, as it allows for flexibility in managing the large number of protected sites and focusing resources on those that are truly significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The term "missing monuments" is not a defined term within the AMASR Act itself. While the Act deals with the protection of monuments, the issue of "missing" or "untraceable" monuments arises from practical challenges in locating and managing all designated sites.  The fact that a monument is "untraceable" does not necessarily mean it is excluded from protection under the Act.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution falls under the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSPs).  It mandates the state to protect monuments and objects of national importance. This constitutional provision forms the underlying principle upon which the AMASR Act is based, providing a broader legal and ethical context for the preservation of India's cultural heritage.


**4. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative focuses on producing premium quality Indian cotton with 100% traceability and certification.  The use of blockchain technology is a key aspect of this initiative, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain.  This enhanced traceability aims to improve the brand's reputation and increase consumer trust.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) serves as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  This reflects the importance of collaboration between government bodies and industry stakeholders in promoting and developing the Indian cotton sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The aim of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is precisely the opposite – to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.  By focusing on quality, traceability, and certification, the initiative seeks to improve the brand's image and appeal in international markets. This is a strategic move to increase exports and improve the overall economic benefits of the cotton sector.


**5. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI is a Ministry of Culture initiative executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.
2.  The project aims to promote the democratization of art through public installations, transforming urban landscapes into accessible galleries.
3.  Project PARI's first intervention is taking place in Mumbai, focusing on showcasing contemporary art forms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This collaboration brings together key players in the Indian art world to execute the project effectively and reach a wider audience.

Statement 2 is also correct. The core objective of Project PARI is to democratize art by bringing public art installations into urban spaces.  This is a significant step towards making art more accessible to the general public, transforming public areas into vibrant and engaging spaces.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the project aims to showcase various art forms from different regions of India, the first intervention is actually taking place in Delhi, not Mumbai.  This location was chosen strategically to maximize the project's impact and visibility.  The selection of Delhi as the starting point highlights the project's significance and the government's commitment to promoting art and culture.


**1. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by focusing solely on increasing production volume.
2.  The Cotton Corporation of India is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.
3.  Blockchain technology is utilized to ensure the traceability and certification of Kasturi Cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While increasing production is a beneficial outcome, the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative primarily focuses on enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through improved quality, traceability, and certification, not just volume.  The aim is to create a sustainable ecosystem and improve branding, not just production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The implementing agency is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), not solely the Cotton Corporation of India.  The initiative is a joint effort involving multiple stakeholders.

Statement 3 is correct.  Blockchain technology is a crucial element of the initiative, providing a transparent and secure system for tracking and verifying the origin and quality of Kasturi Cotton, ensuring its authenticity and premium status in the global market. This enhances consumer trust and brand value.

This is a significant move towards decolonization, replacing a colonial symbol with one that is more representative of the Indian context.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The sword, a traditional symbol of Lady Justice representing punishment and enforcement, has been replaced with the Indian Constitution.  This symbolizes the supremacy of the Constitution and the grounding of justice in constitutional values rather than solely punitive measures.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha lasted for 604 days, not 700.

Precision in dates and details is critical for UPSC-level understanding.

Statement 2 is correct. T.K. Madhavan, a prominent figure in the Kerala Congress, did indeed raise the issue of temple entry for Dalits in a 1917 editorial in his newspaper, "Deshabhimani." This highlights the early advocacy for social justice within the Indian independence movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mahatma Gandhi actively supported the Vaikom Satyagraha, although his involvement wasn't as direct as some of the other leaders. The level of support provided was substantial, not limited or only after conclusion. His involvement shows the intersection of the independence movement and social reform movements.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain either the incorrect duration of the Satyagraha or misrepresent the level of Gandhi's involvement.

(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

This demonstrates the evolution of the anti-apartheid movement's strategies and underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of historical figures.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the year of Apartheid's establishment, the year of South Africa's UN suspension, and the nature of Mandela's early activism.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion occurred between 1855 and 1856, not 1857. The rebellion's primary cause was the exploitation and oppression of the Santhals by British colonial authorities and moneylenders, not solely new land revenue policies. This emphasizes the need for accurate factual knowledge in understanding historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. The listed individuals were indeed key leaders of the Santhal Rebellion. This highlights the importance of understanding the leadership structure of such movements.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Karl Marx did refer to the Santhal Rebellion in his "Notes on Indian History," it was not an extensive analysis as part of "Das Kapital."  The reference was brief, not a comprehensive study as the statement suggests.

This design reflects the institution's connection to national identity and the Constitution's role in its functioning.

Statement 3 is correct. The insignia of the Supreme Court incorporates the Sanskrit phrase "Yato Dharmastato Jayah," which translates to "Where there is Dharma, there is victory."

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI intends to delist 18, not 24, centrally protected monuments deemed "untraceable" and lacking national importance.  Precision in numbers is crucial in factual recall questions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* define the term "missing monuments." This term emerged from the CAG audit report, highlighting the discrepancy between officially listed and physically traceable monuments.  The act focuses on the process of declaring a monument to no longer be of national importance, but doesn't use the term "missing monuments."

Statement 3 is correct. Delisting a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, means it loses its official protection and conservation status under the ASI.  This allows for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area, potentially leading to the loss or damage of the historical site.

Statement 2 is correct. K. Kelappan, known as the "Kerala Gandhi," played a significant role in the Vaikom Satyagraha, actively participating in the movement's leadership and organization.  His contribution to the struggle against caste-based discrimination is well-documented.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha did not lead to the immediate and complete removal of all caste-based restrictions on temple entry.  While it was a significant step, the full achievement of temple entry for all castes came later through the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.  The movement's success was partial, yet highly influential in the broader struggle for social justice.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus script was written in a boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), it remains undeciphered to this day.  Our understanding of their religious beliefs and social structures is based on archaeological findings and interpretations, not direct textual evidence from the script.

Mesopotamian texts refer to Meluha (the Indus region), Dilmun (Bahrain), and Makan (Makran coast), indicating established trade routes and exchanges of goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Arthashastra discusses various aspects of governance and administration, including trade and military strategies, the earliest references to maritime activities in India are found in the Rigveda, predating the Mauryan Empire by centuries.  The Arthashastra does not provide detailed information on naval strategies and trade routes of the Mauryan Empire to the extent suggested in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Satavahana dynasty's coins, featuring inscriptions and depictions of ships, provide strong evidence of their active involvement in maritime trade and their recognition of its importance. This represents the first documented instance of native Indian rulers explicitly acknowledging their maritime activities on their currency.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Gupta period saw increased trade, it was primarily with regions in Europe and Africa, not predominantly Southeast Asia. The major expansion of maritime trade with Southeast Asia is largely associated with the Chola dynasty.  The emphasis on Southeast Asia in the statement is a significant inaccuracy.

These carvings are etched into meta-basalt rocks, providing valuable insights into the artistic and cultural practices of the Neolithic people in the region.

Statement 2 is correct.  New archaeological sites have been discovered in Telangana, including the Iron Age megalithic site at Ooragutta and two additional rock art sites in Damaratogu. These discoveries contribute to our understanding of the region's prehistoric and ancient past.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chandravalli cave complex in Karnataka's Chitradurga district exhibits evidence of prehistoric and Iron Age habitation. The presence of a Shiva linga within the cave complex points towards its use as a place of worship, demonstrating the religious practices of the inhabitants.  The complex's architecture and artifacts provide further insights into their lifestyle and culture.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu. While it is situated at a confluence of rivers, the number is six, not merely two as implied. Statement 2 is correct as it accurately describes the temple's location and the dynasty responsible for its construction. The mention of five other tributaries along with Krishna and Bhavanasi is also accurate. Statement 3 is incorrect because Sangameshwar temples exist in Karnataka as well, notably one being part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site at Pattadakal.  The question tests factual recall about the specific deity, the number of rivers, the dynasty involved in the construction, and the geographical distribution of similar temples.  The distractors play on the details, changing the deity, altering the number of rivers, and limiting the geographical locations to create plausible but incorrect options.


**2. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kamakhya Temple, located on the Nilachal hills, was initially constructed in the 12th century by the Pala dynasty.
2. The Ambubachi Mela festival commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya and is celebrated in the month of July.
3. The temple's architecture is a unique blend of Nilachal, Pala, and Ahom styles, reflecting influences from Upper Burma and Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts: the temple's original construction date is not precisely 12th Century and it was not built by the Pala dynasty. The Koch dynasty reconstructed the temple in the mid-16th century. Statement 2 is partially correct in that it correctly identifies the festival and its significance. However, the exact month is not specified in the provided text, making it a slightly misleading statement. Statement 3 is correct; it accurately describes the architectural fusion present in the Kamakhya Temple. The blend of styles, including influences from Upper Burma and Bengal, is explicitly mentioned in the source material. The question highlights the need for precise factual recall regarding the temple's construction history, the festival's details, and the architectural influences.  The distractors subtly alter historical details and timelines to create plausible but ultimately incorrect options.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's zenith was attained during the rule of the Sangama dynasty, marked by the acquisition of the Raichur doab.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas, military commanders, were granted territories to rule but had no control over taxation within their assigned regions.
3.  Krishnadevaraya's court comprised eight scholars known as 'Ashtadiggajaru', representing diverse fields of expertise, and he authored 'Amuktamalyada' a work focused on military strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Raichur doab was acquired during Krishnadevaraya's reign, the empire's zenith was reached during the Tuluva dynasty, not the Sangama dynasty. Statement 2 is incorrect because Amara-Nayakas did indeed collect taxes within their territories, retaining a portion for personal use and maintaining infrastructure like temples and irrigation works.  Statement 3 is mostly correct. Krishnadevaraya's court did indeed have the 'Ashtadiggajaru,' representing diverse scholarly fields. However, 'Amuktamalyada' is a work on statecraft, not solely military strategy. The question assesses the understanding of the Vijayanagara Empire's political structure, administrative system, and the contribution of its key rulers. The distractors manipulate details about the ruling dynasties, the administrative roles of the Amara-Nayakas, and the content of Krishnadevaraya's literary works to create plausible but inaccurate options.


**4. With reference to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, consider the following statements:**

1. The project's primary objective was to create a direct pathway connecting the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the river Yamuna.
2.  The project involved the restoration of several smaller temples surrounding the main temple, including the Sheetla Mata Temple and the Shri Ram Temple.
3.  The Economic Survey of 2023-24 reported a significant increase in India's foreign exchange earnings from tourism, exceeding ₹2.3 lakh crore year-on-year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project connected the temple to the banks of the Ganga river, not the Yamuna. Statement 2 is correct; the project encompassed the restoration of smaller temples in the vicinity.  Statement 3 is correct; the Economic Survey data on tourism revenue is accurately cited. The question tests knowledge of the project's core goals, its scope, and its broader economic impact. The distractors include an incorrect river and a misrepresentation of the project's scale to create plausible, yet incorrect, response options.


**5. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, consider the following statements:**

1. The main temple's architecture is a distinct blend of Dravida and Nagara styles, characterized by a curvilinear shikhara.
2. The Vajrasana, a polished sandstone platform, marks the spot where Emperor Asoka meditated.
3.  The complex includes seven sacred sites, among which are the Sacred Bodhi Tree and the Animeshlochan Chaitya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple's architecture is described as neither purely Dravida nor Nagara, possessing unique characteristics. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vajrasana marks the spot where Buddha meditated, not Emperor Asoka. Statement 3 is correct; the seven sacred sites are accurately listed. This question tests detailed knowledge of the temple's architecture, historical significance, and associated sacred locations. The distractors incorrectly combine architectural styles, misattribute the Vajrasana's significance, and alter the list of sacred sites to create plausible but incorrect options.


**6. With reference to  temple architecture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagara style of temple architecture is characterized by a stepped pyramid-shaped Vimana and the presence of large water reservoirs.
2.  The Vesara style, patronized by the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Hoysalas, combines features of both Nagara and Dravida styles, but lacks a covered ambulatory around the sanctum.
3. The Dravida style features a curvilinear shikhara, a small Garbhagriha tower, and Dvarapalas (door-keepers) sculptures guarding the temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagara style has a curvilinear shikhara, not a stepped pyramid-shaped Vimana, and typically lacks large water reservoirs.  Statement 2 is correct; it accurately describes the Vesara style's characteristics and its patrons. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Dravida style has a stepped pyramid-shaped Vimana, not a curvilinear shikhara. While it does feature a small Garbhagriha tower and Dvarapalas, these features are not exclusive to the Dravida style. The question tests the understanding of the distinct features of different Indian temple architectural styles.  The distractors deliberately interchange characteristics between styles and add or remove features to create plausible but incorrect options.



**7. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended to Sri Lanka, the Sailendra Empire, and the Maldives, resulting in the annexation of significant territories.
2. The Chola Empire's "Look East Policy" focused on establishing trade relations with Southeast Asian countries through the Bay of Bengal, which they controlled entirely.
3. Nagapattinam served as a major trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating trade with countries in Southeast Asia and beyond, but was not a significant naval base.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra I's extensive naval conquests are accurately described. Statement 2 is partially correct in that the Chola Empire did have a "Look East Policy" and utilized the Bay of Bengal for trade. However,  describing their control over the Bay of Bengal as "entire" is an overstatement.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Nagapattinam was a vital trading center, but it also held significant strategic importance as a naval base. The question examines knowledge of the Chola Empire's maritime expansion, trade networks, and strategic locations. The distractors exaggerate the extent of Chola control, misrepresent Nagapattinam's role, and subtly alter the details of the "Look East Policy" to create plausible but inaccurate options.


**8. With reference to the  World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities, primarily practiced in the Himalayas and the plains of India.
2. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) leads the initiative, supported by Nepal.
3. In 2023, two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, including one from India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition of transhumance and its prevalence in India are accurately described. Statement 2 is incorrect. While ICOMOS leads the initiative, it is supported by Azerbaijan, not Nepal. Statement 3 is correct. Two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages, though neither was specifically from India.  The question assesses understanding of the transhumance practice, the initiative's leadership, and its recognition by UNESCO. The distractors incorrectly identify the supporting country and the specific geographical location of the recognized traditions to create plausible yet incorrect options.


**9. With reference to the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.
2. Manuscripts of three Indian literary works—Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana—were included in the 2023 Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Beijing, China, where the decision to include the Indian manuscripts was made.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The details of the MoW Programme and its registers are accurately described. Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of the Indian manuscripts is accurately stated. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 10th MOWCAP meeting did indeed lead to this decision, it was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  The question tests knowledge of the MoW Programme, its structure, and recent inclusions from India.  The distractors incorrectly identify the location of the MOWCAP meeting and subtly alter the details of the inclusion process to create plausible but ultimately incorrect options.


**10. With reference to the  Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib is located in the district of Narowal, Pakistan, approximately 4.5 km from the international border near Dera Baba Nanak in Punjab, India.

3.  The corridor facilitates pilgrimage for Sikh devotees from India to visit Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The location details of Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib are accurately described. Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement was extended for five years, not ten. Statement 3 is correct; the corridor's purpose is accurately stated.  The question tests knowledge of the geographical location, the agreement's details, and the corridor's primary function.  The distractor manipulates the duration of the agreement extension to create a plausible but incorrect option.


**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act empowers the Central Government to delist ancient monuments deemed no longer of national importance, allowing for regular construction and urbanization in the affected areas.
2.  The Act mandates the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to maintain a comprehensive register of all "missing monuments," facilitating their rediscovery and preservation.
3. Section 4 of the AMASR Act exclusively deals with the protection of sculptures and carvings found within nationally protected monuments, excluding other architectural elements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that cease to be of national importance (Section 35). This allows for the resumption of construction and other activities in the area.  The delisting process is based on assessments of the monument's significance and condition.  The ASI's role shifts from preservation to allowing other land use.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act does not specifically define or mandate the maintenance of a register for "missing monuments." The term "missing monuments" is not part of the Act's official terminology; it's a term used informally in discussions about untraceable or lost monuments. The ASI's focus is on the protection of known and identified monuments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Section 4 of the AMASR Act is broader than just sculptures and carvings. While it addresses the protection of such elements, it also encompasses the protection of the entire monument and its archaeological significance, including the structures themselves. The Act's purpose is the preservation of the complete historical site.


**2. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The establishment of Nalanda University was directly influenced by the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2006, which highlighted the need for a centre of inter-civilisational dialogue.
2.  The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, primarily focused on religious studies, offering limited instruction in secular subjects like medicine and astronomy.
3.  The modern Nalanda University, inaugurated recently, is a "Net Zero Green Campus," aligning with principles of environmental sustainability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was influenced by discussions at East Asia Summits, it was the 2nd EAS in 2007, not the 1st, that provided the impetus.  The idea of reviving Nalanda as a centre of learning emerged from broader discussions about regional cooperation and academic exchange.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While religious studies, particularly Buddhism in its various forms, were central to Nalanda's curriculum, it was far from limited to religious subjects. The ancient university offered a wide range of disciplines, including medicine, astronomy, politics, fine arts, and even war strategy.  It attracted scholars from across Asia, indicating a diverse and comprehensive curriculum.

Statement 3 is correct.  The newly inaugurated Nalanda University campus is designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus," emphasizing environmental sustainability and minimizing its carbon footprint. This reflects a modern approach to education and aligns with global concerns about climate change and responsible development.



**3. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially known as "State Awards" and were first presented in 1955, with a focus on recognizing only feature films of national importance.
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has been responsible for administering the National Film Awards since 1973, expanding the award categories to include non-feature films and best writing on cinema.
3. The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is presented as a separate award from the National Film Awards, recognizing states that have actively promoted the growth of the film industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The National Film Awards were indeed initially called "State Awards," but their inception year was 1954, not 1955.  Also, from the beginning, the awards were not limited to only feature films of national importance. While feature films were a significant part, the awards also considered other categories from the early years.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directorate of Film Festivals assumed responsibility for administering the National Film Awards in 1973.  This period also witnessed an expansion of the award categories to include non-feature films and best writing on cinema, reflecting the evolving landscape of Indian cinema.

Statement 3 is correct. The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is presented separately from the core National Film Awards. It is a distinct recognition given to states that have fostered a supportive environment for film production and industry growth. This award acknowledges the crucial role of state governments in supporting the film industry's development.


**4. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles Award, established in 2010, is a biennial award recognizing architectural projects that showcase sustainable design principles and reflect local heritage.
2.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in Gujarat, India, won the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in the "Museums" category in 2023, highlighting its innovative design and ecological efficiency.
3. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru was previously recognized with the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, demonstrating India's growing contribution to sustainable architecture.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award was established in 2015, not 2010, and it is an annual, not biennial, award.  While the award does recognize sustainable design and local heritage,  the statement misrepresents the founding year and frequency of the award.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was shortlisted for the award but did not win in 2023.  The statement incorrectly states that it won the award.  Shortlisting is a significant achievement, but it does not equate to winning the award.

Statement 3 is correct. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in 2023, demonstrating India's contributions to sustainable and aesthetically pleasing architecture in the field of transportation infrastructure.  This highlights the international recognition of Indian architectural projects.


**5. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government initiative aimed at promoting the export of Indian cotton by leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced traceability and certification.
2. The Cotton Corporation of India is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, ensuring consistent quality control and global competitiveness.
3. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand utilizes blockchain technology to track the cotton's journey from farm to final product, enhancing transparency and consumer trust.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is indeed a government initiative focusing on improving the competitiveness of Indian cotton in the global market.  The use of blockchain technology is a key element, enhancing traceability and allowing for better certification processes.  The aim is to improve the overall quality and reputation of Indian cotton.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, it is not the sole implementing agency. The initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, various trade bodies, and industry stakeholders.  This collaborative approach ensures a more comprehensive and effective implementation strategy.

Statement 3 is correct. The core of Kasturi Cotton Bharat is the use of blockchain technology. This allows for complete traceability, tracking the cotton's journey from the farm to the final product.  This transparency builds trust among consumers and buyers, enhancing the brand's reputation and market appeal.  The blockchain technology addresses concerns about the authenticity and quality of the cotton.


**1. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was established in 1927 with its headquarters in Mumbai.
2. The IOA's primary function is to send Indian teams to the Commonwealth Games only.
3. Sir Dorabji Tata served as the first President of the IOA, recognized by the IOC in the same year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while the IOA was indeed founded in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first President and recognized by the IOC the same year, its headquarters are not in Mumbai.  The passage does not specify its location.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the IOA coordinates with National Sports Federations to send Indian teams to the Olympics and *other* international games, not solely the Commonwealth Games.  Statement 3 is correct as the passage explicitly states this fact. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**2. With reference to initiatives promoting the sports ecosystem in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The budgetary allocation for sports has remained static since 2014-15.
2. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program focuses on athletes aged between 15 and 25 years.
3. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provides only financial assistance to athletes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly mentions that budgetary allocation for sports has nearly doubled from 2014-15 to 2023-24. Statement 2 is incorrect. The KIRTI program targets school children aged between 9 and 18 years, not 15-25. Statement 3 is incorrect. TOPS offers comprehensive assistance, including funding, specialized equipment, international exposure, top-tier coaching, and a monthly allowance, not just financial aid.  Thus, none of the statements are correct.


**3. With reference to India's performance in recent sporting events, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Olympic ranking improved from Tokyo 2020 to Paris 2024.
2. India won more medals in Paris 2024 than in Tokyo 2020.
3. India's performance in Paris 2024 was its best Olympic performance ever.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; India's Olympic ranking fell from 48th in Tokyo to 71st in Paris. Statement 2 is also incorrect; India won six medals in Paris (one silver, five bronze), fewer than the seven medals won in Tokyo (one gold, two silver, four bronze). Statement 3 is incorrect; Paris 2024 was India's third-best Olympic performance, not its best. Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**4. With reference to the Olympic Games, consider the following statements:**

1. The Olympic Games were first held in 1900 in Paris.
2. The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger).
3. The Olympic flag features five interlocking rings representing the five continents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896 in Athens, Greece, not 1900 in Paris. Statement 2 is correct. The Olympic motto is indeed "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger). Statement 3 is also correct. The five interlocking rings on the Olympic flag symbolize the five parts of the world, often interpreted as the five continents.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about Abhinav Bindra:**

1. Abhinav Bindra won India's first ever Olympic gold medal in team event.
2. Abhinav Bindra has been awarded the Olympic Order for his contributions to the Olympic Movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Abhinav Bindra won India's first *individual* Olympic gold medal, not a team event.  Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that he received the Olympic Order. Statement 3 is incorrect. He won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, not the 2012 London Olympics.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Commonwealth Games (CWG), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWG 2026 will be held in London.
2.  Six sports in which India won medals at the 2022 CWG were dropped from the 2026 edition.
3. The first CWG was held in 1920.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the CWG 2026 will be held in Glasgow, not London. Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that six disciplines in which India won medals at the 2022 CWG were removed from the 2026 edition. Statement 3 is incorrect. The first CWG was held in 1930, not 1920.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the 2024 T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 T20 World Cup was jointly hosted by India and Pakistan.
2. The final match was played between India and Australia.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention Pakistan's involvement in hosting the 2024 T20 World Cup; it was held in the USA and West Indies. Statement 2 is incorrect. The final match was between India and South Africa, not Australia. Statement 3 is incorrect. The ICC's headquarters are in Dubai, UAE, not London.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rajaraja and Rajendra I's aggressive military policies significantly expanded Chola control, including their influence in Southeast Asia through naval power.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Nagapattinam, located in present-day Tamil Nadu, India, was a major trading center for the Chola Empire, not Sri Lanka. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chola navy was instrumental in establishing dominance over the Bay of Bengal, transforming it into what was described as a "Chola lake". Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

3. The Padma Awards are typically not given posthumously.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, not 1960. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Padma Vibhushan is a very high civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna is considered the highest. Statement 3 is correct. The passage notes that Padma Awards are normally not given posthumously, though exceptions can be made.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.  However, the phrasing in the passage allows for the possibility of posthumous awards in exceptional cases, making (d) the most accurate answer.


**10. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Defence.
2. The awards are based on write-ups submitted by retired central government employees.
3. The aim of the Anubhav Awards is to improve the efficiency of the Indian Armed Forces.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Defence. Statement 2 is correct. The awards are indeed based on write-ups (Anubhav) submitted by retiring central government employees and pensioners. Statement 3 is incorrect. The aim is to foster good governance and administrative reforms, not to improve the efficiency of the Indian Armed Forces. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola Empire's naval dominance facilitated extensive trade with Southeast Asia, primarily through the port of Mahabalipuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is accurate. Rajendra I's ambitious naval campaigns significantly expanded Chola territory, reaching the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia.  His conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra marked a high point of Chola naval power and influence.  The text explicitly mentions this conquest.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I was a powerful naval ruler, the text specifies his destruction of the *Chera* navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai. This is a crucial distinction, demonstrating the need for precise factual recall.  Confusing the Chera and Pandya kingdoms is a common error, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge of South Indian history.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While Nagapattinam is explicitly mentioned as a key trading center of the Chola empire, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia, the statement incorrectly cites Mahabalipuram. Mahabalipuram, while a significant port in earlier periods, was not the primary center of Chola maritime trade during the reign of Rajaraja I and Rajendra I. This demonstrates the need for accurate association of geographical locations with specific historical periods and empires.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between significant ports in South India and accurately link them to the relevant historical context.


**2. With reference to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), consider the following statements:**

1. ICOMOS, based in Paris, France, is a non-governmental organization dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage sites.
2. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, supported by ICOMOS and Azerbaijan, focuses on the traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement.
3.  In 2023, ICOMOS declared the transhumance traditions of the Himalayas, specifically involving the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the text's information regarding the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative and its support from ICOMOS and Azerbaijan. The initiative's focus on the traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement is correctly stated.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ICOMOS is indeed a non-governmental organization dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage sites, the text does not specify its location as Paris, France.  This highlights the importance of not making assumptions based on general knowledge and instead relying on the provided information. The error serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall details from the text.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The text mentions that *two* transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023 – one in 10 European states and the other concerning Alpine pastures in Switzerland. It does not mention the Himalayan transhumance traditions being declared in 2023. This shows the need for precise factual recall and avoids generalizations. The incorrect information serves as a plausible yet incorrect option, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar yet distinct concepts.


**3. With reference to the Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Beijing, China, resulting in the inclusion of manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2.  The MOW Programme, launched in 1994, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.
3. The Ramcharitmanas, an epic poem written in Sanskrit by Goswami Tulsidas, is among the Indian literary works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The passage states that the MOW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  This is a straightforward fact that tests the candidate's ability to recall details accurately.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  This demonstrates the importance of paying close attention to details and avoiding assumptions.  The incorrect location serves as a plausible yet incorrect option.

Statement 3 is also incorrect. While the Ramcharitmanas is indeed included in the register, it is incorrectly stated to be written in Sanskrit. The text explicitly states that it is written in Awadhi.  This error highlights the necessity of precise factual knowledge. The incorrect language serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's familiarity with the work's linguistic context.  The question thereby tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall the language and author of a significant literary work.


**4. With reference to the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 T20 World Cup final was held in Australia, with India defeating England to win the title for the third time.
2. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in London, England, organizes the T20 World Cup.
3. The T20 format of cricket, introduced in 2003, involves a maximum of 20 overs per team.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The passage states that the T20 format involves a maximum of 20 overs per team. This is a basic factual detail.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that India won the 2024 T20 World Cup by defeating South Africa in a final held in the USA and West Indies, not Australia, and it was their second win, not their third. This demonstrates the need for accurate recall of details, including the location and opponent in the final match.  The incorrect details serve as strong distractors.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The ICC headquarters are in Dubai, UAE, not London, England, as stated in the passage. The error serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of international sports organizations and their locations.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the T20 World Cup and its governing body.



**5. With reference to the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi's contributions to the AAM included establishing the African National Congress (ANC) in 1894.
2. The Indian government's support for the AAM involved being the first nation to impose economic sanctions on South Africa in 1946.
3. Yusuf Dadoo played a significant role in the AAM, founding and leading the Non-European United Front.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo's key role in founding and leading the Non-European United Front and his involvement with the Communist Party during the apartheid era.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures in the anti-apartheid struggle.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mahatma Gandhi's influence on the AAM is undeniable, he established the *Natal Indian Congress*, not the African National Congress (ANC), in 1894.  This factual inaccuracy serves as a crucial distractor.  The question tests the ability to distinguish between different organizations involved in the struggle.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text states that India was the first country to sever trade relations with the apartheid government in 1946, not impose economic sanctions. This subtle difference is important, highlighting the need for precise wording and understanding of international relations terminology.  The incorrect phrasing acts as a strong distractor. The question thereby assesses the candidate's understanding of India's role in the AAM and its nuanced relationship with South Africa during the apartheid era.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval conquests included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka.
2.  Rajendra I's reign saw the expansion of Chola influence to Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake".
3.  Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia under their "Look East" policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Rajaraja I did conquer northern Sri Lanka and conduct significant naval campaigns,  the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The conquest of the Chera navy is a key aspect of Chola naval dominance. The other part of statement 1 is correct.

Statement 2 is accurate. Rajendra I significantly expanded the Chola Empire's naval reach, conquering territories in Southeast Asia, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. His naval prowess effectively controlled the Bay of Bengal, earning it the moniker "Chola lake," a testament to Chola maritime power and its impact on regional trade and geopolitics.

Statement 3 is also correct. Nagapattinam's strategic location facilitated extensive trade between the Chola Empire and Southeast Asia.  The "Look East" policy, while not explicitly named as such in the provided text, is implicitly demonstrated by the extensive trade network extending to Southeast Asia, reflecting an outward-looking economic strategy.  Nagapattinam's role as a major port highlights the importance of maritime trade in the Chola economy and its engagement with the wider Asian world.


**2. With reference to the International Cricket Council (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICC, headquartered in Dubai, UAE, launched the T20 World Cup in 2007, establishing it as the premier international Twenty20 cricket championship.
2.  The ICC is responsible for organizing only the T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy, excluding other major international tournaments.
3.  The T20 World Cup format involves a maximum of 20 overs per team, making it a shorter format of cricket compared to One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Test matches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that the ICC, based in Dubai, introduced the T20 World Cup in 2007 and positions it as the leading international tournament for Twenty20 cricket. This statement accurately reflects the ICC's role and the T20 World Cup's significance in the cricketing world.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the text mentions the T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy, it also explicitly states that the ICC organizes other major international tournaments, including the World Test Championship. This statement incorrectly limits the ICC's organizational responsibilities.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the T20 World Cup format as a shorter version of cricket, with a maximum of 20 overs per team.  This differentiates it from longer formats like ODIs and Test matches, highlighting the unique aspects of the T20 format.



**3. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1.  The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram signifies the victory of the Indian freedom movement and highlights the strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the Chola Empire.
2.  Sri Vijaya Puram is significant because Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose unfurled the Indian flag there, and the Cellular Jail is located in the same area.
3.  The renaming marks a rejection of the colonial past and underscores the contemporary strategic role of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which served as a naval base for the Chola Empire.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the reasons behind the renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram.

Statement 1 correctly links the renaming to the Indian freedom struggle's victory and emphasizes the islands' historical and strategic significance, particularly during the Chola period.

Statement 2 accurately points out the historical importance of the location, highlighting Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's flag-hoisting ceremony and the presence of the Cellular Jail, both significant events and landmarks in Indian history.

Statement 3 correctly identifies the renaming as a symbolic rejection of the colonial past and a recognition of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' contemporary strategic importance, linking it to their historical role as a Chola naval base.  The renaming thus carries both historical and geopolitical significance.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information provided about India's Olympic performance.

Statement 1 correctly notes the decrease in India's medal count from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics to the Paris 2024 Olympics, specifically highlighting the absence of gold medals in Paris.

Statement 2 is correct in stating that despite the reduced medal count, Paris 2024 still represents India's third-best Olympic performance historically. This indicates that while the medal tally was lower than in Tokyo, it still holds a significant position in India's overall Olympic history.

Statement 3 is also correct, accurately reporting the decline in India's Olympic ranking from 48th in Tokyo 2020 to 71st in Paris 2024. This drop in ranking directly reflects the decrease in the overall medal count and overall performance compared to the previous Olympics.


**5. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register and its inclusion of Indian literary works.

Statement 1 correctly identifies the three Indian literary works – Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana – that were included in the register, highlighting India's contribution to the program.

Statement 2 is accurate in specifying the 10th meeting of the MOWCAP in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, as the forum where the decision to include these works was made. This provides the context of the decision-making process.

Statement 3 is also correct, outlining the structure of the MOW program, which operates with three registers: International, Regional, and National. This provides the broader framework within which the regional register functions.  The inclusion of the Indian manuscripts fits within this established three-tiered structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja I's significant naval victory was against the Chera navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai. The Pandyas were a separate power and while there were conflicts, the specific battle mentioned is linked to the Cheras.  Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's ambitious naval expeditions did reach the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the extent of Chola naval power and influence in Southeast Asia. Statement 3 is correct.  While the extent of Chola control over Sri Lanka fluctuated, Rajendra I's conquest did lead to a period where the entire island was under Chola administration. This showcases the Chola's dominance in the region.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

It's a practice found across various parts of India and the world, including plains regions such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.  Statement 2 is correct.  UNESCO did indeed recognize two transhumance traditions in 2023 as Intangible Cultural Heritage. Statement 3 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is led by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), not the IUCN. The IUCN focuses on nature conservation, while ICOMOS focuses on cultural heritage.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both King Harshavardhana and the Pala rulers were significant patrons of Nalanda University.  The Pala dynasty, in particular, played a crucial role in its flourishing during the 8th-12th centuries CE.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the "Dharma Gunj" library at Nalanda was indeed vast, the exact number of books and the specific details about its collection remain debated among historians.  The mention of Vedas and Theravada Buddhism in the library's holdings is plausible given the wide range of subjects taught at Nalanda, but the precise extent of the collection's contents is uncertain.

Statement 3 is correct. Aryabhatta, a pivotal figure in the history of mathematics, is traditionally associated with Nalanda.  Historical evidence suggests he studied and taught there.

(a) 1 and 2 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were executed, Rajendra Lahiri was also executed, not just given a life sentence.  The statement misrepresents the outcome for Lahiri to create confusion.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The revolutionaries in the Lahore Conspiracy Case did strategically utilize the courtroom to counter the government's portrayal of their actions, and Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were indeed executed.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Jatin Das's death during a hunger strike was a significant event that sparked widespread outrage and intensified the nationalist movement's momentum.  The statement downplays the importance of this event to serve as a distractor.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola did engage in significant naval battles and expanded Chola influence considerably,  the source text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandya kingdom was a separate entity and a rival, but the text doesn't directly mention a decisive naval defeat of the Pandyas by Rajaraja Chola.  This detail requires careful reading and understanding of the specific sources and context to avoid a common misconception.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that Rajendra Chola I's major naval expedition targeted the Sailendra Empire, resulting in conquests across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This showcases the extent of Chola maritime power and imperial ambitions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka led to the entire island becoming a *Chola province*, indicating complete annexation, not merely tributary status.  This reflects a significant difference in the level of Chola control and administration.  Understanding the nuance between tributary status and outright annexation is crucial for accurate analysis of historical events.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is led by ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites), not UNESCO, and is supported by Azerbaijan, not India.  This highlights the importance of understanding the roles of different international organizations in cultural heritage preservation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the UNESCO recognition in 2023 of transhumance traditions from ten European states and Switzerland as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.  This demonstrates the growing global appreciation for traditional pastoral practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that transhumance practices exist not only in the Himalayas but also in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. This illustrates the widespread geographical reach of this traditional practice within India, extending beyond the commonly perceived Himalayan focus.


**3. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly clarifies that the term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined within the AMASR Act; it originated from the CAG audit report. This distinction highlights the difference between official legal terminology and informal usage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does empower the Central Government to delist monuments that are assessed as no longer holding national importance.  This power reflects the dynamic nature of heritage preservation and the need to adapt to changing circumstances.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NMA was established under the AMASR Act (through an amendment), Section 4 of the original Act does not mandate its creation. The NMA's establishment came later through the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. This demonstrates the evolution of legal frameworks over time in response to changing needs.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Krishnadevaraya significantly expanded the empire's reach, it's inaccurate to say it encompassed the *entire* Deccan plateau.  The text mentions specific territorial gains during his reign but does not claim complete control over the vast Deccan region. This emphasizes the need for precise geographic understanding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Amara-Nayakas, while military commanders, *did* collect taxes and retained a portion of the revenue.  This demonstrates the decentralized nature of Vijayanagara administration.

(d) 2 and 3 only

This underscores the importance of accurate recall of names and details.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (descriptions of various temples, historical sites, and events), many questions naturally fall under the "With reference to Indian History" category.  Creating questions that strictly adhere to the other two question formats (and still meet all other criteria) while covering the diverse content comprehensively proved challenging.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent movement to secure temple entry for lower-caste Hindus, primarily focusing on the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple in Travancore (present-day Kerala). Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Satyagraha lasted for 604 days, not exactly one year. Statement 3 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori train robbery was indeed planned and executed by members of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA). Statement 2 is incorrect.

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant events in India's struggle for independence, focusing on the details of specific revolutionary activities and their participants.

(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Statement 2 is incorrect. "Untraceable monuments," as defined in the context, are those whose locations cannot be definitively confirmed, not necessarily those that are physically lost or destroyed. Statement 3 is incorrect. Delisting a monument under the AMASR Act does remove it from the ASI's direct protection and conservation efforts, but it does not necessarily mean it is completely unprotected.  Other laws or regulations might still apply depending on the specific circumstances. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the legal frameworks related to the protection of historical monuments in India. The distractors test their understanding of the process, definitions, and implications of delisting monuments.

The Chola navy's significant naval victory at Kandalursalai was against the Chera kingdom, not the Pandya kingdom. Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions did indeed reach Southeast Asia, encompassing parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly expanding the Chola empire's reach. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Chola Empire's maritime power and its impact on regional geopolitics.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the achievements of different Chola rulers and their specific targets.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is common in mountainous regions, it's also practiced in plains, utilizing seasonal variations in grazing lands.  Statement 2 is correct. The Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis are indeed nomadic pastoral communities in the Himalayas known for their traditional transhumance practices. Statement 3 is correct. Modernization and urbanization are indeed leading to a decline in traditional transhumance practices in many parts of the world due to changes in land use, infrastructure development, and economic opportunities.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of traditional pastoral practices and their challenges in a changing world.  The distractors test their knowledge of the geographical distribution of transhumance and its vulnerabilities to modern pressures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja Chola I decisively defeated the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. The Pandyas were also a significant power in South India, but this specific naval victory was against the Cheras.  This subtle difference highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While Rajendra Chola I did conquer Sri Lanka, the claim that the island became a Chola province is an oversimplification.  While significant portions of the island were under Chola control, complete annexation might not be entirely accurate; the duration of Chola control also varied over time. The statement presents a slightly exaggerated version of historical events. This demonstrates the need for nuanced understanding in evaluating historical claims.

Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions significantly impacted the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, leading to the conquest of regions within the Sailendra Empire.  This expansion of Chola power showcases their maritime prowess and the extent of their influence in Southeast Asia.  This fact demonstrates a broader understanding of the Chola Empire's geopolitical reach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is actually led by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), not UNESCO, and supported by Azerbaijan, not India. This highlights the need for precise knowledge of the organizations involved in such initiatives.  Confusing ICOMOS with UNESCO is a common distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  In 2023, UNESCO did indeed recognize transhumance traditions in Europe and Switzerland as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity. This showcases the growing recognition of traditional pastoral practices globally.  This is a straightforward fact requiring recall.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas and involves tribes like Gujars and Bakarwals, it's also found in other regions of India, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement is too narrow in its geographical scope, making it incorrect. This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive understanding of the geographical spread of practices.

Statement 2 is correct. Manuscripts of the Indian literary works Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This fact requires direct recall of the specific literary works recognized.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 10th meeting of MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  This highlights the importance of precise geographical details in UPSC-style questions.  Confusing Mongolia with China is a common error.

Statement 2 is correct. TOPS indeed provides comprehensive support to India's top athletes, encompassing funding, specialized equipment, coaching, and international exposure. This requires knowledge of the specific services offered by TOPS.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 'One School-One Sport' policy is implemented by the Ministry of Defence, specifically for Sainik Schools, not across all schools in India.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's performance in Paris 2024 was its third-best historically, it wasn't the best-ever.  This requires careful interpretation of comparative data.

Statement 2 is correct. Abhinav Bindra won India's first individual Olympic gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This is a significant fact requiring direct recall.

Statement 3 is correct. The IOA was indeed recognized by the IOC in 1927. This showcases the historical timeline of India's participation in the Olympic movement.  This is a straightforward fact requiring recall of a specific date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra, or Earth-touching Mudra, symbolizes the Buddha's calling upon the earth to witness his enlightenment, not the preaching of Dhamma.  The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra represents the preaching of the Dhamma.  This is a common point of confusion, illustrating the need for precise understanding of Buddhist mudras.

Statement 3 is correct. The Dhyana Mudra indeed symbolizes the perfect balance of thought, rest of the senses, and tranquility, indicating a meditative state. This requires understanding of the meaning and significance of specific Mudras.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and objects of national importance.  This is a fundamental constitutional provision requiring recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, does provide a mechanism for delisting monuments that are deemed to have ceased to be of national importance.  This shows the legal framework for managing the preservation of monuments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly protects sculptures, carvings, and other associated artifacts found at ancient monuments and archaeological sites. This highlights the comprehensive scope of the Act, going beyond just excavations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mahatma Gandhi's activities in South Africa laid the groundwork for anti-colonial and anti-racial discrimination movements, he did not establish the ANC. The ANC was founded by other leaders. This showcases the need to understand the roles of different individuals in historical movements.

Statement 2 is correct. Yusuf Dadoo was indeed a key figure in the Non-European United Front and the Communist Party of South Africa.  This requires knowledge of significant figures in the anti-apartheid movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India was among the first countries to sever trade relations with the apartheid government, it wasn't the first to impose comprehensive economic sanctions.  This demonstrates the need for nuanced understanding of international relations during that period.  The timeline of actions by different countries is crucial here.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was shortlisted, highlighting its architectural merit and recognition within the competition's framework.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award was established in 2015, not 2010, as stated. The other aspects of the statement regarding innovation, ecological efficiency, reflection of local heritage, and promotion of social interaction are accurate descriptions of the award's criteria.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**2. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, instituted in 1969, commemorates the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema, and is presented annually by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was indeed instituted in 1969 to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke. While the award is presented annually, it is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs as mentioned. The Golden Lotus medallion and shawl remain part of the award. Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text states that Mithun Chakraborty received the award for 2022, not 2023.  Therefore, only statement 1 contains a substantially correct assertion, although it contains a minor inaccuracy regarding the presenting body.


**3. With reference to the Miyawaki method of afforestation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Miyawaki method, developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, involves planting diverse native tree species in close proximity to create a dense forest.
2. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in Gujarat houses one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, created using only fast-growing exotic species.
3. The method promotes rapid growth and biodiversity, but is not suitable for arid or semi-arid regions due to its high water requirement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Miyawaki method. It emphasizes the planting of a variety of native species in close proximity to accelerate growth and establish a biodiverse forest. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum does feature a large Miyawaki forest, the claim that it uses only fast-growing exotic species is inaccurate; the method prioritizes native species. Statement 3 is largely correct. The method does promote rapid growth and biodiversity; however, the assertion that it is unsuitable for arid or semi-arid regions due to high water requirements is a simplification.  While water availability is a factor, appropriate species selection and careful management can adapt the method to various climates.  Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are substantially correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Bharat Ratna Award:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, conferred by the Prime Minister upon individuals for exceptional contributions in any field.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, it is conferred by the President, not the Prime Minister.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does not include a monetary grant.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states exceptions have been made in the past, with more than three awards given in certain years. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act does indeed grant the Central Government the power to delist monuments that are no longer considered nationally significant. Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined within the AMASR Act; it is a term used by the CAG audit team. Statement 3 is incorrect. The ASI's responsibility for maintenance and conservation is contingent upon factors such as the monument's condition and accessibility; the Act does not mandate unconditional preservation in all cases.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

1. The ancient Nalanda University, established in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, was a monastic university focusing solely on Buddhist studies.
2.  The modern Nalanda University, inaugurated recently, is a "Net Zero Green Campus" located near the ruins of the ancient university.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ancient Nalanda University was a monastic university, it encompassed a wide range of subjects beyond Buddhist studies, including medicine, astronomy, and politics.  Statement 2 is correct. The new Nalanda University is indeed a "Net Zero Green Campus" located near the ancient ruins. Statement 3 is incorrect. The decision to re-establish Nalanda University was made at the *second* East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007, not the first.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, not 2015. Statement 2 is incorrect. While India proposed the resolution, it received support from 175 member states, not unanimous support from all. Statement 3 is correct. Yoga is indeed considered one of the six schools of Indian philosophy.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct; statement 1 contains a minor factual error.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Fellowship is not awarded annually; it is given to a select few writers of exceptional stature.  Statement 2 is correct. Ruskin Bond did receive the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for his contributions to English literature. Statement 3 is largely correct. While the exact comparison to a "Nobel Prize" is subjective, the Fellowship is the Sahitya Akademi's highest honor.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are substantially correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Transhumance is practiced in the Himalayas by nomadic tribes like those mentioned. Statement 2 is incorrect. The practice also exists in the plains of several Indian states. Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text mentions that two European transhumance traditions received this recognition, not any from India.  Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ratan Tata's leadership saw a dramatic expansion of the Tata Group's revenue, transforming it into a global conglomerate. This growth reflects successful diversification, strategic acquisitions, and effective management.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Tata Nano was a significant attempt to provide affordable transportation to a large segment of the Indian population. While its market impact was complex and not universally positive, its launch was a noteworthy event in the Indian automotive industry.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The PETA India award was specifically for the use of vegan interiors in the AVINYA concept car, not all Tata vehicles.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in evaluating such statements.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between specific details and broader generalizations.  The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly attribute the award to all vehicles or misrepresent the scale of the Tata group's revenue growth.

1. Swami Vivekananda's Vedanta philosophy primarily focused on the Dvaita system, emphasizing the distinction between the individual soul and Brahman.
2. His address at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago is widely considered a pivotal moment in introducing Indian spirituality to the West.
3.  Swami Vivekananda directly oversaw the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Bangalore, driven by his vision for scientific advancement in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda's philosophy encompassed aspects of various Vedanta schools, it wasn't solely focused on the Dvaita system.  His teachings drew from Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of Atman and Brahman, as well. This statement misrepresents the core tenets of his philosophy and tests the candidate's depth of understanding of Vedanta.

Statement 2 is correct. His Chicago address was indeed a landmark event, significantly raising awareness and interest in Indian spiritual thought in the West. This statement assesses the candidate's knowledge of a significant historical event in the context of cultural exchange.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Vivekananda inspired Jamsetji Tata, who later founded the IISC, Vivekananda himself did not directly oversee its establishment. This statement tests the ability to distinguish between inspiration and direct involvement.  The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly attribute the IISC's founding to Vivekananda or misrepresent his philosophical stance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) None
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister makes the recommendation to the President, the President is the final authority that confers the award.  The phrasing of the statement introduces ambiguity to test the candidate's precise understanding of the award's conferral process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does not come with any monetary grant. This is a crucial detail that often gets overlooked, making it an effective test of factual recall.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna was initially not conferred posthumously; this practice was introduced later.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the evolution of the award's regulations. The correct option is (b) because all three statements contain inaccuracies.  The question challenges the candidate's ability to identify and correct factual errors, a vital skill for analysis in the UPSC context.

Statement 2 is correct.  His donation of land was vital to the college's establishment. This tests the candidate's knowledge of philanthropy and education in colonial India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The first railway line in India ran between Bori Bunder and Thane, not Mumbai and Pune.  This is a subtle but crucial detail that serves as an effective distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge. The other options are incorrect because they either include the false statement about the railway line or omit Shankarseth's significant contributions to Bombay's urban development and education.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to identify inaccuracies and prioritize accurate information.


**5. With reference to the economic policies of the Holkar dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw the development of Maheswar and Indore as major centers of trade and commerce, while also promoting the Maheswari weaving industry.
2.  The Holkar dynasty actively resisted the integration of Bhil and Gond tribes into the mainstream economy, maintaining a strict caste-based system.
3.  The Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the complete annexation of the Holkar territories by the British East India Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign is noted for its economic prosperity and promotion of trade and crafts.  This tests the candidate's understanding of historical economic development in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar's policies aimed at social inclusion, including the mainstreaming of Bhil and Gond tribes. This statement introduces a contrasting viewpoint to test the candidate's understanding of Ahilyabai Holkar's social policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Third Anglo-Maratha War significantly impacted the Holkar dynasty, it did not lead to the complete annexation of their territories.  The Treaty of Mandsaur established a subsidiary alliance, not complete annexation.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the political outcomes of the Anglo-Maratha Wars. The correct option is (a) because only Statement 1 accurately reflects the economic policies of the Holkar dynasty under Ahilyabai Holkar's reign. The question assesses the candidate's ability to discern factual accuracy from misleading information and to integrate knowledge from different aspects of Indian history.


**1. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty and its contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, after ascending to power, established Indore as the capital of the Holkar dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar established Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh as the seat of the Holkar dynasty, not Indore.  Indore's growth as a major trade and commercial center happened under her rule, but it wasn't the initial capital.  Statement 2 is correct. The Holkar Dynasty was indeed part of the Maratha Confederacy, sharing power with other significant Maratha houses like the Bhonsle of Nagpur and the Gaekwad of Baroda. This demonstrates the decentralized nature of Maratha power.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Ahilyabai Holkar actively promoted the Maheswari weaving industry in Maheshwar, contributing significantly to its economic prosperity. The fact that Maheswar “Sarees & Fabric” is registered as a Geographical Indication (GI) product is a testament to this legacy. The question highlights the significance of understanding the nuances of historical events and the accurate association of individuals with specific actions and locations.  Distractors are included to test a candidate's in-depth knowledge rather than superficial understanding.


**2. With reference to the UNESCO recognitions mentioned, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the UNESCO Prix Versailles award in 2022 for its architectural design.
2. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in Bhuj, Gujarat, features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kempegowda International Airport did receive the UNESCO Prix Versailles award, it was in 2023, not 2022. This subtle change in the year serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of facts. Statement 2 is correct. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum prominently features a large Miyawaki forest, showcasing sustainable environmental practices.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register did include manuscripts of Indian literary works, the specific texts mentioned were the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, not the Ramayana and Mahabharata.  This highlights the importance of precise knowledge of the specific details associated with these recognitions.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to distinguish between accurate and slightly altered information, a critical skill for analyzing information objectively.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its administration, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Ayagar system, comprising twelve functionaries, was appointed by the government in each village and was a non-hereditary system, regularly reviewed for efficiency.
3.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the empire's expansion to include the Raichur doab, subjugation of Orissa, and significant victories against the Sultan of Bijapur, marking the empire's zenith under the Tuluva Dynasty.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Amara-Nayakas were powerful regional governors under the Vijayanagara empire, given significant autonomy in their assigned territories. They collected taxes and retained a share for their expenses, including maintaining their military and infrastructure. This system reflects the decentralized nature of Vijayanagara administration. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ayagar system, while appointed by the government, became hereditary over time. This crucial detail is often overlooked, showcasing the need for precise historical knowledge.  Statement 3 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is widely considered the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire, characterized by significant territorial expansion and military victories. His conquests, as mentioned in the statement, solidified the empire's position as a dominant power in South India. The question tests not only factual knowledge but also the ability to discern subtle inaccuracies in descriptions of administrative systems and historical events.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization's trade networks extended to Mesopotamia, with evidence found in Mesopotamian records referring to the Indus region as Meluha and mentioning intermediate trading stations like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast).
2.  The Harappan script, while pictographic, has been fully deciphered, revealing significant details about their religious beliefs and social structures.
3.  The religion of the Indus Valley Civilization exclusively focused on the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), as depicted in seals, with no evidence of female deities or nature worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indus Valley Civilization had extensive trade connections with Mesopotamia, as evidenced by archaeological finds and textual references. The names Meluha, Dilmun, and Makan in Mesopotamian records point to the existence of established trade routes and interactions. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Harappan script remains undeciphered, a significant challenge for archaeologists and historians trying to understand the civilization's culture and society.  The lack of decipherment limits our knowledge of their religious beliefs and social structures. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Pasupati (proto-Shiva) was an important deity, the Indus Valley Civilization also worshipped a Mother Goddess, as evidenced by terracotta figurines. Nature worship was also prevalent, indicating a more complex religious system than a focus solely on a male deity. The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the limitations of current knowledge regarding the Indus Valley Civilization and the need to avoid making assumptions based on incomplete data.


**5. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Dynasty, founded by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince from Mong Mao, was characterized by a highly centralized monarchy with absolute power vested in the king.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom kings held considerable power, the administration was not strictly centralized. The Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris) played a significant role in governance. Statement 2 is correct. The Ahom political system was a unique blend of monarchy and oligarchy. The Council of Ministers held substantial influence, and their consent was crucial for the appointment of a new king. This demonstrates a balance of power within the administration. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ahom Dynasty adopted and patronized both Shaivism and the Shakti movement, alongside building numerous temples dedicated to these faiths, including the Kamakhya Devi Temple.  The question highlights the complexity of historical political systems and the need for careful consideration of the interplay between different power structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

Statement 1 is accurate. Vivekananda's speech at the Parliament of Religions was indeed a landmark event, significantly impacting the perception of Hinduism and Indian spirituality in the West. His eloquent articulation of Vedanta philosophy captivated audiences and fostered a global interest in Indian thought.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ramakrishna Mission was indeed established in 1897, its activities went far beyond spiritual practices and monastic life.  The Mission actively engages in extensive social service, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges, reflecting Vivekananda's emphasis on practical application of spiritual principles for societal betterment.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the Mission's work.

Statement 3 is correct. Historical accounts strongly suggest that Vivekananda's influence played a crucial role in inspiring Tata's vision for the IISC.  Their meeting in 1893 is seen as a significant turning point in the development of scientific education in India. Vivekananda's emphasis on the importance of scientific temper and modern education resonated with Tata's own aspirations for India's progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was a significant ruler known for her administrative capabilities and patronage of arts and culture,  the statement incorrectly attributes radical land reforms to her immediately upon ascension.  Her rule focused more on temple reconstruction, infrastructure development, and promoting trade and commerce. The claim of immediate implementation of modern taxation methods is historically unsupported.

Statement 2 is correct. The Holkar Dynasty was indeed a key member of the Maratha Confederacy, a powerful political alliance that played a crucial role in 18th-century Indian politics. The statement accurately lists other major players within the Confederacy.

Statement 3 is correct. The Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the defeat of the Holkar forces under Malhar Rao Holkar II, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur. This treaty fundamentally reshaped the relationship between the Holkars and the British, marking a shift in power dynamics and setting the stage for future interactions under British influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  There's no historical evidence to suggest Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's involvement in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.  His actions and affiliations were largely focused on philanthropy and urban development rather than active rebellion against the British.

Statement 2 is correct.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions to Mumbai's urban landscape are well-documented. He played a key role in shaping the city's physical structure through his involvement in planning and development projects.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While it is true that he contributed to boys' education,  his philanthropy extended significantly to girls' education as well, which was a less common practice at the time.  The statement misrepresents the scope of his philanthropic activities by omitting his crucial contributions to girls' education, thus presenting an incomplete picture of his legacy.


**4. With reference to the Arya Samaj and Swami Dayanand Saraswati, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy emphasized a strict adherence to ritualistic practices and idol worship, rejecting any form of reform within the Vedic tradition.
2.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, introduced proselytization as a key aspect of its mission, actively seeking to convert people to Hinduism.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy was precisely the opposite – he vehemently opposed idol worship and ritualistic practices, advocating for a return to the original principles of the Vedas, emphasizing a simpler, more rational approach to religious practice.  The statement directly contradicts his core beliefs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arya Samaj, under Dayanand Saraswati's leadership, was indeed one of the first Hindu organizations to actively engage in proselytization, seeking to spread its interpretation of Vedic principles and bring others into the fold of Hinduism.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While a split did occur in 1892, the primary reasons were not solely about the promotion of Sanskrit. The division stemmed from broader disagreements regarding the interpretation of Vedic teachings, the style of religious instruction, and even dietary practices.  The statement oversimplifies the complex reasons behind the split by focusing on a single, less significant factor.


**5. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

2.  The award, initially not conferred posthumously, was later amended to allow posthumous conferment, reflecting a change in policy.
3.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna are permitted to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their names, showcasing their prestigious achievement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President confers the award, there is no formal selection committee. The Prime Minister makes the recommendations to the President;  there is no formal process or committee involved. The statement misrepresents the process of selection.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Bharat Ratna was initially only awarded to living individuals, but the rules were later amended to allow posthumous awards, reflecting a change in government policy to recognize individuals even after their deaths.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution explicitly prohibits the use of the Bharat Ratna title as a prefix or suffix to one's name. While recipients can mention their receipt of the award in their biodata or other formal documents,  they are not allowed to use it as a title.  The statement contradicts the constitutional provision.


**6. With reference to Ratan Tata's contributions and legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue experienced a significant decline, primarily due to diversification into loss-making ventures.
2.  Tata Motors, under Ratan Tata's leadership, launched the Tata Nano, a car designed to be affordable for the Indian masses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group experienced a dramatic *increase* in revenue, not a decline.  His leadership transformed the group into a global conglomerate.  The statement presents a directly opposite claim to the reality.

Statement 2 is correct. The Tata Nano was indeed launched under Ratan Tata's tenure, representing a significant attempt to provide affordable transportation to a large segment of the Indian population.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ratan Tata did receive the Padma Vibhushan, the year is mentioned incorrectly. He received it in 2008, not 2010.  The statement contains a minor but crucial factual error regarding the year of the award.


**1. With reference to the Arya Samaj and its principles, consider the following statements:**

1. Arya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to actively promote proselytization, aiming to convert individuals to Hinduism.
2.  The Arya Samaj's philosophy, rooted in universalism, emphasized the rejection of all rituals and superstitions, promoting education for all and women's rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Arya Samaj, under Dayanand Saraswati's leadership, was indeed a pioneering Hindu organization in actively promoting proselytization, a practice not traditionally emphasized in Hinduism.  This was a radical departure from established norms and aimed to expand the Hindu faith.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Arya Samaj strongly opposed what it considered meaningless rituals and superstitions, and advocated for education and women's rights, the statement's claim of a complete rejection of *all* rituals is an oversimplification.  The movement's reformist approach involved selective rejection of practices deemed incompatible with its interpretation of Vedic principles.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1892 schism within the Arya Samaj was a significant event stemming from fundamental disagreements. The conservative Gurukul wing, led by Swami Shraddhanand, favored a more traditional approach, while the radical college group, under Lala Hansraj, advocated for a more modern and inclusive interpretation, leading to disputes over language and dietary norms.  The core of the disagreement was not just about language but also about the interpretation of Vedic scriptures and their relevance to contemporary life.  Different interpretations led to differing views on appropriate practices.


**2. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's life and contributions, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's Chicago address was a landmark event, effectively introducing Vedanta philosophy to a global audience. His eloquent articulation of Hindu thought resonated widely, shaping perceptions of Indian spirituality in the West. The establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 formalized his efforts to translate spiritual ideals into practical social service.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Vivekananda's birth anniversary is indeed celebrated as National Youth Day, and he was deeply influenced by Advaita Vedanta, to say he *exclusively* emphasized this system is inaccurate.  His understanding of Vedanta was broader, incorporating elements of Visistadvaita and Dvaita systems, demonstrating a nuanced approach to the philosophical tradition.

Statement 3 is correct.  Vivekananda's influence extended beyond religious discourse; his interactions with Jamsetji Tata played a crucial role in inspiring the latter's vision for the IISC, fostering scientific advancement in India.  This interaction highlights the multifaceted nature of Vivekananda's influence on Indian society and its development.

(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's rise to power followed the deaths of her husband and father-in-law. Her reign is celebrated for its focus on temple reconstruction, particularly her significant contributions to the Kashi Vishvanath and Somnath temples, showcasing her devotion and commitment to religious heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Ahilyabai's father was Mankoji Rao Shinde, not Malhar Rao Holkar.  Malhar Rao Holkar was her father-in-law, and he was indeed a significant figure in the Maratha Empire, serving under Peshwa Baji Rao I and responsible for collecting Chouth and Sardeshmukhi in Malwa.  This confusion between father and father-in-law is a common misconception.

Statement 3 is correct. Ahilyabai's patronage extended beyond religious endeavors; she actively supported scholars and artists, including the prominent Marathi poet Moropant and the Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram, demonstrating her commitment to cultural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is indeed dedicated to Lord Shiva and its unique location at the confluence of rivers makes it vulnerable to annual submersion due to the Srisailam dam's backwaters. This unusual characteristic adds to its significance.

Statement 2 is correct.  Historical accounts attribute the construction of this specific Sangameshwar Temple to the Chalukya dynasty.  Its location at the confluence of Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, along with five other tributaries, is the reason for its name, Sangameswara, signifying the convergence of sacred waters.

Statement 3 is correct. The widespread reverence for Lord Shiva is evident in the existence of multiple Sangameshwar Temples across India.  The mentioned locations in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka (as part of the Pattadakal UNESCO World Heritage Site) demonstrate the deity's regional significance and the temple's architectural variations across different regions.  The existence of multiple temples with the same name indicates the widespread popularity of the deity and the importance of the confluence of rivers in the location of these temples.

The script of the Indus Valley Civilization remains undeciphered to this day, posing a significant challenge for historians. Statement 3 is incorrect. While evidence suggests the worship of a Mother Goddess and a possible proto-Shiva figure (Pasupati), the specific deities Vishnu and Shiva, as they are known in later Hindu traditions, were not the primary deities of the Indus Valley Civilization.

**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments in India, consider the following statements:**

2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" and outlines a specific procedure for handling such cases.
3.  The delisting of a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, automatically leads to its removal from all official records and databases maintained by the ASI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is indeed based on a Ministry of Culture report assessing national importance and traceability.  This process is crucial for managing the vast number of monuments under ASI's purview and prioritizing resources for those deemed nationally significant.  The assessment considers factors like historical significance, architectural merit, and the feasibility of preservation efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* explicitly define "Missing Monuments." This term emerged from CAG audit reports and represents a practical challenge in monument management rather than a formal legal category within the Act itself. The Act focuses on declaring monuments of national importance or determining if they have ceased to be so.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act removes ASI's direct responsibility for conservation, protection, and maintenance, it doesn't automatically erase the monument from all official records.  The monument might still be documented in historical records, research databases, or other archives.  The delisting primarily concerns the ongoing responsibilities of the ASI, not the historical existence of the monument.

1. The establishment of the new Nalanda University campus was primarily driven by a resolution passed during the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the idea of reviving Nalanda University gained momentum through discussions at East Asia Summits, the provided text states that the decision to establish it was made at the *2nd* EAS in 2007, not the first. The 2nd EAS provided the basis for the establishment, not the 1st.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ancient Nalanda University's curriculum, though heavily influenced by Buddhism, was far more diverse. It encompassed a wide range of subjects including Vedas, Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and even war strategy.  The statement significantly underrepresents the scope of the ancient university's academic pursuits.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The modern Nalanda University, while receiving significant funding from the Government of India, actively seeks and receives international collaborations and funding to support its research and educational initiatives.  The statement incorrectly portrays it as being solely dependent on Indian government funding.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Padma Awards recognize achievements in arts and culture, they are not limited to this field. They are given across a wide range of disciplines including medicine, literature, education, sports, and social work.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the awards.

Statement 2 is correct. The description accurately reflects the hierarchical structure of the Padma Awards.  Padma Vibhushan is indeed for exceptional and distinguished service, representing a higher level of achievement than the Padma Shri, which recognizes distinguished service of a high order.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Padma Awards are typically not conferred posthumously, the text explicitly states that the government *can* consider awarding them posthumously in highly deserving cases.  The statement's absolute prohibition is inaccurate.


**4. With reference to the Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The new Lady Justice statue *removes* the blindfold, signifying that justice is not blind but sees and understands societal complexities. The removal of the blindfold is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the British, not the French, introduced the Lady Justice statue to India, beginning with the Calcutta High Court in 1872.  The statement misattributes the origin of the statue's introduction to India.

Statement 3 is correct. The new statue indeed replaces the traditional sword with the Indian Constitution. This symbolic change represents the constitutional basis of justice in India, emphasizing the Constitution's supremacy over other considerations in judicial proceedings.  This is a key element of the statue's decolonial and contemporary interpretation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that Nalanda was destroyed in 1205 AD, not 1105 AD, by Bakhtiyar Khalji under Qutbuddin Aibak, not Muhammad Ghori. The statement contains errors in both the date and the ruler's name associated with the destruction.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes the legendary library of Nalanda University, the "Dharma Gunj," as containing over nine million books across nine floors.  This reflects the scale and significance of the library's collection.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Aryabhata is associated with Nalanda, the text does not definitively state that he spent his *entire* career teaching there.  The statement presents a stronger claim than the source material supports.  The text mentions Aryabhata as having studied and taught at Nalanda, but not necessarily his entire career.

However, there is no information about a specific Indian Transhumance tradition receiving recognition in 2023.  Statement 3 is correct.  The description of the Himalayan nomadic tribes and their seasonal migration patterns accurately reflects the Transhumance practice. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the geographical scope of Transhumance in India and the UNESCO recognition of Transhumance traditions.

They were responsible for local administration and maintenance of infrastructure.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Krishnadevaraya expanded the empire by acquiring the Raichur Doab and subjugating Orissa, he also engaged in significant conflicts with the Sultan of Bijapur.  Statement 3 is correct. The mentioned temples are indeed prominent examples of Vijayanagara architecture, and the Hampi complex is rightly recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate, however, option (d) is the best option as it contains the most correct statements.

(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangama dynasty founded the Vijayanagara Empire, followed by the Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties.  The chronological order is crucial here, and reversing it represents a common misconception.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign was a high point for the empire, marked by significant territorial expansion and military victories.  The acquisition of the Raichur Doab and conflicts with Orissa and Bijapur are well-documented historical events.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Amara-Nayakas did manage territories, their primary role was as military commanders who were granted lands in return for military service. Revenue collection was a part of their responsibility, but it wasn't their sole function.  Confusing their military and administrative roles is a common pitfall.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Rajendra I's ambitious naval expeditions, which significantly expanded Chola influence across Southeast Asia. The conquest of parts of the Sailendra Empire in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra is a well-established fact in Chola history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did strengthen the Chola navy, his naval campaigns were not limited to internal trade routes. He also engaged in significant overseas expeditions, expanding Chola power and influence beyond the Coromandel Coast.  Restricting his naval activities to internal trade routes misrepresents the scope of his achievements.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the annexation of the entire island, not just the southern part. This complete control is a key aspect of his military success and expansion of the Chola Empire's territorial reach.


**3. With reference to the practice of Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is correct. Yusuf Dadoo was a prominent figure in South African anti-apartheid activism, playing a significant role in organizations like the Non-European United Front and the Communist Party.  His contribution is often underrepresented in discussions of the movement.

Statement 3 is partially correct but oversimplifies India's role. While financial aid was part of it, India's support also included diplomatic efforts at the UN, severing trade relations with the apartheid regime, and providing a platform for ANC activities.  Focusing solely on financial aid ignores the broader dimensions of India's support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the question mentions three Indian literary works, the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes works from other countries in the region as well. The inclusion of Indian works highlights the richness of India's literary heritage but doesn't make it exclusive to Indian works. This tests the understanding of the international scope of the MOW programme.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ramcharitmanas was written in the 16th century, not the 17th century.  This subtle chronological error serves as a crucial distractor, emphasizing the need for precise factual accuracy.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the specific details regarding the literary works included in the register.

Statement 3 is correct. The MOW Programme was indeed launched in 1992 and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. This highlights the hierarchical structure of the program and its global reach in preserving documentary heritage.  The statement tests knowledge of the organisational structure and objectives of the MOW Programme.

1. The 2026 CWG in Glasgow will feature all the sports that were part of the 2022 edition.
2. Badminton and Wrestling were among the sports dropped from the 2026 CWG.
3. India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010 in Mumbai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 2026 CWG in Glasgow significantly reduced the number of sports compared to the 2022 edition.  This highlights the evolving nature of the Games and the decisions involved in selecting sports.  The question tests the candidate's awareness of recent changes in the CWG format.

Statement 2 is correct.  Badminton and wrestling were among the six sports dropped from the 2026 CWG, impacting India's medal prospects.  This requires knowledge of specific sporting events and their implications for participating nations. The statement tests detailed knowledge about the composition of recent CWG editions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010 in Delhi, not Mumbai.  This seemingly minor geographical error acts as a significant distractor, emphasizing the importance of precise location details.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the host cities of previous Commonwealth Games.


**4. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC is being developed under the "Sagarmala" Programme by the Ministry of Tourism.
2. Lothal is significant for its discovery of an ancient man-made dry dock, dating back to approximately 2400 BC.
3. The NMHC's primary aim is to showcase India's maritime heritage from only the medieval period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, but it's under the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, not the Ministry of Tourism.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the governmental agencies involved in the project.  The subtle difference in the ministry highlights the need for precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. Lothal's significance stems from its well-preserved ancient man-made dry dock, providing valuable insights into India's early maritime technology. This requires knowledge of the archaeological discoveries at Lothal and their historical importance.  The statement tests the candidate's knowledge of specific archaeological sites and their relevance to India's maritime history.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMHC aims to showcase India's rich maritime heritage across various periods, from ancient times to the present, not just the medieval period.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the NMHC's scope and objectives. The broad timeframe of the project's aim is contrasted with a limited timeframe, creating a distractor.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire encompassed regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, establishing significant Chola influence in Southeast Asia.
3. The Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal primarily facilitated trade with West Asian countries, while trade with Southeast Asia remained limited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects Rajendra I's extensive naval conquests, extending Chola power and influence significantly into Southeast Asia.  His campaigns reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, leaving a lasting impact on the region's political landscape and demonstrating the reach and power of the Chola navy.  The Chola's "Look East Policy" was crucial for establishing and maintaining these far-reaching trade connections.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I was a powerful naval commander, his major naval victory was against the Chera navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai.  Confusing the Pandya and Chera kingdoms is a common error, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of South Indian history.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chola navy's control over the Bay of Bengal was indeed instrumental in facilitating extensive trade, but this trade network encompassed both Southeast Asia and West Asia. The statement's assertion that Southeast Asian trade was limited is factually inaccurate.  The Chola's maritime prowess was crucial for their economic prosperity through trade links with both regions. The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related South Indian kingdoms and their interactions with the Chola empire.


**2. With reference to the International Cricket Council (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICC, headquartered in Dubai, UAE, is responsible for organizing the T20 World Cup, the Champions Trophy, and the World Test Championship.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ICC, headquartered in Dubai, indeed organizes and governs major international cricket tournaments, including the ones mentioned.  This is a well-known fact, but the question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific tournaments under ICC's umbrella.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ICC was not established in 1909. While the exact date of its formal establishment might vary depending on how one defines the organization's origins, it is significantly later than 1909. The statement aims to mislead by providing a plausible but incorrect date, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the ICC's timeline.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the ICC sets the rules and regulations for international cricket, it does not directly manage or control the individual national cricket boards.  Each national board retains autonomy over its domestic cricket affairs. The statement highlights the distinction between international governance and national cricket administration.  The question tests the understanding of the ICC's role within the global cricket structure.

3. The Olympic flag, featuring five interlocking rings, was first introduced at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was indeed established in 1983 to resolve legal disputes within the world of sports, including the Olympic Games. Its establishment was a significant development in addressing the legal complexities of international sporting events.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896, the motto "Faster, Higher, Stronger" was not adopted then. Its adoption came later. This error serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the Olympic history.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Olympic flag was not introduced in 1912.  The date is incorrect. This again tests the candidate's memory of specific details surrounding the Olympic Games. The question assesses recall of key facts related to the Olympic Games and its governance.  The inclusion of incorrect dates and details increases the difficulty level.


**4. With reference to the National Film Awards of India, consider the following statements:**

2. The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since their inception in 1954.
3.  The awards include categories for Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema, and also recognize the "Most Film-Friendly State."

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The National Film Awards indeed encompass categories for feature and non-feature films, best writing on cinema, and the "Most Film-Friendly State" award.  This is a factual statement testing the candidate's knowledge of the award's scope.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1964, and did not initially focus solely on feature films.  The statement plays on the candidate's general awareness of the awards, trying to create confusion with an inaccurate establishment date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Directorate of Film Festivals currently administers the awards, this was not the case from the very beginning. The statement tests the candidate's awareness of the award's administrative history.  The question tests the recall of specific details about the National Film Awards and their administration.  The inclusion of incorrect dates and details makes it a challenging question for an examinee.

1.  Transhumance is a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement involving the migration of human communities with their herds, primarily prevalent in the Himalayan regions of India.
2. In 2023, two transhumance traditions – Transhumance in 10 European States and Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland – were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.
3.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses exclusively on preserving transhumance traditions in the Himalayas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 and 2 are correct. Transhumance is indeed a traditional practice of seasonal livestock migration, involving human communities moving with their herds.  This practice is widespread, including in the Himalayas.  The UNESCO recognition of two transhumance traditions in 2023 further highlights the global importance of this cultural practice.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, has a broader scope than just the Himalayas.  It aims to preserve and promote transhumance traditions globally, not limiting its focus to a specific region.  The statement creates a distractor by limiting the initiative's scope.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of transhumance as a practice and its global recognition.  The inclusion of a geographically limited statement adds to the difficulty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chola Empire was renowned for its powerful navy, which played a crucial role in their expansion and control over maritime trade routes in the Bay of Bengal.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I are both known for their aggressive naval policies.  Their naval prowess allowed them to establish dominance over the Bay of Bengal, transforming it into a "Chola lake."

Statement 3 is correct. Nagapattinam was a major port city and a pivotal trading center for the Chola Empire. Its strategic location facilitated extensive trade with countries in Southeast Asia. This trade was instrumental in the Chola Empire's economic prosperity and cultural exchange. The "Look East Policy" of the Cholas is directly linked to this extensive maritime trade.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are *semi*-subterranean, meaning they are partially underground, not entirely.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While megalithic burial practices have origins in the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, their use continued into the Iron Age. The presence of iron artifacts is often associated with megalithic sites, indicating their usage spanned across these periods.  Statement 3 is correct.  The provided text clearly categorizes megaliths into these three types based on their structure and association with burial practices. The classification encompasses the range of variations observed in megalithic architecture across different regions and time periods.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bavikonda Monastery dates back to the 3rd century BCE, not the 2nd century CE, and it's a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, not Mahayana.  Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states Salihundam's role in spreading Buddhism eastward. Statement 3 is correct.  The archaeological finds at Phanigiri indicate the simultaneous presence of both Mahayana and Hinayana traditions during the 2nd-3rd centuries CE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built during the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela for Jain monks, not Vaishnavite monks during the Gupta period.  The text clearly attributes the construction to the Meghavahana dynasty and Jain patronage. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sangameswar Temple is indeed located at a river confluence, it's the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with five other tributaries, not the Krishna and Tungabhadra. Statement 3 is correct. The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is a distinct blend of Upper Burmese, Pala, and later Ahom styles, reflecting the region's diverse cultural influences and historical evolution. The text specifically highlights this mixed architectural heritage.


**4. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty and their cultural practices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings ruled with absolute power, unconstrained by any council or ministerial body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ahom administration, while a monarchy, significantly involved the Council of Ministry (Patra Mantris). The king's appointment required their concurrence, highlighting a system of checks and balances. Statement 2 is partially correct. Moidams do indeed include the octagonal wall and grave goods. However, the text mentions servants for the afterlife, not human sacrifices.  Statement 3 is correct. The Me-Dam-Me-Phi ritual is explicitly mentioned as a continuous practice linking the present to the Ahom era.  This demonstrates the cultural endurance of Ahom traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harappan script remains undeciphered, limiting our understanding of their writing system and its contents.  Statement 2 is correct. Lothal's significance as a maritime center with a sophisticated dockyard is well-established archaeologically. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Pasupati was a prominent deity, the Harappans also revered the Mother Goddess and practiced nature worship.  The text mentions both male and female deities, along with evidence of nature worship.  The statement oversimplifies the complexity of Harappan religious beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are semi-subterranean, meaning they are partially underground, not fully subterranean.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Megalithic burial practices encompassed chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and even structures not directly associated with burials.  Statement 3 is incorrect because while many megaliths are associated with burials, some served other purposes, demonstrating the diversity of megalithic traditions.  The text explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths, demonstrating the diversity and not the singular purpose of burial.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Akalis of Punjab did offer support to the Satyagrahis,  it's inaccurate to state they were the *sole* providers of financial assistance.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Paris 2024 Games were a significant performance, it's inaccurate to claim it as India's best ever. India's performance in other games might have had a higher medal count or more gold medals.  The statement overstates the significance of the recent games.

Statement 2 is correct. Norman Pritchard's participation in the 1900 Paris Olympics is a well-documented fact, representing India's first Olympic appearance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the IOA was formed in 1927, its recognition by the IOC happened in the same year, but the question implies an immediate recognition, which might not be entirely accurate considering the bureaucratic processes involved.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kasturi Cotton uses blockchain for traceability and is a premium brand, it's inaccurate to state it's produced exclusively by government-owned ginning facilities.  The initiative empowers *all* ginners in India to participate in the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.  The statement creates a false impression of limited participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  The statement diminishes the involvement of other key stakeholders.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI intends to delist *some* centrally protected monuments deemed "untraceable," not all of them.  The statement exaggerates the scale of the delisting process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Delisting under the AMASR Act, 1958, does not automatically lead to the destruction or removal of monuments. It simply means that the ASI will no longer provide conservation, protection, and maintenance.  The statement creates a false impression of immediate destruction.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The term "missing monuments" is not officially recognized within the AMASR Act, 1958. It was a term used by the CAG Audit team in their report.  The statement introduces a non-official term as if it were part of the legal framework.



**1. With reference to Megalithic sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic monument, are characterized by being chamber tombs that are partially subterranean.
2.  The three basic types of megaliths are chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths unconnected with burials.
3.  Megalithic cultures in India practiced a fully nomadic lifestyle, never settling in one defined area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of megalithic burial structure that are partially underground or semi-subterranean.  These structures are found across various regions of India and represent a significant aspect of the megalithic culture's burial practices. The semi-subterranean nature of these structures offers insights into their construction techniques and the beliefs associated with burial rituals.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The classification of megaliths into chamber tombs (those with enclosed burial chambers), unchambered tombs (simpler, often pit-like burials), and megaliths without any apparent burial association is a widely accepted archaeological categorization. This classification helps in understanding the diversity of burial practices and the evolution of megalithic traditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Megalithic cultures were not exclusively nomadic. While some groups might have practiced seasonal mobility (transhumance), many megalithic sites show evidence of settled or semi-settled lifestyles. The construction of elaborate burial structures, often requiring significant labor and resources, suggests a degree of social organization and resource control inconsistent with a purely nomadic existence. The presence of associated settlements near megalithic sites further supports this observation.  The creation of permanent or semi-permanent structures for dwelling and agriculture indicates a degree of settlement and not complete nomadism.


**2. With reference to the Phanigiri archaeological site, consider the following statements:**

1. Phanigiri, located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad, is predominantly known for its significant Jain monuments.
2. Excavations at Phanigiri have unearthed a coin hoard belonging to the Ikshvaku period, along with structures like a Mahastupa and Chaitya Grihas.
3. The architectural elements at Phanigiri demonstrate the exclusive dominance of the Mahayana sect of Buddhism during that period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Phanigiri is an important archaeological site, it is primarily known for its Buddhist, not Jain, remains.  The site contains significant Buddhist structures and artifacts dating back to the Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods. The presence of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas (prayer halls), and viharas (monasteries) clearly indicates a strong Buddhist association.  There is no significant evidence of Jain monuments at this location.

Statement 2 is correct.  Archaeological excavations at Phanigiri have indeed unearthed a coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period. This discovery provides valuable insights into the economic and political context of the region during that time.  The presence of a Mahastupa and Chaitya Grihas further underscores the site's significance as a major Buddhist center.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The architectural features of Phanigiri indicate the co-existence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects. The presence of various types of structures and iconography suggests that the site was not exclusively associated with one particular sect. The coexistence of these sects reflects the religious diversity of the region during that historical period.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. Located near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, Bavikonda Monastery is a significant example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture.
2. The name "Bavikonda" translates to "hill of wells," reflecting the site's historical use of rainwater harvesting systems.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bavikonda Monastery is a significant example of Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana Buddhism. Its architectural features and the discovered artifacts align more closely with Theravada Buddhist traditions prevalent during that period.  The presence of a Mahastupa, Acharya Vihara, and Chaitya Griha are characteristic of Theravada Buddhist monastic complexes.

Statement 2 is correct. The name "Bavikonda," meaning "hill of wells," accurately describes the site's historical characteristic. The presence of numerous wells indicates the importance of water management and rainwater harvesting in the region. This is a crucial aspect of understanding the site's location, its sustainability, and the daily life of the monastic community.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Bavikonda Monastery dates back to the 3rd century BCE, not the 1st century CE.  This earlier dating places the monastery within a crucial period of early Buddhism in the region. The significant age of the monastery suggests the longevity of Buddhist traditions in the area and its importance as a center of religious and cultural activity.


**4. With reference to the Chola naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions primarily focused on land conquests within the Indian subcontinent.

3. The Chola naval expeditions extended as far as the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrating their extensive maritime reach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja Chola I's reign saw significant naval activity, his expeditions were not limited to land conquests within India. His naval power was instrumental in extending Chola influence beyond the subcontinent.  His naval victories included significant maritime engagements and the establishment of Chola power in maritime regions.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's reign saw a successful Chola naval campaign against Sri Lanka, leading to the island becoming a Chola province. This conquest demonstrates the Chola navy's prowess and its ability to project power across significant maritime distances. The annexation of Sri Lanka was a landmark achievement in Chola imperial expansion.

Statement 3 is correct. The Chola naval expeditions reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, indicating a vast maritime empire and advanced naval capabilities.  These far-reaching expeditions showcase the extent of Chola maritime power and their influence in Southeast Asia. The Chola navy's reach is a testament to their sophisticated shipbuilding, navigation, and logistical skills.


**5. With reference to Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a modern practice of livestock movement, primarily adopted in response to changing climatic conditions.
2.  In India, transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region by nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis.
3.  The transhumance system involves moving livestock to subalpine and alpine pastures during summer and to adjoining plains during winter.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance is not a modern practice; it is a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement that has been followed for centuries. It is an ancient adaptation to environmental conditions, enabling pastoral communities to utilize diverse grazing resources throughout the year. While climate change may impact the practice, its origins are deeply rooted in traditional pastoralism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayan region of India, where nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes such as Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas practice this traditional form of pastoralism.  These communities have adapted their lifestyles to the seasonal variations in the Himalayan environment, ensuring the survival of their livestock and their own livelihoods.

Statement 3 is correct. The core of the transhumance system is the seasonal movement of livestock between different grazing areas.  During the summer months, livestock is moved to higher-altitude pastures (subalpine and alpine), which offer lush vegetation.  During the winter, they are moved to lower-altitude areas (adjoining plains) where they can find sustenance despite snow cover and lower temperatures.  This seasonal movement is crucial for the health and productivity of the livestock.


**6. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW programme was launched in 1992 with the primary aim of promoting digital preservation of cultural heritage.
2.  The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3. The MoW programme maintains only an International Register, focusing on globally significant documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Memory of the World (MoW) programme was indeed launched in 1992, but its primary aim is not limited to digital preservation.  While digital preservation is a component, the broader goal is to preserve the world's documentary heritage in all its forms, including physical documents and other media.  The program aims to ensure the long-term survival and accessibility of significant documentary materials.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are indeed among the Indian literary works that have been included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This inclusion recognizes the significant cultural and historical value of these works, ensuring their preservation for future generations.  Their selection highlights the rich literary heritage of India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MoW programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  This multi-tiered approach allows for the recognition and preservation of documentary heritage at different levels—international, regional, and national—depending on the significance and scope of the materials.  The existence of multiple registers reflects a comprehensive strategy for preserving documentary heritage.

2. Kharavela, a significant ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is known for his patronage of Jainism and the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.
3. The Hathigumpha inscription, located in the Udayagiri caves, is written in the Prakrit script and details the military campaigns of Kharavela.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, while a significant event, did not result in the complete annihilation of the Kalinga kingdom.  Although the Mauryan Empire conquered Kalinga, the kingdom did not cease to exist entirely.  Kalinga continued to exist as a political entity, albeit under Mauryan rule, and its culture and identity persisted.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela, a prominent ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is well-known for his patronage of Jainism.  He oversaw the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, which are significant examples of rock-cut architecture and contain numerous Jain sculptures and inscriptions.  His patronage demonstrates the cultural flourishing of Jainism during his reign.

Statement 3 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription, located in the Udayagiri caves, is a significant historical record. While the statement mentions the Prakrit script, it is more precisely written in Brahmi script. This inscription details the military campaigns and achievements of King Kharavela, providing valuable insights into his reign and the political context of the time.  Its existence is a testament to the sophisticated writing system and record-keeping practices of the period.


**8. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1. Located in Bhuj, Gujarat, the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum commemorates the victims of the 1993 Latur earthquake.

3. The Smritivan museum features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, showcasing rapid forest regeneration techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, not the 1993 Latur earthquake.  The 2001 earthquake, with its epicenter in Bhuj, caused widespread devastation, and the museum serves as a poignant reminder of this tragic event and the resilience of the people affected.

Statement 2 is correct. The museum's location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill is accurate. This hill also houses the historic Bhujio Fort, built by Rao Godji in 1723.  The proximity of the museum to the fort adds another layer of historical significance to the location.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Smritivan museum indeed boasts one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests. This initiative demonstrates a commitment to environmental sustainability and showcases the rapid forest regeneration potential of the Miyawaki method.  The presence of such a large Miyawaki forest is a unique feature of the museum.

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha was a movement focused on securing temple entry for Dalits in the princely state of Travancore.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi played a direct and prominent role in leading the Vaikom Satyagraha from its inception.
3. E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was a key figure in mobilizing support for the Vaikom Satyagraha, and was among those arrested and imprisoned during the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant non-violent movement aimed at securing temple entry for lower-caste Hindus ("lower caste" is an outdated term, but used here for historical accuracy), specifically those from the Ezhava community, who faced exclusion from the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple in Travancore (present-day Kerala). This movement challenged the deeply entrenched caste system and its discriminatory practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement and offered his moral backing, he did not directly lead the Vaikom Satyagraha from its inception.  The leadership of the Satyagraha was primarily undertaken by local leaders and activists such as T.K. Madhavan and George Joseph.  Gandhi's support was crucial in raising the profile of the movement, but his direct involvement in the day-to-day operations was limited.

Statement 3 is correct. E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a vital role in mobilizing support for the Vaikom Satyagraha, using his powerful oratory skills to galvanize public opinion and garner support for the cause. He was arrested during the movement, however, he did not receive rigorous imprisonment.  His participation highlights the movement's broader social and political significance.  His involvement demonstrates the intersection of caste-based discrimination and broader social justice struggles of the period.


**10. With reference to prehistoric rock art in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest rock paintings in India are associated with the Mesolithic period, characterized by vivid depictions of human activities and hunting scenes.
2.  Rock paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period in India primarily feature linear representations of animals, using green and dark red pigments.
3.  Rock paintings from the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period show a decline in artistic detail and vibrancy, with a preference for white and red pigments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The earliest rock paintings in India are associated with the Upper Paleolithic period, not the Mesolithic period. While Mesolithic paintings also exist and depict human activities, the earliest examples date back to the Upper Paleolithic era.  The Upper Paleolithic paintings are characterized by simpler styles and limited color palettes compared to later periods.

Statement 2 is correct.  Upper Paleolithic rock paintings in India predominantly feature linear representations of animal figures, using green and dark red pigments. These paintings reflect the artistic styles and techniques of the time, providing valuable insights into the symbolic and artistic expressions of early humans.

Statement 3 is correct.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic period rock paintings show a noticeable decline in the vibrancy and detail compared to earlier periods.  There's a shift towards simpler representations and a preference for white and red pigments, possibly made by grinding haematite and limestone.  This change in style may reflect evolving artistic conventions and technological advancements.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended to regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I resulted in the island becoming a Chola province for a brief period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja Chola I engaged in significant naval battles and expanded Chola power considerably, the text mentions the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandya and Chera kingdoms were both significant rivals of the Cholas. This subtle difference makes statement 1 incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra Chola I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the extent of Chola naval power and its reach beyond the Indian subcontinent.

Statement 3 is partially correct but needs clarification to be entirely accurate. While Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Sri Lanka did lead to the island becoming a Chola province,  the text does not specify the duration of this control.  It was significant, but not necessarily permanent or indefinite.  Therefore, while the core of the statement is accurate, the lack of precision makes it a less strong answer compared to statement 2.  The phrasing of option (c) accurately reflects this nuance.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a seasonal practice primarily associated with nomadic tribes in the Himalayas and is not practiced in the plains of India.
2. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance in 10 European States were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023.
3. Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes in the Himalayas who practice transhumance involving sheep and goats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, the text clearly states that this practice also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. This makes the statement about its exclusive association with the Himalayas false.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly mentions the declaration of the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance in 10 European States as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023 by UNESCO. This is a verifiable fact.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly lists Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas as Himalayan nomadic tribes who practice transhumance with sheep and goats.  This aligns perfectly with the description of transhumance provided in the text.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

2.  Manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only an International Register of significant documents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  This is a clear factual error.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the inclusion of manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This is directly stated in the provided text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  The statement's assertion that only an International Register exists is therefore false.


**4. With reference to the contributions and legacy of Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago was criticized for its lack of appeal to Western audiences.
2. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which primarily focuses on religious instruction and spiritual retreats.
3. Swami Vivekananda's teachings were primarily based on the Advaita Vedanta system, excluding other schools of Vedanta thought.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Swami Vivekananda's 1893 address was hailed as a success, describing him as an "orator by divine right" and a "Messenger of Indian wisdom to the Western world."  The statement contradicts this positive assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ramakrishna Mission was established in 1897, the text indicates that it engages in various forms of social service, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges – not solely religious instruction and retreats. This is a significant deviation from the statement's claim.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text states that Swami Vivekananda's Uttara Mimāṁsā (Vedanta) incorporates Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita, and Dvaita systems. The statement incorrectly claims that his teachings excluded other schools of Vedanta thought.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion, not $2 billion. This is a significant numerical discrepancy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that Tata Motors received an award for using vegan interiors in its *AVINYA* Concept car, not the Nexon EV.  The model name is a key detail that makes this statement inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The text confirms that Ratan Tata received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008 and the Padma Bhushan in 2000.  This is a straightforward factual recall.


**6. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that initially, the award was *not* conferred posthumously, but this changed in 1966.  The statement's implication of restricted posthumous conferrals is thus inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that recommendations are made by the Prime Minister to the President, not by a dedicated expert committee. This is a crucial difference in the award's procedure.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Bharat Ratna does not come with any monetary grant. This is a clear and directly stated fact.

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the Abhaya Mudra is displayed by the *fifth* Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not Vairocana.  This is a clear factual error about the specific Buddha associated with the mudra.

Statement 2 is correct. The text defines Abhaya Mudra as a symbol of fearlessness, aligning with the interpretation of protection, reassurance, and dispelling fear.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly links the Bhumisparsha Mudra to Buddha's overcoming of Mara during meditation, accurately describing its significance.


**8. With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the US, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the easy sale and export of Indian antiquities to the USA for research purposes.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPA's purpose is to *prevent* and *curb* illicit trafficking, not facilitate the sale and export of Indian antiquities. This is a direct contradiction of the agreement's stated aim.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that the agreement was signed on the sidelines of the *46th*, not 45th, World Heritage Committee meeting in New Delhi.  This is a factual inaccuracy regarding the meeting's number.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the CPA restricts the importation into the United States of certain archaeological and ethnological material of Indian origin.  This aligns directly with the agreement's purpose.


**9. With reference to National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that National Handloom Day commemorates the Swadeshi Movement launched on August 7, *1905*, not 1906.  This is a minor but significant chronological error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the handloom industry is India's largest cottage industry and the *second* largest employment provider in rural areas, not the largest. This is a key difference in the industry's ranking.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that approximately 70% of handloom weavers and allied workers are women. This is a directly stated fact.


**10. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, which is a multivoltine species, not *Bombyx mori* which is a univoltine species.  The silkworm species is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes Eri silk as the world's only vegan silk because the moth naturally exits the cocoon, and the silkworms are not killed.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clarifies that India produces *all five* types of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tropical & Temperate Tasar, and Muga. The statement underestimates the number of silk types produced in India.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the award was instituted in 1969, not 1970, to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary.  This is a factual error in the year of establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs. This is a numerical inaccuracy concerning the monetary value of the award.

Statement 3 is correct. The text lists Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, and Rajinikanth among the notable recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.  This is a verifiable list of past recipients.

(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Vikramshila was indeed a significant Buddhist university, the text doesn't specifically link it to the study of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.  The statement assumes a connection not explicitly made in the source.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text associates Megalithic culture with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, not the Vedic period. This is a significant difference in the historical timeframe.

(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly links the origin of the term "calico" to Kozhikode (Calicut).

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text states that Kozhikode was ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) in the medieval age, not the Nayakas. The ruling dynasty is a crucial historical detail.



**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty, founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, marked the empire's initial phase, followed by the Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign witnessed the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and significant victories against the Sultan of Bijapur, leading to the empire's territorial expansion.
3.  The Vijayanagara administration relied heavily on the Amara-Nayaka system, where military commanders were granted territories to govern, collecting taxes and retaining a portion for their expenses while maintaining temples and irrigation works.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire. The succession of dynasties (Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, Aravidu) is well-documented.  Krishnadevaraya's military successes and territorial expansion are also historical facts. The Amara-Nayaka system was a crucial component of the Vijayanagara administrative structure, granting considerable autonomy to regional governors while maintaining a centralized control over revenue and military affairs.  There is no evidence to suggest any of these statements are incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly describes Rajendra Chola I's significant naval expansion into Southeast Asia, reaching the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Statement 1 is incorrect because Rajaraja Chola's naval power extended beyond the Bay of Bengal, including conquests in Sri Lanka and other regions. Statement 3 is also inaccurate; while Chola naval prowess was undeniable, their successes also involved strategic alliances and diplomatic maneuvering.  The Chola expansion was a complex interplay of military might and political strategy.


**3. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Holkar dynasty was a prominent member of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside the Bhonsle of Nagpur, the Gaekwad of Baroda, and the Scindia of Gwalior.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately places the Holkar dynasty within the Maratha Confederacy alongside the other named powers. Statement 3 correctly describes the outcome of the Third Anglo-Maratha War and its consequence—the Treaty of Mandsaur.  Statement 2 is incorrect because Ahilyabai Holkar's rule was notable for significant social and economic reforms, including promoting women's education, resisting harmful practices, and boosting trade and commerce.  The statement misrepresents her focus.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly identifies the inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. Statement 1 is incorrect as the register encompasses works from various languages, not limited to Sanskrit and Pali.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing.


**5. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is a traditional practice primarily confined to the European Alps and the Himalayas.
2.  In 2023, Transhumance in 10 European States and Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the UNESCO recognition of transhumance traditions in Europe. Statement 3 correctly identifies the practice of transhumance in India and the nomadic tribes involved. Statement 1 is incorrect because transhumance is a widespread practice across various regions worldwide, not limited to the European Alps and Himalayas; it exists in many parts of the world including various plains in India.


**6.  With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra is a hand gesture primarily associated with the depiction of the Hindu god Vishnu.
2.  It symbolizes fearlessness and is often displayed by the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the Abhaya Mudra is a Buddhist hand gesture signifying fearlessness, and it is associated with Amoghasiddhi. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Abhaya Mudra is primarily a Buddhist, not a Hindu, gesture.  While both mudras have symbolic significance, Statement 3 is incorrect as they represent different concepts: Abhaya (fearlessness) and Bhumisparsha (calling the earth to witness).  They are distinct though both are associated with the Buddha.


**7. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative is solely implemented by the Cotton Corporation of India, aiming to improve the quality of Indian cotton.
2.  Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality Indian cotton with 100% traceability and certification, using blockchain technology.

(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Statement 2 accurately describes Kasturi Cotton's quality, traceability features, and use of blockchain technology. Statement 3 correctly identifies the initiative's aim to enhance global competitiveness and sustainability.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, the initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, trade bodies, and industry, not solely implemented by CCI.


**8. With reference to the  Sangameswar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal district (Andhra Pradesh) is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is located at the confluence of five rivers.
2.  Annual flooding from the Srisailam dam's backwaters submerges the Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal.
3. Sangameswar temples are found only in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is indeed annually submerged due to the backwaters of the Srisailam dam. Statement 1 is partially incorrect; the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu, and while situated at a river confluence, the number isn't precisely five.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Sangameswar temples exist in other states of India including Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.


**9.  With reference to the  Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kamakhya Temple is located on the Nilachal hills in Assam and is dedicated to Goddess Durga.
2.  The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, attracting numerous devotees.
3. The temple's architecture is entirely in the Nilachal style, a unique architectural tradition.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The Ambubachi Mela at Kamakhya Temple does indeed commemorate the yearly menstruation of the Goddess. Statement 1 is partially correct; the temple's location and deity are accurate, but it's dedicated to Goddess Kamakhya, a form of Shakti, not specifically Durga. Statement 3 is incorrect; while Nilachal style is present, the temple's architecture incorporates influences from other styles as well, reflecting a blend of architectural traditions.


**10. With reference to the  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement.
2.  He played a significant role in shaping the urban landscape of Mumbai, contributing to its infrastructure development.
3.  He was a staunch advocate for women's education, donating land for the establishment of girls' schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was instrumental in Mumbai's urban development, shaping its buildings and infrastructure. He was also a significant supporter of women's education, donating land for schools. Statement 1 is incorrect; he wasn't a major figure in the independence movement. His contributions were primarily focused on philanthropy and urban development in Bombay (Mumbai).


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended to regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I resulted in the island becoming a Chola province for a short period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja Chola I engaged in significant naval campaigns, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandya dynasty was another prominent power in South India, and while conflicts likely occurred, this specific detail is inaccurate as presented.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Rajendra Chola I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the far-reaching extent of Chola naval power and influence.

Statement 3 is partially correct but needs clarification.  While Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Sri Lanka did lead to it becoming a Chola province,  the duration of this control needs further qualification.  The text implies a significant period, but the exact length is not specified. The implication of "entire island" also needs nuance, as complete and lasting control might be an overstatement. The statement, though broadly true, lacks precision.

Therefore, only statement 2 is unequivocally correct as presented, while statement 3 requires qualification.  Option (c) is the most appropriate choice.


**2. With reference to UNESCO's initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses on the preservation of traditional agricultural practices.
2. The Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
3. The UNESCO Prix Versailles Award recognizes projects that are ecologically efficient, promote social interaction, and reflect local heritage, with the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in India being a shortlisted project.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage clearly states that the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, spearheaded by ICOMOS and backed by Azerbaijan, centers on the safeguarding of traditional seasonal livestock movements and associated cultural practices.  It doesn't directly mention agricultural practices; however, transhumance is intrinsically linked to pastoralism, a form of agriculture. Therefore, the statement is accurate in its broader context.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  This highlights the recognition of these Indian literary works as part of the world's documentary heritage.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage details that the UNESCO Prix Versailles Award focuses on innovative, culturally sensitive, ecologically sound projects that foster community engagement.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum's inclusion as a shortlisted project aligns with these criteria.

All three statements are accurate based on the provided text; therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**3. With reference to the Indian sports ecosystem, consider the following statements:**

1. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provides funding, specialized equipment, and coaching to India's elite athletes, but does not include a monthly allowance.
2. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program targets school children aged 9-18 years, focusing on grassroots talent development.
3. The "One School-One Sport" policy, implemented by the Ministry of Defence, mandates participation in only one sport within Sainik Schools.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that TOPS provides comprehensive assistance, *including* a monthly allowance, to India's top athletes.  The statement wrongly omits this key element of the scheme.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the KIRTI program's focus on identifying and nurturing young athletic talent (aged 9-18) at the grassroots level.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  While the "One School-One Sport" policy within Sainik Schools aims to promote focus on a single sporting discipline, the word "mandates" is overly strong.  The policy likely encourages specialization but may not strictly mandate it.  Therefore, the statement's phrasing is slightly inaccurate. However, the core intention of the policy is correctly reflected.

Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are closer to accurate representations of the facts, making option (c) the best answer.  The imprecision in statement 3 is less significant than the clear inaccuracy in statement 1.


**4. With reference to the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and India's role, consider the following statements:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi's initial anti-racial activism in South Africa predates the formal establishment of the AAM, laying the groundwork for later movements.
2.  India's contribution to the AAM included providing financial support through the AFRICA Fund and maintaining an ANC representative office in New Delhi.
3. The UN's response to apartheid involved imposing sanctions and declaring apartheid a crime against humanity in 1970.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text highlights Mahatma Gandhi's early activism against racial discrimination in South Africa, which significantly influenced subsequent anti-apartheid movements.  His actions laid a crucial foundation, even though the formal AAM emerged later.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions India's support for the AAM, including financial aid via the AFRICA Fund and the presence of an ANC office in New Delhi.  This underscores India's active role in the international struggle against apartheid.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the UN declared apartheid a crime against humanity in 1971, not 1970. This minor chronological error makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate, leading to option (a) as the correct answer.  The slight inaccuracy in statement 3 is enough to eliminate options (c) and (d).


**5. With reference to the National Film Awards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Initially called "State Awards," the National Film Awards were established in 1954 and are currently administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
2. The awards encompass three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema, with a "Most Film-Friendly State" award also presented.
3.  In the early years of the awards, the presentation included only two President's Gold Medals and a total of 14 silver medals for regional films.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately states that the National Film Awards originated in 1954 under the name "State Awards" and are presently managed by the Directorate of Film Festivals.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly identifies the three main award categories (Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema) and mentions the additional "Most Film-Friendly State" award.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage mentions 2 President's Gold Medals, 2 certificates of merit, and 12 silver medals in the initial years, totaling 16 awards, not 14. This numerical discrepancy makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Consequently, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct, making option (a) the appropriate selection.  The error in statement 3 is sufficient to rule out options (c) and (d).


**6.  With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, Nalanda University remained a prominent center of learning until the 13th century CE.
2.  The disciplines taught at Nalanda included Vedas, various schools of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, and astronomy, but not politics or war strategy.
3. The modern Nalanda University, inaugurated recently, aims to be a center for inter-civilizational dialogue and a "Net Zero Green Campus," established based on a decision made at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but contains a chronological inaccuracy. The text correctly identifies Kumargupta I as the founder in the 5th century CE. However, it states that Nalanda functioned until the 12th century, not the 13th. This minor discrepancy is significant enough for the statement to be considered incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly lists politics and war strategy among the subjects taught at ancient Nalanda.  The statement omits these crucial aspects of the curriculum.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage accurately describes the objectives of the modern Nalanda University, its commitment to environmental sustainability, and its origin in a 2007 EAS decision.

Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate as presented, making (b) seemingly correct. However,  statement 1's chronological inaccuracy is important, rendering (a) as the most accurate option given the inaccuracies present in the other statements.


**7. With reference to the  UNESCO’s Memory of the World (MOW) Programme and its Indian entries, consider the following statements:**

1. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National, with the International Register including entries from India such as the Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection and Rig Veda.
2. The MOW Programme aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage, ensure global access to this heritage, and raise public awareness about its significance.
3. The Panchatantra, a collection of Indian fables written in Sanskrit, is characterized by its unique "story within a story" structure and is included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately describes the MOW Programme's structure (International, Regional, and National registers) and its launch year (1992). It also correctly notes the presence of Indian entries like the Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection and the Rig Veda in the International Register.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately reflects the MOW Programme's goals: preservation, accessibility, and public awareness of documentary heritage.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly identifies the Panchatantra as a collection of Indian fables written in Sanskrit, highlights its "story within a story" structure, and confirms its inclusion in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

All three statements accurately reflect information from the provided text; therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**8. With reference to the International Day of Yoga (IDY), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IDY in 2014, coinciding with the Summer Solstice, upon India's proposal, garnering support from over 170 member states.
2. Yoga, originating in ancient India, is considered one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, with its systematic practices described in Patanjali's Yogasutra (2nd century BCE).
3.  The word "Yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," signifying the union of mind and body, and its practice is documented in seals and fossil remains from the Indus Valley Civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The passage correctly states that the UN declared June 21st as IDY in 2014, at India's initiative, and that it received widespread support. However, the number of supporting member states is stated as "a record 175," not "over 170."  This minor discrepancy, while seemingly small, makes the statement slightly inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage correctly identifies yoga as one of the six schools of Indian philosophy and accurately attributes the systematic description of yoga practices to Patanjali's Yogasutra.  The 2nd century BCE dating is also correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions that yoga's origins are traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization, it doesn't specify a date of 3000 BCE. It only mentions that seals and fossil remains indicate its presence dating back to 2700 BC.  The statement's dating is inaccurate.

Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are largely accurate, making (a) the most appropriate answer.  The slight inaccuracies in statements 1 and 3 are enough to eliminate other options.


**1. With reference to the contributions of Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago (1893) significantly influenced the propagation of Vedanta philosophy in the West.
2.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, primarily focused on promoting yoga and meditation practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's powerful and eloquent speech at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago introduced Vedanta philosophy to a Western audience, significantly impacting its reception and subsequent spread.  His presentation of Hinduism as a universal and tolerant religion challenged existing Western perceptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ramakrishna Mission did engage in spiritual practices, its activities extended far beyond yoga and meditation.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The register includes multiple works from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including other Indian works.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MoW programme was indeed launched in 1992, but it maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  This tiered system allows for broader inclusion and recognition of significant documentary heritage.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

This movement became a crucial step towards challenging the caste system's discriminatory practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mahatma Gandhi actively supported the Vaikom Satyagraha, although his approach differed from Periyar's.  Gandhi supported a mass agitation for temple entry in 1921, and his involvement significantly influenced the movement's trajectory and broader appeal.

Statement 3 is correct.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker played a crucial role in mobilizing volunteers and garnering public support for the Vaikom Satyagraha. His efforts were instrumental in sustaining the movement and highlighting the social injustices faced by lower-caste communities. His arrest during the movement showcased his commitment to the cause.

(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 was enacted *after* the rebellion, not to address the Santhals' grievances that caused the rebellion. Instead, it was a measure taken by the British to control the Santhal region and prevent future uprisings. The Act aimed to limit Santhal land alienation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Santhal Rebellion was largely a response to British land policies that dispossessed the Santhal people of their land and resources. The expansion of British influence and the encroachment upon Santhal territories were major factors that ignited the rebellion.



**14. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the British administration's policies and lack of preparedness played a role in exacerbating the famine, it wasn't a case of deliberate suppression of the Odia population.  A combination of factors, including natural disasters and economic mismanagement, contributed to the severity of the famine.

Statement 3 is correct.  Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, despite his role during the famine, later initiated several measures to improve education in rural Odisha, including establishing vernacular schools with a focus on the Odia language.  This reflects a complex legacy, with both negative and positive aspects associated with his tenure.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is incorrect. Saragarhi was a strategically vital communication post in the Samana Range, making its defense crucial for the British.  Its location on the communication line between two British forts made its capture a significant objective for the tribesmen.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, the highest British gallantry award given to Indian troops at that time, not the Victoria Cross.  The Victoria Cross was primarily awarded to British soldiers.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Budgetary allocations for sports in India have significantly increased since 2014-15, nearly doubling according to the provided text.  This reflects a greater emphasis on developing the sports infrastructure and supporting athletes.

Statement 2 is correct. The KIRTI program is specifically designed to identify and nurture young athletic talent among school children in the 9-18 age group.  This focus on grassroots development aims to create a strong pipeline of future athletes.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The TOPS scheme does not restrict its support only to athletes who have already won Olympic medals.  It provides comprehensive assistance to India's top athletes who show potential for winning medals at the Olympic Games, including funding, coaching, and other resources to support their training and participation in international competitions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The octagonal wall (Garh) in a Moidam is a significant architectural feature representing the Tai universe.  This reflects the cosmological beliefs of the Tai-Ahom people.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly states that pre-17th-century Tai-Ahom burial practices involved embalming and entombment, which later transitioned to cremation with the subsequent burial of ashes. This evolution in burial rites provides valuable insights into the changing cultural practices of the Tai-Ahoms over time.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Me-Dam-Me-Phi ritual, a form of ancestor worship, is explicitly mentioned as a 600-year-old tradition, indicating its antiquity and continuity within Tai-Ahom culture, directly contradicting the statement.  The longevity of this ritual highlights the cultural persistence and significance of ancestral veneration within the community.  The other options are incorrect because they include statement 3, which is factually inaccurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The museum was built to remember the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and was inaugurated in 2022, not 2023 as stated in option 1.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the museum is located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill and the Bhujio Fort is present there, the fort's construction date is given as 1723, not 1724, and it was built by Rao Godji, not Rao Khengarji I.  This highlights the importance of precise historical data.

Statement 3 is correct. The museum does indeed contain one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, implemented using the method pioneered by Akira Miyawaki.  This demonstrates the integration of ecological initiatives within the memorial's design.  The other options are incorrect as they include the factually inaccurate statement 2.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was instituted in 1969, not 1968, and it's presented annually, not biennially.  The precision of the year and frequency is crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The award includes a Golden Lotus medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ₹10 lakhs. This accurately describes the components of the award.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Satyajit Ray received the award in 1985, not 1984.  The difference of one year, while seemingly minor, demonstrates the need for precise factual recall in this context.  Option (b) is the only correct answer because it is the only option that correctly identifies statement 2 as true.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bengal Gazette was founded on January 29, 1780, not 1781.

Statement 2 is correct. The newspaper was indeed published weekly in Kolkata (then Calcutta) and was shut down in 1782, not 1783, following its criticism of Warren Hastings.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  James Augustus Hicky was an Irishman, not an Englishman.  The nationality detail, while seemingly minor, is important for factual accuracy.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, launched by UNESCO in 1992, indeed maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  These registers document significant documentary heritage across the globe. Statement 1 is thus correct.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The International Register includes entries from various countries, not exclusively UNESCO member states, reflecting the global nature of documentary heritage preservation.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While the MoW Programme aims to enhance universal access to documentary heritage and increase public awareness, its focus isn't solely on digitization.  Preservation in various forms, including physical archiving, is also crucial. The programme prioritizes the preservation of significant documents, not necessarily all documents.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a key aspect of the MoW Programme.


**2. With reference to ancient Indian literature, consider the following statements:**

1. The *Ramcharitmanas*, written in Sanskrit during the 16th century, is a poetic retelling of the *Mahabharata*.
2.  The *Panchatantra*, a collection of fables, is notable for its unique "story within a story" structure and was originally written in Tamil.
3. *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, a text on Indian poetics, was authored by Abhinavagupta and later commented upon by Acharya Anandvardhan.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the *Ramcharitmanas*, while a poetic retelling of the Ramayana, was written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit, by Goswami Tulsidas. Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts: the *Panchatantra* was written in Sanskrit by Vishnu Sharma, not Tamil, and its distinctive feature is indeed the "story within a story" structure. Statement 3 reverses the roles of the author and commentator.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, a text on Indian poetics, was authored by Acharya Anandvardhan, and Abhinavagupta wrote a commentary on it. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is not awarded annually; it is conferred upon select writers, recognizing their lifetime contributions.  Statement 2 is correct; the Fellowship is indeed the highest honour of the Akademi and is reserved for writers of exceptional stature. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ruskin Bond is a notable recipient who primarily writes in English, other recipients have also written primarily in English. The selection is based on literary merit, not language. Thus, only statement 2 is accurate.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not his enlightenment. Statement 2 is correct; the Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the IBC, does observe IAD. Statement 3 is incorrect. The declaration of Pali as a classical language was indeed celebrated during a recent IAD observance. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the architectural features of the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vimana (Garbhagriha) of the Shree Jagannath Temple is built in the Rekha deula style, a sub-style of Kalinga architecture, which is characterized by a curvilinear tower.  Statement 2 is correct. The Jagamohana is indeed a Pidha deula with tiers of diminishing platforms. Statement 3 is also correct; the temple's outer walls do feature carvings depicting 24 forms of Vishnu. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha (a form of Shiva), not Vishnu, and it is located in Karnataka, not Andhra Pradesh. Statement 2 is correct; the temple's pavilion did collapse due to heavy rains. Statement 3 is also correct. The Sangama and Tuluva dynasties of the Vijayanagara Empire played crucial roles in the temple's expansion and development. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Harappan civilization had a developed agricultural system alongside trade. Statement 2 is correct. The use of standardized weights and measures is well-documented evidence of their sophisticated trade networks. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Harappan script remains undeciphered, preventing a complete understanding of their religious beliefs, though archaeological findings offer some insights. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**9. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC is being developed at Lothal, Gujarat, under the Sagarmala Programme.
2.  Lothal is significant for its discovery of the oldest known man-made dry dock.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NMHC is indeed being developed at Lothal under the Sagarmala Programme. Statement 2 is also correct; Lothal is renowned for its ancient dry dock. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMHC aims to showcase India's maritime heritage across all historical periods, not just the colonial era.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tuluva Dynasty marked the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire, not its decline. The decline began later, under the Aravidu Dynasty. Statement 2 is correct.  Krishnadevaraya's reign was indeed a period of significant expansion and military success. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Amara-Nayakas were military commanders given territories, their positions were largely hereditary, and they collected taxes, retaining a portion for themselves.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was born in the village of Chondi, in present-day Rajasthan.
2. She became the ruler of Malwa after the death of her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar.
3.  She is primarily known for her patronage of the arts, particularly Sanskrit literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar was born in Chondi, in present-day Maharashtra, not Rajasthan. Statement 2 is correct. She did ascend to power following the death of her father-in-law. Statement 3 is partially correct; while she did patronize the arts, her most significant contributions were in temple reconstruction, not solely Sanskrit literature.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully accurate.  Her patronage extended to various artistic and literary fields, including Marathi literature.


**12. With reference to the temples reconstructed by Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Vishvanath Temple in Varanasi was completely rebuilt by Ahilyabai Holkar after its destruction by Aurangzeb.
2. The Somnath Temple in Gujarat was one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, and Ahilyabai Holkar's reconstruction efforts followed its destruction by Mahmud of Ghazni.
3.  Al-Biruni's writings provide a detailed description of the Somnath Temple prior to Ahilyabai Holkar's reconstruction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar significantly contributed to the Kashi Vishvanath Temple's reconstruction, it wasn't completely rebuilt after its destruction by Aurangzeb; earlier structures remained.  Statement 2 is partially correct. The Somnath Temple was indeed one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, but Ahilyabai Holkar's reconstruction followed multiple destructions over centuries, not solely that by Mahmud of Ghazni. Statement 3 is correct; Al-Biruni did offer a description of the Somnath Temple in his writings. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are substantially accurate, although with necessary qualifications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu, and is situated at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers along with five other tributaries.  The statement incorrectly attributes the deity and overstates the number of rivers involved.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kamakhya Temple's reconstruction in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty indeed incorporated elements of Nilachal, Upper Burmese, Pala, and Ahom architectural styles, reflecting the region's diverse cultural influences. This fusion of styles is a key characteristic of the temple's architecture.

Statement 3 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi's construction spanned centuries, with its origins tracing back to the 8th century under a Chalukya queen. Subsequent rulers, including those from the Vijayanagara Empire, significantly expanded and enhanced the temple complex, leading to its present grandeur and architectural significance.  The statement accurately captures the temple's evolution and architectural style.


**2. With reference to the Jyotirlingas and associated pilgrimage sites, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kedarnath Temple is indeed one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and is a crucial part of the Char Dham Yatra, along with Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Badrinath. This is a well-established fact in Hindu pilgrimage lore.

Statement 2 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, the queen of Malwa, is known for her significant contributions to the restoration and renovation of several temples across India, including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. This is a widely documented aspect of her reign.

Statement 3 is correct.  Somnath Temple, located on the Gujarat coast, is considered the first Jyotirlinga.  It has a rich history of destruction and reconstruction, suffering damage from Mahmud of Ghazni and others. Ahilyabai Holkar is credited with significant restoration efforts at the temple.  The statement accurately reflects its historical context and Ahilyabai Holkar's role.


**3. With reference to significant religious sites in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Alagar Temple's description accurately reflects its dedication to Lord Vishnu (as Kallazhagar), its mention in Silappadikaram and Alvars' hymns, and its architectural feature of six corridors within fort walls. These details are consistent with historical and religious accounts of the temple.

Statement 2 is correct. Jyotirmath's association with Adi Shankaracharya, its role as one of his four cardinal mathas promoting Advaita Vedanta, and its function as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath are all accurate and well-documented facts.

Statement 3 is correct. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex's UNESCO World Heritage status, the architectural style of its main temple (classical Indian with a curvilinear shikhara), and the presence of the Vajrasana are all accurate details. The description aligns with established knowledge about the temple and its historical significance.


**4. With reference to the historical and archaeological sites of India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

3. Mithun Chakraborty was conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke Lifetime Achievement Award for 2022, India's highest award in cinema.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**1. With reference to the economic policies of the Holkar dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic policies focused primarily on temple reconstruction and patronage of arts, with limited direct involvement in agricultural or trade reforms.
2. The Holkar dynasty's revenue collection system heavily relied on the traditional 'Chouth' and 'Sardeshmukhi' practices inherited from the Peshwas.
3.  Tukoji Rao Holkar, as commander of Devi Ahilyabai's army, played a significant role in securing trade routes and ensuring the stability of the Malwa region's economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign is indeed marked by significant temple reconstruction and patronage of arts and literature. However, her rule also involved practical economic considerations.  While her focus may not have been on large-scale, sweeping economic reforms like those seen in later periods, her actions indirectly impacted the economy. Temple construction, for example, stimulated local employment and trade.  Patronage of artists and scholars also contributed to the cultural and intellectual vibrancy of the region, potentially attracting skilled individuals and boosting local economies.  The statement concerning the reliance on 'Chouth' and 'Sardeshmukhi' is accurate. These traditional revenue collection methods were inherited and continued within the Holkar administration. This system, while having its limitations, represented a significant aspect of their economic structure.  The third statement is also correct.  Tukoji Rao Holkar's role as commander of the army directly contributed to the economic stability of the region. A secure environment conducive to trade and commerce was crucial for economic prosperity, and maintaining peace and stability was a key aspect of Tukoji Rao's role.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect different aspects of the Holkar dynasty's economic policies and practices.


**2. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty's administration and economy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings held absolute power, with limited influence from the Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris).
2.  The Ahom economy was primarily agrarian, with significant reliance on rice cultivation and trade in local products.
3. The Ahom dynasty's downfall was solely due to internal conflicts and succession crises, without significant external pressures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first statement is incorrect.  The Ahom administration, while a monarchy, did not grant the king absolute power. The Patra Mantris, the council of ministers, held significant influence and played a crucial role in the appointment of kings and the overall governance of the kingdom. A king needed their concurrence for his appointment.  The second statement is accurate. The Ahom economy was largely agrarian, with rice cultivation being a cornerstone of their economic activities. They also engaged in trade, exchanging local products within the region and beyond.  The third statement is false. While internal conflicts might have played a role, the Ahom dynasty's downfall was significantly influenced by external factors. The Burmese invasions and the subsequent involvement of the British East India Company were major contributors to the kingdom's decline and eventual annexation. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects aspects of the Ahom Dynasty.


**3. With reference to the impact of the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha directly resulted in the immediate abolition of the caste system in Travancore.
2. The movement significantly contributed to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting access to temples for lower-caste individuals.
3. The Vaikom Satyagraha led to a complete reconciliation between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first statement is incorrect. While the Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant step towards challenging caste discrimination, it did not immediately abolish the caste system in Travancore. The caste system was a deeply entrenched social structure, and its dismantling was a gradual process involving various social and political reforms.  The second statement is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha played a crucial role in raising awareness about caste discrimination and mobilizing public opinion.  It contributed significantly to the eventual Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, which granted lower-caste individuals access to temples.  The third statement is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha actually highlighted the existing differences in approaches between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker.  While Gandhi focused on Hindu reform, Periyar viewed the issue through the lens of broader anti-caste struggles. The partial success of the Satyagraha (opening only three of the four roads to the temple) further exacerbated their differences, leading to Periyar's departure from the Congress.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion was primarily a localized uprising with limited impact on British colonial policies.
2.  The Santhal Rebellion was led solely by male leaders, without significant involvement from women.
3. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 was enacted as a direct response to the demands raised during the Santhal Rebellion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion, while initially localized, had a significant impact on British colonial policies. It highlighted the widespread discontent among tribal communities and prompted the British to re-evaluate their administrative approaches in the region. The rebellion's scale and intensity forced the British to implement certain administrative and legislative changes.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion was significantly led by both male and female leaders.  The sisters Phulo and Jhano played crucial roles alongside the male leaders Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav. Their participation underlines the importance of women's agency in the rebellion.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876, while enacted after the rebellion, was not a direct response to the rebels' demands. Instead, it aimed to contain future uprisings by restricting land transfers and establishing a separate administrative unit (Santhal Parganas) for the Santhal community. The act did not address the root causes of the rebellion.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I primarily focused on land-based conquests and had limited involvement in naval expeditions.
2. The Chola navy's victory at Kandalursalai was a decisive battle that significantly weakened the Chera navy.
3. Rajendra Chola I's conquests extended to regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja Chola I was known for his significant naval power and ambitious naval expeditions. His naval strength was a cornerstone of his military and political strategy, enabling him to conquer territories across the Indian Ocean.  Statement 2 is correct. The Chola navy's victory at Kandalursalai was a major naval victory against the Cheras, significantly weakening their naval power and enhancing Chola dominance in the region.  Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra Chola I, the successor of Rajaraja Chola I, continued and expanded upon the naval conquests. His expeditions reached Southeast Asia, resulting in the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrating the reach and power of the Chola navy.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**6. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement allows visa-free travel for all Sikh pilgrims from Pakistan to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India.
2. The agreement permits daily visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.
3.  The agreement restricts access to the corridor based on the religious faith of the pilgrims.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement does *not* grant visa-free travel to Sikh pilgrims from Pakistan to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India.  The agreement is primarily focused on facilitating the movement of Indian and OCI cardholders to Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan.  Statement 2 is correct. The agreement does indeed facilitate daily visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan. This was a key objective of the agreement.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The agreement explicitly states that there is *no* restriction on the religious faith of pilgrims using the corridor.  Any individual, regardless of their faith, is permitted to travel through the corridor provided they meet the other stipulated requirements.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the individuals who received the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  M.S. Swaminathan was awarded the Bharat Ratna for his contributions to the field of agriculture.
2. P.V. Narasimha Rao received the Bharat Ratna primarily for his leadership during the demolition of the Babri Masjid.
3. Chaudhary Charan Singh's Bharat Ratna was awarded posthumously for his contributions to Indian agriculture and farmers' rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. M.S. Swaminathan, a renowned agricultural scientist, was indeed awarded the Bharat Ratna for his groundbreaking contributions to the Green Revolution in India and his overall work in improving agricultural practices and food security.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While P.V. Narasimha Rao's tenure as Prime Minister was a period of significant political events, including the demolition of the Babri Masjid, his Bharat Ratna was not awarded specifically for his handling of this event.  The award recognized his broader contributions to Indian politics and his role in economic liberalization.  Statement 3 is correct. Chaudhary Charan Singh, a prominent leader known for his advocacy for farmers' rights, received the Bharat Ratna posthumously in recognition of his work in improving the lives of Indian farmers and advancing agricultural policies. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**8. With reference to the Apartheid struggle in South Africa and Nelson Mandela's role, consider the following statements:**

1. Nelson Mandela's philosophy was significantly influenced by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.
2. The United Nations declared Apartheid a crime against humanity in 1962, leading to the immediate imposition of sanctions on South Africa.
3. Nelson Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, the same year he became President of South Africa.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nelson Mandela's philosophy and approach to the struggle against apartheid were indeed deeply influenced by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, particularly the principles of non-violent resistance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UN did declare apartheid a crime against humanity, this happened in 1973, not 1962. The imposition of sanctions on South Africa was a gradual process, occurring over several years.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Nelson Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, one year before he became President of South Africa in 1994.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha Famine was primarily caused by a severe drought, with minimal influence from British administrative policies.
2. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, the Commissioner of the Odisha division during the famine, was widely praised for his effective famine relief efforts.
3. The construction of the Puri Canal was a direct consequence of the Odisha Famine, aimed at improving irrigation and preventing future famines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Odisha Famine of 1866 was not solely caused by a severe drought.  British administrative policies, including inadequate relief measures and ineffective governance, significantly exacerbated the impact of the drought. The famine highlights the failures of the colonial administration to effectively address the crisis.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, while he did undertake some post-famine initiatives, was widely criticized for his handling of the famine relief efforts. His actions are seen as contributing to the severity of the famine's impact.  Statement 3 is correct. The construction of the Puri Canal, also known as the Coast Canal, was indeed a direct consequence of the Odisha Famine. The famine exposed the need for improved irrigation systems, and the canal was built to address this deficiency and prevent future famines. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**10. With reference to the Battle of Saragarhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army and Afghan forces.
2.  The Sikh soldiers who fought at Saragarhi were all members of the 36th Sikh Regiment.
3. The Battle of Saragarhi took place in present-day India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army (specifically, 21 soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment) and Orakzai and Afridi Pashtun tribesmen, not Afghan forces.  Statement 2 is correct. All 21 Sikh soldiers who fought in the Battle of Saragarhi were indeed members of the 36th Sikh Regiment. This is a well-documented fact about the battle.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Battle of Saragarhi took place at Saragarhi, which is located in present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, not in India. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

While it's predominantly associated with mountainous areas, the practice isn't limited to them, as evidenced by its presence in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh (as mentioned in the provided text).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland is indeed a recognized example of transhumance, but the text explicitly states that this practice *is* prevalent in the Indian Himalayas, involving the nomadic tribes listed in Statement 3.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, the statement incorrectly attributes the establishment of the register to 1992. The international MOW Programme was launched in 1992, but the regional registers were established later.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National, reflecting the hierarchical structure for documenting and preserving world memory.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the new Nalanda University campus is indeed a "Net Zero Green Campus" and located in Rajgir, Bihar, the statement misrepresents the origin of the university's establishment.  The decision to establish the new Nalanda University was made at the *2nd*, not the 1st, East Asia Summit in the Philippines in 2007.

The Tata Group's expansion under his leadership transformed it into a global conglomerate and a major employer within India. Statement 2 accurately describes Tata Motors' recognition by PETA India for its innovative use of vegan materials, showcasing the company's commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. This reflects a broader trend within the Tata Group towards corporate social responsibility.

The Nano's launch, while controversial in some aspects, significantly impacted the Indian automobile market.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making option (c) the appropriate answer.

(a) 1 only

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President of India grants the Bharat Ratna, there isn't a formal selection committee with stringent predefined criteria.  The Prime Minister makes recommendations to the President, although the process isn't rigidly formalized. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Bharat Ratna doesn't come with any monetary reward; it's purely an honorary award recognizing exceptional contributions to the nation. Statement 3 is correct; P.V. Narasimha Rao, Chaudhary Charan Singh, and M.S. Swaminathan are indeed among the distinguished recipients of the Bharat Ratna.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate, making option (b) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly include statements containing inaccurate information about the award's selection process and associated benefits.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions did indeed result in the conquest of Sri Lanka, which became a Chola province for a period.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions Rajaraja Chola I destroying the Chera navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai. This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  Statement 3 is correct. Nagapattinam was indeed a crucial naval base and a major trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating its extensive maritime trade throughout Southeast Asia and beyond. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate, making option (a) the correct answer. Option (c) is incorrect because of the inaccuracy in statement 2.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The KIRTI program targets school children aged 9-18, focusing on identifying talent at the grassroots level, not just elite athletes. This is a key difference that demonstrates the need for careful reading and understanding of program specifics. Statement 2 is correct. TOPS indeed provides extensive support to India's top athletes, encompassing funding, equipment, coaching, and international exposure, aiming to boost their performance and medal prospects. Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that budgetary allocation for sports has nearly doubled between 2014-15 and 2023-24, indicating growth, not stagnation. This is a crucial factual detail that contrasts directly with the statement.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the appropriate answer. The other options include statements with factual inaccuracies regarding the target groups and budgetary trends in Indian sports.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While private industry is involved, Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Textiles, involving the Cotton Corporation of India and trade bodies, not solely private companies.  Statement 2 is correct.  Blockchain technology is indeed a core component of the initiative, enabling complete traceability and certification, thereby ensuring the premium quality of Kasturi Cotton. Statement 3 is also correct. TEXPROCIL is explicitly mentioned as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the appropriate choice.  Option (a) is incorrect because it wrongly attributes the initiative's primary driving force to private companies. Option (c) is also incomplete, omitting the correct detail about TEXPROCIL's role.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Project PARI is a joint initiative executed by both Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not solely by the latter.  This shows the importance of attention to detail in understanding the collaborative nature of the project. Statement 2 is correct. The project's primary goal is indeed to democratize art by making it more accessible through public installations, transforming urban spaces into accessible art galleries. Statement 3 is also correct. The text explicitly states that the initial implementation of Project PARI is in Delhi, featuring various traditional Indian art forms, including those mentioned in the statement.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate, leading to option (b) as the correct answer. Option (a) is incomplete, while options (c) and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding the project's implementing bodies.

(a) 1 only

(d) 2 and 3 only

This indicates the importance of understanding the scale of government programs. Statement 2 is correct. The initiative's primary goal is to promote responsible tourism practices across the 50 destinations, aiming for sustainable and environmentally conscious tourism growth. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ministry of Tourism, not the Ministry of Culture, launched the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative. This highlights the importance of precise attribution of government initiatives to the correct ministries.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making option (b) the correct answer. The other options contain inaccuracies regarding the initiative's scope and the responsible ministry.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

This underscores the need for precise numerical accuracy in answering UPSC questions. Statement 2 is correct. The MOW program's aim is indeed to preserve and promote documentary heritage, enhancing public awareness of its value. Statement 3 is also correct. The text accurately describes the decision-making process and the location of the MOWCAP meeting.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies concerning the number of Indian works included in the register.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The International Abhidhamma Divas commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not his enlightenment. This demonstrates the importance of precise understanding of Buddhist events. Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the IBC, does observe the IAD. Statement 3 is also correct.  The text correctly mentions the celebration of Pali's declaration as a classical language in conjunction with IAD.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the appropriate answer.  Option (a) contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the event commemorated by IAD. Options (c) and (d) are also incomplete due to the error in statement 1.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

3. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and military victories against the Sultan of Bijapur.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire reached its zenith under the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Sangama Dynasty. This highlights the importance of knowing the correct dynasty associated with the empire's peak. Statement 2 is correct. The Amara-Nayakas system accurately describes the decentralized administrative structure of the empire, with military commanders ruling granted territories and managing revenue. Statement 3 is also correct.  Krishnadevaraya's reign is indeed known for these significant military and territorial achievements.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (d) the appropriate answer. Option (a) is incorrect due to the error in statement 1. Options (b) and (c) are incomplete due to the same error.




**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on a report submitted by the Ministry of Culture, assessing its national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, defines the term "Missing Monuments" and provides a clear procedure for handling such cases.
3.  The delisting of a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, automatically leads to its removal from all lists of protected heritage sites maintained by the ASI and the Ministry of Culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI uses reports from the Ministry of Culture to determine a monument's national importance before delisting it. This process is crucial for ensuring that only those monuments lacking significant national value are removed from the protected list, thereby prioritizing the preservation of truly significant heritage sites.  The assessment involves factors such as historical significance, architectural merit, and current state of preservation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not formally recognized within the AMASR Act, 1958.  This term emerged from the reports of the CAG audit team. The Act itself focuses on the declaration and protection of monuments and doesn't specifically address the administrative category of 'missing' monuments.  The act primarily deals with the processes of declaring a monument's national importance, its protection, and the regulations surrounding archaeological excavations and the preservation of associated artifacts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While delisting a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act removes ASI protection and maintenance, it doesn't automatically remove it from *all* lists.  The monument might still be recorded in various historical archives or inventories maintained by other organizations or state governments.  The delisting primarily concerns the ASI’s responsibilities regarding conservation and protection.  Other agencies may maintain separate records or designations related to the monument's historical or cultural value.


**2. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Padma Awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases, and the decision rests solely with the President of India.
2. The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Shri recognizes exceptional and distinguished service.
3.  Recipients of Padma Awards are permitted to use the title as a suffix or prefix to their names.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Padma Awards are typically not given posthumously, the government may make exceptions in highly deserving cases. The final decision, however, rests with the government, not solely the President. The President confers the awards but acts on the recommendations of the government's selection committee.

Statement 2 is incorrect. It reverses the descriptions of Padma Vibhushan and Padma Shri.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri recognizes distinguished service of a high order.  The hierarchical order of the awards reflects the level of achievement being recognized.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Padma Awards do not constitute titles and cannot be used as a suffix or prefix to a recipient's name. This is explicitly stated in the award guidelines to maintain the integrity and dignity of the honor, emphasizing recognition of achievement rather than the bestowal of a formal title.


**3. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented annually to retiring central government employees who have demonstrated exceptional leadership qualities during their service.
2.  The selection for the Anubhav Awards is based solely on the assessment of the candidate's performance reports throughout their career.
3. The Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare instituted the Anubhav Awards to recognize and reward outstanding service in public administration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are not presented annually, nor are they solely based on leadership qualities.  The frequency of the award ceremony varies and the awards are based on the "Anubhav Write-ups" submitted by retiring employees. This allows a broader range of experiences and contributions to be considered.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The selection isn't based solely on performance reports. It is primarily based on the quality and impact of the "Anubhav Write-ups," which are personal reflections and accounts of the employee's experiences, insights, and lessons learned during their career.  These write-ups are submitted through the Anubhav Portal.

Statement 3 is correct. The Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare established the Anubhav Awards to encourage the sharing of experiences from retiring employees to promote good governance and administrative reforms.  The program aims to leverage the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of retiring personnel to improve future administrative practices.


**4. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra were initially instituted as Class II and Class III of the Ashoka Chakra, respectively.
3.  The President of India is solely responsible for selecting the recipients of all Gallantry Awards, without any advisory committee input.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ashoka Chakra was instituted later, in 1952, not in 1950 along with the wartime Gallantry Awards.  The wartime awards were established to recognize exceptional bravery during armed conflicts.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra were originally Class II and Class III of the Ashoka Chakra.  They were later renamed in 1967, but their origins are linked to the original Ashoka Chakra hierarchy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the President confers the awards, the selection process involves various recommendations and inputs from relevant authorities within the armed forces and other agencies.  The President doesn't operate in isolation; the selection process involves a significant degree of consultation and review.


**5. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" and were instituted in 1960.
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has been administering the National Film Awards since 1973.
3.  The awards are presented only in the categories of Feature Films and Non-Feature Films.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Film Awards were instituted in 1954, not 1960, and were initially called "State Awards". The timeline of the award's inception and the initial naming convention are important factual details.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directorate of Film Festivals has been responsible for administering the National Film Awards since 1973. This administrative aspect reflects the organizational structure and evolution of the award process.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  In addition to Feature Films and Non-Feature Films, the awards also include the category of "Best Writing in Cinema".  This category recognizes outstanding contributions to screenwriting and reflects the broader scope of cinematic excellence.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award is granted annually, not biennially.  The annual nature of the award underscores its ongoing commitment to recognizing excellence in contemporary architecture.

Statement 2 is correct. The award encompasses a broad range of building types, demonstrating the wide-ranging scope of its recognition of architectural achievements across diverse contexts.

Statement 3 is correct.  Ecological efficiency and social interaction are key criteria considered during the judging process, reflecting the award's emphasis on sustainable and socially responsible architecture.  The emphasis on these factors aligns with broader global sustainability goals and the social impact of built environments.

3. The library, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," housed over nine million books, organized across nine floors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, not by Chandragupta Maurya in the 4th century BCE. The founder and the period of establishment are crucial details about the university's history.  The significant difference in the timelines indicates a misunderstanding of the historical context.

Statement 2 is correct. The curriculum of Nalanda University was indeed multidisciplinary and extensive, covering a broad range of subjects from religious studies to sciences and the arts.  The inclusivity of the curriculum highlights its significance as a major center of learning.

Statement 3 is correct.  The description of the library as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," containing a vast collection of books, is consistent with historical accounts. The scale and organization of the library emphasize its role as a repository of knowledge.

3. The Satyagraha concluded on November 30, 1925, resulting in the immediate and complete removal of all restrictions on temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against the discriminatory practices that prevented lower-caste Hindus from accessing the temple.  The date of commencement and the central issue of the Satyagraha are well-established historical facts.

Statement 2 is correct. The broad-based support for the Vaikom Satyagraha, including participation from various religious and social groups, demonstrates the movement's significance in challenging caste-based discrimination.  The cross-community support reflects the movement's ability to transcend religious boundaries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Satyagraha was officially withdrawn on November 30, 1925, it did not result in the immediate and complete removal of all restrictions.  The complete removal of restrictions on temple entry came later with the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.  The immediate outcome was more limited, highlighting the gradual nature of social reform.

Statement 2 is correct.  Bismil, Khan, and Roshan Singh were indeed prominent figures involved in the conspiracy, highlighting the leadership and participation of key revolutionaries.  Their roles underscore the leadership structure within the HRA.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Not all involved received the death penalty; some received long-term imprisonment.  The varied sentencing reflects the legal processes and the different roles played by the individuals involved in the conspiracy.  The statement oversimplifies the complex outcomes of the trial.

(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Apartheid laws affected Black Africans, Coloureds, and Indians, all of whom faced various forms of discrimination and segregation under the system.  The statement incorrectly minimizes the impact of Apartheid on non-Black African populations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The AAM was a significant transnational social movement, garnering widespread international support and leading to international sanctions against the apartheid regime.  The statement underestimates the global impact and influence of the movement.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the symbolism incorporated into the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court. The saree signifies a departure from colonial symbolism and an embrace of Indian cultural identity. The removal of the blindfold represents a departure from the traditional depiction of blind justice and emphasizes the law's awareness of societal nuances and the need for equitable application.  Replacing the sword with the Constitution highlights the constitutional framework as the foundation of justice in India, prioritizing constitutional values over mere punitive measures.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, which began in 1924, was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi and aimed to secure temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement, it was primarily spearheaded by leaders like T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan. The movement aimed to secure temple entry but was not solely led by Gandhi. Statement 2 is correct; the Vaikom Satyagraha played a significant role in paving the way for the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936. Statement 3 is also correct. Periyar, while initially supportive, later withdrew due to dissatisfaction with the partial success (only three out of four roads leading to the temple were opened).  His disagreement stemmed from his broader critique of the caste system, going beyond temple entry.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Kakori Train Action aimed to fund revolutionary activities, it was executed in Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal.  Statement 2 is correct; these individuals were key participants in the Kakori conspiracy. Statement 3 is incorrect; the HRA's activities were primarily focused in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of North India, not Travancore, and their aim was to overthrow British rule, not solely targeting feudal systems.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.

(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for delisting monuments that are no longer considered of national importance. Statement 3 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not an official classification under the AMASR Act. It's a term used informally.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

3.  Initially, the Bharat Ratna was not conferred posthumously, but this practice changed later.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna was instituted in 1954, not 1952, and while it's conferred annually, it's not necessarily on Republic Day.  It can be conferred on other occasions as well. Statement 2 is incorrect; recipients are *not* permitted to use "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name. Statement 3 is correct; the award was initially not given posthumously but later the practice changed. Therefore, only statement 3 is fully accurate.  The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding the year of institution and the use of the award title.


**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act, 1958, empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that are deemed to have ceased to be of national importance.
2.  The term "Missing Monuments" is explicitly defined within the AMASR Act, 1958, to categorize monuments that are untraceable.
3. Section 4 of the AMASR Act, 1958, solely focuses on the regulation of archaeological excavations and the protection of sculptures and carvings.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed grants the Central Government the power to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance. This is a crucial aspect of the Act, allowing for the reassessment and reclassification of protected monuments based on changing circumstances or new information.  The process involves a thorough evaluation, and if a monument is determined to have lost its national significance, it can be delisted, freeing the area from the restrictions imposed by the Act.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" does not feature in the original AMASR Act, 1958. This term emerged later, likely through usage by auditing bodies like the CAG, to describe monuments that are untraceable or whose locations are unknown.  The Act itself doesn't provide a formal definition or category for such monuments.


Statement 3 is incorrect. While Section 4 of the AMASR Act, 1958, does indeed address the regulation of archaeological excavations and the protection of sculptures and carvings, it is not the *sole* focus of this section.  The Act encompasses a broader mandate for the preservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites.  Section 4 is a part of a larger legal framework aimed at safeguarding India's cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, they are *not* conferred posthumously in all deserving cases. While exceptions might be made in rare instances, the general rule is that these awards are not given posthumously.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Padma Awards are indeed given in three categories (Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri), but they are *not* titles that can be used as prefixes or suffixes to names.  The awards are prestigious recognitions, but they do not carry titular connotations.


Statement 3 is correct. The Padma Awards are indeed among the highest civilian awards in India and are announced annually on Republic Day. This is a well-established aspect of the Indian awards system.

The provided text mentions another Indian project, the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru, which also received the award in 2023.  This detail serves as a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prix Versailles Award is granted annually at UNESCO since 2015 and does categorize projects into 24 World Titles, reflecting the diverse range of architectural achievements it considers.

Statement 3 is correct.  The criteria for the award clearly include innovation, reflection of local heritage, and promotion of social interaction. These are essential aspects of the award's philosophy and selection process.  They emphasize the holistic impact of architectural projects.


**1. With reference to the Chola Dynasty's maritime expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly extended Chola influence to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, establishing a vast maritime empire.
3. The Chola navy's dominance was solely attributed to their superior shipbuilding techniques, neglecting the role of strategic alliances and monsoon winds in their maritime success.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions extended beyond the Coromandel Coast.  His victories at Kandalursalai against the Cheras and his conquests in Sri Lanka demonstrate a broader reach than just regional dominance. While the Coromandel Coast was a key area of control, his ambitions were clearly beyond it.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire represents a significant expansion of Chola power into Southeast Asia.  His campaign extended Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the dynasty's impressive naval capabilities and establishing a far-flung maritime empire. This expansion is well-documented in historical records.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While superior shipbuilding techniques were undoubtedly a factor in Chola naval dominance, attributing their success solely to this aspect is an oversimplification. The Chola navy's success also relied heavily on strategic alliances, understanding of monsoon winds for navigation, and effective military strategies.  Ignoring these elements presents an incomplete picture of their maritime prowess.  The Chola's success was a complex interplay of technological advancement, political maneuvering, and geographical understanding.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative, spearheaded by UNESCO, focuses exclusively on preserving transhumance practices within the European Union, neglecting other regions with similar traditions.
2. Transhumance, a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement, is primarily confined to mountainous regions, with minimal presence in plains areas.
3. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland, recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, exemplifies the cultural significance and economic importance of transhumance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while supported by Azerbaijan, is not solely focused on the European Union.  The initiative aims to acknowledge and protect this traditional practice globally, recognizing its importance across various regions and cultures.  The inclusion of Indian transhumance practices demonstrates this broader scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in mountainous regions like the Himalayas, it's not exclusively confined to them.  The text explicitly mentions the existence of this practice in plains areas of India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. This highlights the diversity of geographical contexts in which transhumance occurs.

Statement 3 is correct. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland's recognition as an Intangible Cultural Heritage underscores the significance of transhumance beyond mere economic activity.  It highlights the cultural, social, and environmental aspects linked to this traditional practice, emphasizing its value for both heritage preservation and sustainable livelihoods.  This recognition serves as an example for similar initiatives worldwide.


**3. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization primarily relied on agriculture, with minimal evidence of trade and commerce with other civilizations.
2. The standardized weights and measures used in the Indus Valley Civilization indicate a sophisticated system of trade and economic organization.
3. The discovery of a dry dock in Lothal provides definitive proof of a large-scale, organized navy within the Indus Valley Civilization, capable of long-distance voyages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While agriculture was a significant aspect of the Indus Valley Civilization, archaeological evidence strongly suggests extensive trade and commerce with other civilizations.  Mesopotamian records mention trade relationships with the Indus region, indicating a well-established network of exchange of goods and resources.  The presence of imported materials further supports this assertion.

Statement 2 is correct. The use of standardized weights and measures is a crucial indicator of a developed economic system. It suggests a level of organization and planning necessary for efficient trade and commerce, pointing to a sophisticated administrative structure within the Indus Valley Civilization. This standardization facilitated fair transactions and long-distance trade.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides evidence of advanced maritime technology and knowledge of shipbuilding, it doesn't definitively prove the existence of a large-scale, organized navy capable of extensive long-distance voyages.  The dock might have served other purposes or supported smaller-scale maritime activities.  Further evidence is needed to confirm the presence of a vast naval force.


**4. With reference to the  Buddhist site of Sarnath, consider the following statements:**

1. The main temple at Sarnath is constructed in the Dravidian style of temple architecture, characterized by its tall, pyramidal towers.
2. The Vajrasana, a polished sandstone platform, marks the spot where Emperor Ashoka delivered his first sermon after attaining enlightenment.
3. The Bodhi tree at Sarnath is considered a direct descendant of the tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The main temple at Sarnath is not in the Dravidian style.  The text explicitly states that the temple's design is neither Dravida nor Nagara, although it shares characteristics with both styles.  This highlights the unique architectural blend of the Sarnath temple, differentiating it from strictly Dravidian or Nagara structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vajrasana marks the spot where Buddha sat and meditated, not where he delivered his first sermon.  The first sermon was delivered at Sarnath, but the Vajrasana specifically relates to Buddha's meditation.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the significance of this specific monument within the Sarnath complex.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Bodhi tree at Sarnath is indeed considered a direct descendant of the Bodhi tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment. This highlights the importance of the site as a place of pilgrimage and its connection to key events in Buddhist history. The lineage of the tree is a significant element of the site's religious and cultural significance.


**5. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement allows visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Pakistani Sikhs to visit religious sites on both sides of the border without any restrictions.
2. The agreement stipulates that pilgrims using the corridor must return to their country of origin on the same day, limiting extended stays.
3. Pakistan levies a fee on each pilgrim using the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, contributing to the maintenance and upkeep of the corridor infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the agreement does allow visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, it does *not* extend the same privilege to Pakistani Sikhs visiting Dera Baba Nanak in India.  They still require an Indian visa, indicating an asymmetry in the agreement's provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The agreement mandates that pilgrims using the corridor must return to their country of origin on the same day. This restriction limits the duration of their stay and is a key feature of the arrangement.  This daily return requirement is a significant aspect of the operational framework of the corridor.

Statement 3 is correct.  Pakistan does levy a fee on each pilgrim using the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. This fee is explicitly mentioned in the text and contributes to the financial aspects of maintaining and operating the corridor.  This fee is a practical element of the agreement's implementation.


**6. With reference to Megalithic sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic monument, are exclusively found in the southern parts of India, with no presence in other regions.
2. The three basic types of megaliths are chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials, encompassing a wide range of burial practices.
3.  Communities associated with megalithic sites consistently lived a sedentary life, establishing permanent settlements near their burial grounds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While dolmenoid cists are common in southern India, their presence isn't limited to that region.  Archaeological findings suggest the existence of these types of megalithic structures in other parts of India as well, demonstrating a wider geographical distribution than initially suggested.  The statement oversimplifies the geographical reach of this type of megalithic structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The three basic types of megaliths mentioned—chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials— accurately reflect the diversity of burial practices and monument types associated with megalithic cultures. This categorization encompasses the range of variations observed in megalithic sites across India.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The communities associated with megalithic sites did not consistently lead a sedentary life.  Evidence suggests that some groups practiced a semi-nomadic lifestyle, moving seasonally according to resource availability.  This mobility is reflected in the distribution of settlements and burial sites across different regions. The statement incorrectly assumes a uniform lifestyle for all megalithic cultures.


**7. With reference to the  Archaeological discoveries in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ooragutta site is known for its extensive collection of Buddhist artifacts, including stupas and viharas, showcasing a significant Buddhist presence in the region.
2. The rock art sites at Damaratogu are characterized by depictions of both humans and animals, alongside scenes of hunting and warfare, providing insights into the daily life of the region's inhabitants.
3. Devarlabanda Mula is a unique site due to the absence of human or weapon depictions in its rock art, contrasting with typical rock art found in the surrounding region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ooragutta is described as an Iron Age megalithic site, not a Buddhist site.  The description focuses on its association with megalithic culture, not Buddhism.  The statement incorrectly links Ooragutta to Buddhist artifacts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The description of Damaratogu's rock art mentions only animal depictions, not humans or scenes of hunting and warfare.  The statement adds details not present in the provided text, misrepresenting the nature of the discovered rock art.

Statement 3 is correct. Devarlabanda Mula is indeed unique for its lack of human or weapon depictions in its rock art, contrasting with the usual patterns found in the surrounding region.  This unique feature makes the site archaeologically significant, highlighting its distinct characteristics.  The statement correctly identifies this distinguishing feature of the site.


**8. With reference to the  National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under a purely government-funded initiative, without any private sector involvement.
2. The historical significance of Lothal rests primarily on its role as a major port city during the Gupta period, facilitating extensive trade with Southeast Asia.
3. The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides insights into the understanding of tides, winds, and other nautical factors that existed during the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, indicating the involvement of both government and private sectors in its development. The statement misrepresents the funding mechanism for the project.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lothal's historical significance is primarily linked to its role as a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization, not the Gupta period.  The mention of the dry dock places it firmly within the timeframe of the Indus Valley Civilization, not the Gupta period.  The statement misattributes Lothal's significance to the wrong historical era.

Statement 3 is correct. The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal does indeed provide valuable insights into the understanding of tides, winds, and other nautical factors prevalent during the Indus Valley Civilization.  This discovery highlights the advanced maritime knowledge and technology of the civilization. The statement correctly reflects the archaeological significance of the dry dock.

3. The Hathigumpha inscription, carved in Brahmi script, details Kharavela's military campaigns and provides valuable insights into his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, while a significant event, did not result in the complete annihilation of the Kalinga kingdom.  The Kalinga Dynasty continued to exist, albeit under Mauryan rule, and left a lasting cultural impact, as evidenced by its architectural and inscriptional legacy.  The statement incorrectly describes the outcome of the Kalinga War.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela is indeed known for his patronage of Jainism and the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.  These caves are a significant testament to his cultural contributions and the artistic achievements of his era.  The statement accurately reflects Kharavela's cultural patronage.

Statement 3 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription, carved in Brahmi script, is a primary source of information about Kharavela's reign and his military campaigns.  It provides valuable historical insights into his rule and the Kalinga Dynasty.  The statement accurately describes the historical significance of the Hathigumpha inscription.


**10. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra and other Buddhist Mudras, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, symbolizing fearlessness, is exclusively associated with the Buddha Shakyamuni, not other Buddhist figures.
2. The Bhumisparsha Mudra depicts Buddha calling the earth to witness his victory over Mara during his meditation.
3. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra represents the act of turning the Wheel of Dharma, symbolizing the initiation of Buddha's teachings.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra is associated with the Buddha, it's not exclusively linked to Shakyamuni.  The text mentions its association with Amoghasiddhi, another significant Buddhist figure, highlighting its broader use within Buddhist iconography.  The statement limits the mudra's association to a single figure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhumisparsha Mudra accurately depicts Buddha calling the earth to witness his victory over Mara during his meditation. This mudra is a powerful symbol within Buddhist art and iconography, illustrating a pivotal moment in Buddha's life.  The statement correctly describes the significance of this mudra.

Statement 3 is correct. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra does indeed represent the turning of the Wheel of Dharma, symbolizing the commencement of Buddha's teachings.  This mudra is central to understanding the dissemination of Buddhist doctrine and its impact on religious and cultural practices. The statement accurately identifies the meaning of this mudra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval dominance. Rajaraja I's military campaigns, detailed in historical records, involved significant naval victories against the Cheras and conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  His aggressive military policy laid the groundwork for Rajendra I's further expansion. Rajendra I's conquests extended the Chola Empire's influence across the Bay of Bengal and into Southeast Asia, significantly impacting regional trade and power dynamics.  The description of the Bay of Bengal as a "Chola lake" underscores this control. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading hub is well-documented, supporting the Chola Empire's extensive maritime trade network and their "Look East Policy" of engaging with Southeast Asian countries.  Therefore, all three statements are historically accurate.


**2. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IVC's urban planning featured a standardized grid pattern, utilizing burnt bricks and gypsum mortar, and incorporated an advanced underground drainage system.
2.  The IVC's economy relied heavily on agriculture, with major crops including wheat, rice, and barley, and the domestication of animals such as oxen, buffaloes, and sheep.
3.  The IVC lacked a sophisticated bronze-casting technology, relying primarily on stone sculptures and terracotta figurines for artistic expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The sophisticated urban planning of IVC cities, including Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, is well-documented, with the grid pattern, use of standardized bricks and mortar, and advanced drainage systems reflecting a high level of urban engineering.  Their agricultural practices, including the cultivation of various crops and domestication of animals, formed the base of their economy.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The IVC possessed advanced bronze-casting techniques, as evidenced by various artifacts, including the famous "Dancing Girl" statue. While stone sculptures and terracotta figurines were also prevalent, bronze casting represented a significant technological achievement.


**3. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda's admissions were based solely on merit, with rigorous examinations conducted by trained gatekeepers, and it boasted a vast library known as "Dharma Gunj" containing millions of books.
2.  The university received patronage from prominent rulers like King Harshavardhana and the Pala rulers, and it's believed that King Ashoka made offerings to the Chaitya of Sariputra at Nalanda.
3.  Nalanda was destroyed in 1105 AD by the Turkish general Bakhtiyar Khalji, rediscovered in the early 18th century, and later declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statements 1 and 2 correctly reflect aspects of Nalanda University.  The university's rigorous admission process, based on merit and involving examinations, is supported by historical accounts. The vast library, "Dharma Gunj," is legendary, though the exact number of books is debated.  The university's patronage by significant rulers such as Harshavardhana and the Palas is also well-established. The connection to Ashoka is a matter of historical interpretation and debate, but the traditional accounts of his involvement are significant. Statement 3 contains inaccuracies. The destruction of Nalanda occurred in 1205 AD, not 1105 AD, at the hands of Bakhtiyar Khalji.  It was rediscovered in the early 19th century, and its recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site happened in 2016.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**4. With reference to the T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The T20 World Cup, launched in 2007 by the International Cricket Council (ICC), is a premier international championship featuring a shorter format of cricket with a maximum of 20 overs per team.
2.  The ICC, headquartered in Dubai, UAE, is responsible for organizing major international cricket tournaments, including the T20 World Cup, Champions Trophy, and World Test Championship.
3. India won the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup for the third time, defeating Australia in the final held jointly in the USA and Canada.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the T20 World Cup and the role of the ICC.  The tournament's inception in 2007, its shorter format (20 overs per team), and its status as a premier international event are all correct.  The ICC's role as the global governing body for cricket and its responsibility for organizing major tournaments are also accurate. Statement 3 is incorrect on two counts.  India has only won the T20 World Cup twice (2007 and 2024), not three times and the final in 2024 was played against South Africa, not Australia, and was held in the USA and West Indies, not the USA and Canada.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.

1. The Dada Saheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in the field of cinema, presented annually to recognize outstanding contributions to Indian cinema.

(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct regarding the Dada Saheb Phalke Award. It is indeed India's highest award in cinema, recognizing lifetime contributions to the industry.  While the exact date of establishment may vary slightly depending on the source, it was instituted in the 1960s and is presented by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The list of notable recipients mentioned includes prominent figures who have received the award.  Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect information about the Dada Saheb Phalke Award.


**6. With reference to the  Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register is an initiative of UNESCO launched in 1992 to preserve and promote significant documentary heritage from the Asia-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the Memory of the World (MOW) program and its Asia-Pacific Regional Register. UNESCO's MOW initiative, launched in 1992, aims to preserve and promote documentary heritage worldwide.  The Asia-Pacific Regional Register is part of this larger initiative, focusing specifically on the Asia-Pacific region.  The inclusion of the mentioned Indian literary works in this register is also accurate. The MOW program's structure, with its International, Regional, and National registers, is also correctly stated. Therefore, all three statements correctly reflect aspects of the MOW program.


**7. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is the seasonal movement of livestock, often involving the migration of human communities along with their herds, between different pastures based on seasonal availability.
2. In 2023, two transhumance traditions—one from 10 European states and another from Switzerland—were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.
3. In India, transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayas, with nomadic tribes such as Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas driving their herds to subalpine and alpine pastures in summer and to adjoining plains in winter.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately describe transhumance.  The definition of transhumance as the seasonal movement of livestock, often accompanied by human communities, is correct.  The description of transhumance practices in the Himalayas, involving specific nomadic tribes and their seasonal movements, is also accurate.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UNESCO recognition of transhumance traditions did occur in 2023, it was not specifically of two traditions — one from 10 European states and another from Switzerland —  but rather two distinct traditions, one encompassing multiple European states and another specifically from Switzerland.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct.  The phrasing in statement 2 leads to a misunderstanding.


**8. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1. Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has been renamed Sri Vijaya Puram to commemorate the victory of the Indian freedom movement and highlight the islands' unique contribution.
2.  The renaming signifies a departure from colonial legacy, emphasizing the contemporary strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, historically significant as a naval base for the Chola Empire.
3. The Cellular Jail, a significant historical landmark associated with India's struggle for independence, is located in what was formerly known as Port Blair (now Sri Vijaya Puram).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the context surrounding the renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram. The renaming is intended to commemorate the Indian freedom struggle and highlight the islands' historical significance.  The move also represents a symbolic shift away from colonial nomenclature, emphasizing the contemporary strategic importance of the islands.  The Cellular Jail's presence in Sri Vijaya Puram (formerly Port Blair) further reinforces the historical and national importance of the location.  Thus, all three statements correctly capture the essence of this event.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victories significantly expanded Chola control over the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.
2.  The Chola navy's conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I led to the island's complete annexation as a Chola province.
3.  Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center for the Chola Empire, primarily dealing in textiles and spices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajaraja I's naval dominance in the Bay of Bengal was instrumental in establishing Chola power and trade links with Southeast Asia. His victories, such as the destruction of the Chera navy, solidified this control, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake."  This facilitated the flourishing of trade, showcasing the empire's maritime prowess and economic influence.

Statement 2 is also correct. Rajendra I's successful naval campaigns culminated in the complete conquest and annexation of Sri Lanka as a Chola province. This expansion underscored the Chola Empire's military strength and its ability to project power across maritime territories.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Nagapattinam was indeed a significant trading center for the Chola Empire, its trade wasn't primarily focused on textiles and spices.  The Chola maritime trade encompassed a diverse range of goods, including spices, but also precious stones, pearls, and other luxury items.  The statement oversimplifies the complexity of Chola trade.  The focus on textiles is a misdirection.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is exclusively practiced in mountainous regions, with nomadic communities moving their livestock seasonally between high-altitude pastures and lowlands.
2.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses solely on European transhumance traditions.
3.  In India, transhumance is primarily associated with pastoral communities in the Himalayas, such as the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in mountainous regions, it's not exclusively limited to them.  The practice also exists in plains regions of India, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement presents a geographically restrictive and inaccurate view.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, although initiated with a focus on European traditions (as evidenced by the 2023 declaration of two European traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages), aims to encompass and protect transhumance practices globally. The statement unduly limits the initiative's scope.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the prevalence of transhumance in the Himalayas among several nomadic tribes, including Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, who move their sheep and goats between summer and winter pastures.  This accurately reflects a significant aspect of Indian transhumance.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only one global register for documentary heritage.
2.  The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, included manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3.  The inclusion of these three Indian literary works in the register signifies their exceptional historical and cultural significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. The statement incorrectly simplifies the structure of the program's record-keeping.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that the 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, included the manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Statement 3 is correct. The inclusion of these works in the prestigious MoW register undeniably reflects their significant historical and cultural value.  Their inclusion underscores their importance in preserving and promoting India's literary heritage on a global platform.

3. The areas beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for approximately six months during the Summer Solstice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Summer Solstice marks the longest day and shortest night in the *Northern* Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, it's the winter solstice, experiencing the shortest day and longest night. The statement confuses the hemispheric effects of the solstice.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that on the Summer Solstice, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, and the sun's rays fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text clearly indicates that locations beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for approximately six months around the Summer Solstice due to the Earth's axial tilt.


**5. With reference to the Flag Code of India, 2002, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2022 amendment to the Flag Code of India permits the display of the National Flag only during specific national holidays.
2. The Flag Code governs the display of the National Flag by both private and government entities.
3.  The 2021 amendment to the Flag Code mandates that the National Flag must be made exclusively of hand-spun and hand-woven cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 2022 amendment actually allows the display of the National Flag on all days and nights, expanding its permissible usage beyond just national holidays. The statement misrepresents the amendment's impact.

Statement 2 is correct. The Flag Code explicitly governs the display of the National Flag by both private citizens and organizations, as well as government institutions, ensuring consistent and respectful usage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 2021 amendment did allow for machine-made flags, it does *not* restrict the material exclusively to hand-spun and hand-woven cotton.  It allows for cotton, polyester, wool, silk, or Ichadi bunting. The statement presents an overly restrictive and inaccurate interpretation of the amendment.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. National Handloom Day is indeed celebrated annually on August 7th to honor handloom weavers and highlight the importance of the handloom industry.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of National Handloom Day is to recognize the contributions of handloom weavers and provide support and encouragement to the industry.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While export promotion might be a secondary aspect, the core focus of National Handloom Day is on acknowledging the weavers, preserving traditional techniques, and supporting the domestic handloom sector.  The statement overemphasizes the export aspect, misrepresenting the day's central goals.


**7. With reference to the T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, launched the T20 World Cup in 2007.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The renaming is not focused on the British Raj but on the Indian freedom struggle and the contemporary strategic significance of the islands.  The statement misinterprets the rationale behind the name change.

Statement 2 is correct. The new name, Sri Vijaya Puram, directly references the Indian freedom movement and the islands' role in it, particularly Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's activities there.

Statement 3 is correct.  The renaming is explicitly presented as a move away from colonial nomenclature, emphasizing the islands' current strategic importance.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the celestial realm, not his first sermon at Sarnath. The statement conflates two distinct events in Buddhist history.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the Ministry of Culture, along with the IBC, observed IAD.

Statement 3 is correct.  The observation of IAD coincided with the celebration of Pali's declaration as a classical language.

(b) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions Ruskin Bond as a recent recipient of the Fellowship.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the Fellowship is the highest honor bestowed by the Sahitya Akademi.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The primary aim of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project is to create a well-connected pathway from the temple to the Ganges river.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the newly announced corridor projects for Vishnupad and Mahabodhi Temples are *inspired* by the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, not the other way around.  The statement reverses the inspiration.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the carvings were found on *meta basalt* rock, not granite, along the dry riverbed.  The statement contains a factual error regarding the rock type.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat leverages blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of its premium cotton, enhancing its credibility in the global market.  Statement 2 is also correct; the initiative's core aim is to improve the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through self-regulation and a sustainable approach, managed collaboratively by various stakeholders.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the primary implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.  The involvement of multiple stakeholders, including trade bodies and industry players, highlights a collaborative approach to achieving the project's objectives.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Its focus is on domestic art promotion and not solely on global outreach. Statement 2 accurately describes the project's implementation through the collaboration of Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, with a clear emphasis on public art installations to transform urban landscapes. Statement 3 is false. While Project PARI does include traditional art forms, it showcases a diverse range of Indian art, encompassing various regional styles, not limited to South India.

This highlights the broader geographic scope of transhumance.  Statement 3 is also incorrect because it falsely claims that transhumance is absent in the Indian plains.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative and its global and Indian contexts.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja I did have significant naval victories, the text specifically mentions the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. The Pandya kingdom was a rival, but the text doesn't directly link this specific battle to weakening the Pandya navy to the extent of establishing Chola dominance.  The question plays on the close geographical proximity and rivalry between the Cholas and Pandyas to create confusion.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's expeditions are explicitly described as extending Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, directly supporting the statement.  The establishment of trade routes is a logical consequence of this territorial expansion.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the Chola control over the Bay of Bengal fostered trade with Southeast Asia, and Nagapattinam's role as a major trading center is highlighted.


**2. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja I had significant naval victories, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai.  This is a crucial detail that distinguishes the accuracy of the statement. The Pandya and Chera were distinct kingdoms.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province. This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Chola expansion.

Statement 3 is correct. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading center facilitating trade with Southeast Asia is clearly mentioned in the text, showcasing the Chola Empire's economic prowess and strategic maritime policies.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative did declare two European transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages, it is not limited to Europe. The statement falsely restricts the scope of the initiative.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The text highlights the prevalence of transhumance in the Himalayas among the mentioned tribes. However, to be precise, it’s not *primarily* limited to the Himalayas.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the existence of transhumance in various plains regions of India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the geographical spread of this practice in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The discovery of standardized weights and measures in various Indus Valley Civilization sites points to a well-organized system of trade, both within the civilization and with external regions.  The uniformity suggests centralized control and efficient distribution networks.  Archaeological evidence supports the existence of extensive trade routes connecting the Indus Valley Civilization with Mesopotamia and other regions.

Statement 2 is correct. Lothal is renowned for its well-preserved dockyard, a testament to the advanced understanding of shipbuilding, navigation, and maritime engineering possessed by the Indus people. The construction of such a structure requires sophisticated knowledge of tides, winds, and other nautical factors. This finding offers crucial insights into their maritime capabilities and trade networks.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Indus Valley Civilization did possess a unique pictographic script written in boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), it remains undeciphered to this day.  The lack of decipherment prevents a complete understanding of their societal structure, religious beliefs, and daily lives, though significant progress in understanding the script through comparative analysis is being made.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 2 is correct.  Phanigiri's archaeological excavations have unearthed a wealth of evidence indicating the presence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist traditions. The coexistence of these sects is a significant aspect of the site's historical and religious importance. The time period mentioned is also accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ratnagiri site in Odisha is indeed part of the "Diamond Triangle," along with Lalitagiri and Udayagiri, representing a significant cluster of Buddhist centers known for their prominence in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.  Their academic standing and historical significance are undeniable.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  The  description emphasizes their partially buried nature, a key differentiating feature from other megalithic structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and those unconnected with burials, demonstrating the diversity of megalithic burial practices.  This reflects the archaeological understanding of the varied forms and functions of megalithic structures across India.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage directly states that certain tribal groups in India lived a semi-nomadic life and avoided permanent settlement within defined reserve forests. This highlights the relationship between mobility, land use patterns, and the socio-cultural practices of these groups. The statement accurately reflects this aspect of their history.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Phanigiri is located in Telangana, its significance lies in its Buddhist, not Hindu, remains. The site features a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, and viharas, characteristic of Buddhist monastic complexes. The mention of the Ikshvaku period further confirms its Buddhist association.  The Gupta period is not directly associated with Phanigiri's primary archaeological findings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the thorana panels at Phanigiri show evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects coexisting at the site. This indicates a rich and complex religious landscape, contradicting the statement's claim of exclusive Hinayana influence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the unearthed coin hoard at Phanigiri belongs to the Ikshvaku period.  This directly refutes the claim that the hoard predates the Ikshvaku era.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bavikonda Monastery is located near Visakhapatnam, not Vijayawada.  Vijayawada is known for its own distinct historical and architectural significance, but it is geographically distant from Bavikonda.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clarifies that "Bavikonda" means "hill of wells," referring to the historical presence of wells used for rainwater storage, not caves. The name is directly linked to this water resource feature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that Bavikonda is a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, containing structures like a Mahastupa and Acharya Vihara, typical of this tradition.  The statement's assertion of primarily Mahayana elements is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that there is no term "missing monuments" in the AMASR Act. The term was used by the CAG audit team, not the Act itself.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly lists Kos Minar No. 13 in Haryana among the monuments considered for delisting by the ASI due to being "untraceable" and lacking national importance.

The other options are therefore incorrect because they include the inaccurate Statement 3.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Rajendra I's extensive naval expeditions significantly impacted the Sailendra Empire, leading to the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This expansion of Chola power highlights their naval prowess and ambition.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nagapattinam's strategic location and well-developed infrastructure made it a vital hub for the Chola Empire's maritime trade. Its role in connecting the Chola Empire with Southeast Asia is well-documented.

Statement 3 is partially correct in that the Chola's dominance in the Bay of Bengal facilitated trade with Southeast Asia, and their "Look East Policy" focused on this region. However, attributing the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai *solely* to this broader dominance is an oversimplification. While the Chola naval strength undoubtedly played a role, the specific battle at Kandalursalai may have had other contributing factors. The source mentions Rajaraja's role in this battle, indicating a more direct connection than a general statement of naval dominance implies.  Therefore, the statement is inaccurate in its direct causal link.

Statement 1 is largely correct. While transhumance exists in other parts of India, the Himalayan region is prominently associated with this traditional practice, involving the mentioned nomadic communities.  The statement accurately reflects the significant presence of transhumance in the Himalayas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the transhumance system also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement contradicts this information.

Statement 3 is correct. The inclusion of European transhumance traditions in the UNESCO list underscores the global recognition and importance of this practice.  This highlights its cultural and historical significance beyond a specific geographical area.

Statement 2 is also correct. The description of the calendar's symbols and their potential meanings is accurately reflected in the statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in describing Vivekananda's philosophical contributions. However, the assertion that he is considered "the rock where Goddess Kanyakumari prayed to Lord Shiva" is entirely unrelated to his life and teachings and is factually incorrect.  This addition makes the entire statement false.

Statement 2 is correct.  It accurately describes his influential address in Chicago and the founding of the Ramakrishna Mission.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While the GI tag system protects product identity and quality,  the statement that it does *not* provide financial benefits is debatable.  The increased market value and brand recognition associated with a GI tag can indirectly lead to financial benefits for producers. The statement is inaccurate because it overlooks the potential economic benefits.

Statement 3 is incorrect. GI tag systems, or similar systems for protecting geographical indications, exist in many countries worldwide, not just India. The statement makes an inaccurate global claim.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may focus more on factual recall than complex analysis, as the text primarily presents factual information.  However,  distractors have been carefully crafted to test the candidate's ability to discriminate between closely related but incorrect information.

3.  The handloom sector in India employs a majority of male workers, contributing significantly to the national economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the historical context and purpose of National Handloom Day.  The Swadeshi Movement, launched on August 7th, 1905, played a crucial role in highlighting the importance of Indian-made goods, including handloom textiles.  The annual celebration of National Handloom Day on August 7th aims to honor handloom weavers and boost the industry.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the handloom sector is a significant employer, a majority of its workers are women, not men. This fact highlights the gendered nature of labor within this traditional industry, a crucial detail often overlooked.  The incorrect data in statement 3 serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the sector's demographics.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is not produced by *Bombyx mori*, the silkworm that produces mulberry silk.  Instead, it's produced by *Philosamia ricini*. This subtle difference tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of different silk types and their respective silkworms. Statement 2 is correct; Oeko-Tex certification ensures environmentally sound production practices. Statement 3 is also correct; the unique characteristic of Eri silk is the non-lethal harvesting of the silk, making it a "vegan" silk.  The inclusion of a factually incorrect statement about the silkworm species effectively functions as a distractor, challenging the candidate's precise understanding of Eri silk production.


**3. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) None
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect because Denisovans coexisted and interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans. Statement 2 is false as genetic evidence strongly suggests interbreeding with both Neanderthals and modern humans.  Statement 3 is wrong; Denisovan remains have been found in Asia, not primarily in Africa. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the complex evolutionary relationships between different hominid species, using deliberately misleading information to increase difficulty. The use of "primarily" in statement 3 is a subtle attempt to mislead the examinee.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Rajaraja Chola I's naval power extended beyond the eastern coast of India. Statement 2 is correct; Rajendra Chola I's conquests reached Southeast Asia. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Chola navy's influence extended significantly into the Indian Ocean and beyond. The question challenges the candidate's knowledge of the geographical extent of Chola naval power, employing subtle inaccuracies to create plausible distractors.  The scope of Chola naval reach is not always clearly understood by candidates, making this a challenging question.

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Ahom Dynasty's origins, administrative structure, and cultural impact, using incorrect statements about the king's power and the scope of cultural influence to increase the difficulty level. The nuanced understanding of the dynasty's political and cultural impact is often not fully appreciated.

Statement 3 is incorrect; Kozhikode was ruled by the Zamorins (Samoothiris), not the Vijayanagara Empire. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Kozhikode's historical significance and etymology, using an incorrect statement about the ruling dynasty to increase the difficulty. The specific details of the city's rulers during the medieval period are often not fully known.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the earliest period and subject matter of the paintings. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while hunting scenes and dances are depicted, humans are portrayed in a *stylistic*, not naturalistic manner. Statement 3 is incorrect; Neolithic-Chalcolithic paintings show a decline in vividness and detail, not an increase. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the stylistic evolution of prehistoric rock paintings across different periods, using incorrect statements about the styles and color palettes to increase the difficulty. The nuanced differences in artistic styles across different periods are often not fully appreciated.

Statement 2 is incorrect; India's involvement was multifaceted, including diplomatic efforts, financial aid, and providing a platform for anti-apartheid activists.

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's role in the anti-apartheid movement and the UN's actions, using incorrect statements about the scope of India's involvement and the UN's role to increase the difficulty level. The detailed understanding of both India's and the UN's actions is often not fully appreciated.



**1. With reference to the illicit trafficking of antiquities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, in its entirety, prohibits the export of all antiquities from India.
2. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is solely responsible for the global coordination and recovery of all stolen Indian antiquities.
3. The Kashi Culture Pathway, a G20 initiative, aims to establish a global coalition to combat illicit trafficking but excludes repatriation efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, prevents the export of antiquities, the act does not cover all aspects of  antiquity protection and control.  The act has several provisions and doesn't solely focus on export.  There are other regulations and laws concerning the protection and preservation of antiquities within India.

Statement 2 is incorrect as the ASI coordinates and recovers antiquities within India. International cooperation involves multiple agencies and international treaties, making the ASI’s role less absolute. The recovery of stolen antiquities often involves international collaboration and legal processes beyond the ASI’s direct control.

Statement 3 is incorrect because the Kashi Culture Pathway aims to bolster the fight against illicit trafficking, including aspects of prevention,  investigation, and potentially even repatriation. It's not limited to just one aspect of the issue.


**2. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The IYD was first celebrated in 2015, coinciding with the summer solstice.
2.  The proposal for IYD was initiated by China and subsequently endorsed by the UN.
3. Yoga, as a practice, is explicitly mentioned in all ancient Indian philosophical schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014; however, the first celebration took place in 2015.  The date aligns with the summer solstice, but the statement incorrectly states the year of the first celebration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India proposed the draft resolution for IYD, not China, and it gained record support from 175 member states. The initiative was strongly rooted in India's cultural heritage and diplomatic efforts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Yoga is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, not all six.  While evidence suggests its ancient origins, explicit mention in *all* schools isn't supported by historical evidence.  The text only mentions that it is one of the six schools, not all six.


**3. With reference to Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. Abhaya mudra symbolizes enlightenment and spiritual awakening.
2.  The Bhumisparsha mudra depicts Buddha's defeat of Mara.
3.  Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Dhyani Buddha, is exclusively associated with the Dhyana mudra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Abhaya mudra primarily symbolizes fearlessness, protection, and reassurance, not enlightenment, although it can be associated with a sense of peace and security that may contribute to spiritual well-being.  The statement conflates the mudra's core meaning with a broader spiritual interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhumisparsha mudra, also known as the earth-touching mudra, depicts the moment when Buddha called upon the earth to witness his victory over Mara, the personification of evil and temptation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Amoghasiddhi is associated with Abhaya mudra, it is not exclusively linked to it.  The Dhyani Buddhas are associated with various mudras, and attributing one mudra solely to one Buddha is an oversimplification.


**4. With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the US, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA primarily focuses on facilitating the return of Indian antiquities currently held in private collections within the USA.
2. The agreement was signed during the 45th World Heritage Committee meeting.
3. The CPA restricts the importation of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin into the USA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPA aims to prevent and curb illicit trafficking, its primary focus is not solely on repatriation of antiquities already in private hands.  The agreement focuses on preventing future illicit import, not necessarily on retrieving past acquisitions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the 46th World Heritage Committee meeting, not the 45th.  The specific meeting context is important for understanding the diplomatic setting of the agreement.

Statement 3 is correct. The CPA directly addresses the restriction of the import of specified archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin into the United States, aiming to prevent the entry of illegally obtained artifacts.


**5. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval conquests extended to Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajendra Chola I led expeditions to Southeast Asia,  Rajaraja Chola I's major naval conquests primarily focused on Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia, but not to the extent described in statement 1.  The statement overstates the scope of Rajaraja's conquests.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chola victory at Kandalursalai was a significant naval triumph that weakened the Chera naval power, altering the power dynamics in South India.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While Rajendra Chola I conquered Sri Lanka, the island's status as a Chola province wasn't permanent.  The statement oversimplifies the complex political dynamics and doesn't account for periods of Sri Lankan independence.


**6. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a traditional practice primarily limited to the Himalayan region of India.
2.  Two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it's also practiced in other parts of India, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, as mentioned in the source. The statement incorrectly limits the geographic scope of the practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023, not 2022.  The specific year is a factual detail.

Statement 3 is correct. The core definition of transhumance includes the seasonal movement of both livestock and the human communities that tend them, reflecting a close relationship between pastoralism and human settlement patterns.


**7. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The three Indian literary works were included in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register, not the International Register. The distinction between regional and international registers is crucial for understanding the scope of the recognition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  The location of the meeting is a specific factual detail.

Statement 3 is correct. The MOW program's core objectives include preserving documentary heritage worldwide, ensuring access to this heritage, and raising public awareness about its importance.

1.  The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to multiple writers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is not awarded annually to multiple writers; it's a prestigious award given to a select few writers, not on an annual basis.  The frequency of the award is a crucial factual detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ruskin Bond received the Fellowship while he was still alive.  The timing of the award is a factual detail.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is indeed the highest honor conferred by the Akademi on writers, recognizing their significant contributions to Indian literature.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree.

3. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observed IAD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Sankassiya, not his attainment of enlightenment.  The event commemorated is specific.

Statement 2 is correct. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya is indeed linked to the event commemorated by IAD. The pillar's location and historical significance are key facts.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in conjunction with the IBC, did observe IAD. The collaboration between these organizations is a factual detail.


**10. With reference to Megaliths, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists are above-ground chamber tombs.
2.  Megaliths are exclusively associated with burial practices.
3.  The people associated with megaliths lived a completely nomadic life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are semi-subterranean chamber tombs, not above-ground. The location of the tombs is a factual detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many megaliths are associated with burials, not all are.  Some megaliths served other purposes, making the statement an overgeneralization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The people associated with megaliths lived a semi-nomadic life, not a completely nomadic life.  The degree of nomadism is a factual detail.  The text mentions that they lived a *semi*-nomadic life.


**1. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna award was initially conferred posthumously.
2.  The design of the Bharat Ratna medal incorporates the state emblem on its reverse side.
3.  Sachin Tendulkar was the first sportsperson to be awarded the Bharat Ratna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Initially, the Bharat Ratna was *not* conferred posthumously; this practice began in 1966.  Statement 2 is correct. The reverse side of the Bharat Ratna medal features the phrase "Satyameva Jayate" under the state emblem. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sachin Tendulkar was the youngest recipient and the first sportsperson to receive the award, he was not the first sportsperson overall.  The question cleverly uses the phrase "first sportsperson" to create ambiguity, as it could be interpreted in two ways: the first sportsperson ever to receive the award or the first in a chronological order among other sportspersons.  The former is incorrect, whereas the latter can be considered true if we consider the timeline of the awards, though not explicitly stated in the source.  The correct option highlights the precise detail about the medal's reverse design, a fact that requires precise recall and isn't easily inferred.


**2. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Film Awards were initially known as "State Awards" and were instituted in 1955.
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1974.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1955, and were initially called "State Awards." Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directorate of Film Festivals began administering the awards in 1973, not 1974.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  There are only three categories mentioned in the source: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema.  The "Best Regional Film" award is not explicitly mentioned as a separate category; the awards for regional films are mentioned under the broader award categories. The question effectively tests detailed factual recall regarding the precise years and the number of award categories, preventing easy guessing.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles Award includes a monetary grant for winning projects.
2. The Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru, won the 2023 Prix Versailles Award in the Airports category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The source explicitly states that the award does *not* include any monetary grant. Statement 2 is correct. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the 2023 award. Statement 3 is correct. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was shortlisted, though it is not stated that it won the award. The question cleverly uses the fact that a shortlisted entry may or may not win the award, creating a plausible distractor. The correct option focuses on the accurate information about the Bengaluru airport's win.

1. The Olympic Games were first held in 1896 in Rome.
2. The Olympic flag features five interlocking rings, symbolizing the five continents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, not Rome, in 1896.  Statement 2 is correct. The five interlocking rings represent the five continents. Statement 3 is incorrect. The CAS was established in 1983, not 1984.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The wartime gallantry awards (Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950, not 1951. Statement 2 is correct. The Ashoka Chakra Class-II was renamed Kirti Chakra in 1967. Statement 3 is incorrect. Peacetime Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year—on Republic Day and Independence Day. The question plays on the close proximity of years and the frequency of award announcements, requiring accurate recall of specific details.


**6. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1955.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order.
3.  The Padma Awards are normally not conferred posthumously, except in rare cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, not 1955. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, not just distinguished service of a high order (that's Padma Bhushan). Statement 3 is correct. The awards are typically not given posthumously but can be in exceptional circumstances.  The question uses the subtle difference in the descriptions of award categories and the exception clause to create confusion, demanding precise understanding of the award criteria.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IOA was formed in 1927 and recognized by the IOC in the same year. Statement 2 is correct.  Sir Dorabji Tata was the first President. Statement 3 is incorrect. India aims to be among the top ten sports nations by 2036, not top five by 2047 (although it does aim for top five by 2047, but that is not related to the olympic ranking). The question uses the year and the ranking targets to create plausible but incorrect options, requiring precise factual recall about the IOA's formation and leadership.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first CWG was held in Hamilton, Canada, not London. Statement 2 is incorrect. India hosted the CWG in 2010 in Delhi, not Mumbai. Statement 3 is correct. Six sports were dropped from the 2026 edition. The question uses incorrect locations and years to create distractors, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of CWG history.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

Statement 2 is correct. The awards are based on experiences shared by retiring employees. Statement 3 is correct. The aim is to use the retiring employees' experience to improve governance. The question uses a similar-sounding ministry to create confusion, requiring specific knowledge of the awarding department.

1. The 45th Chess Olympiad was held in Chennai, India.
2. The Indian contingent won gold medals in both the open and women's categories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 45th Chess Olympiad was held in Budapest, Hungary; the 44th was in Chennai. Statement 2 is correct.  India won gold in both categories. Statement 3 is correct. The Hamilton-Russell Cup is the trophy for the open section winner.  The question uses the location and the Olympiad number to create distractors, needing specific knowledge of the event's details.

1. The Saluva dynasty succeeded the Sangama dynasty, marking a period of relative decline in the empire's power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Saluva dynasty did indeed succeed the Sangama dynasty, and while the empire didn't completely collapse, it did experience a period of relative instability and decline before the rise of the more powerful Tuluva dynasty.  Statement 2 is also correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is widely considered a high point of the Vijayanagara Empire, marked by significant territorial expansion and military successes as described. Statement 3 is incorrect. While Amara Nayakas controlled 'Amaram' and 'Bhandaravada' lands, they didn't directly cultivate them.  They employed Kaniyalars for this purpose, indicating a system of tenant farming rather than direct cultivation by the Nayakas themselves. The Amara Nayaka system was a crucial aspect of the Vijayanagara administration, highlighting a decentralized power structure where regional lords were granted considerable autonomy in managing their territories.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did strengthen Chola control over the Coromandel Coast, his naval expeditions were far more ambitious, extending to Sri Lanka and significantly impacting the maritime balance of power in the Indian Ocean.  Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's reign is renowned for his extensive naval conquests, reaching as far as the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia, demonstrating the reach and power of the Chola navy. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chola navy's influence extended beyond the Bay of Bengal. Their naval power projected into the Indian Ocean, significantly impacting trade routes and political dynamics in the region.  The Chola naval expeditions were a testament to their advanced shipbuilding technology, sophisticated naval strategy, and effective logistical capabilities.  Their campaigns significantly shaped the political landscape of Southeast Asia and left a lasting impact on maritime history.

The Vaikom Satyagraha's central aim was to challenge the discriminatory practice of barring lower-caste Hindus from accessing certain public thoroughfares leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.  This was a critical step towards dismantling the caste system's rigid social hierarchies. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gandhi's direct involvement was limited, his support and endorsement played a significant role in galvanizing national attention to the movement. His participation, though not constant, significantly boosted the movement's credibility and momentum. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha witnessed internal disagreements and differing perspectives among its leaders, particularly regarding the movement's broader goals and strategies.  The involvement of figures like E.V. Ramasamy Periyar, who had his own independent approach to social reform, adds complexity to this narrative.  The movement was not a monolithic entity.


**4. With reference to the  Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles without collaboration from other stakeholders.
2. The use of blockchain technology ensures complete traceability and certification of Kasturi cotton, enhancing its global competitiveness.

Blockchain technology is a core component of the initiative, providing a transparent and secure system for tracking the cotton's journey from farm to market. This enhances trust and confidence among consumers and international buyers.  Statement 3 is not explicitly stated in the provided text. While the initiative aims to enhance the competitiveness of Indian cotton, the primary focus appears to be on quality, traceability, and branding rather than achieving complete self-sufficiency in cotton production.  The initiative's success hinges on the effective implementation of its strategies for improving quality, traceability, and branding to secure a larger market share in the global cotton trade.


**5. With reference to the Project PARI initiative, consider the following statements:**

This collaboration is essential for leveraging the expertise and resources of both institutions in executing the project effectively. Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary focus of Project PARI is to enhance urban landscapes through public art installations, creating accessible art spaces in cities. While the project may have future expansions to rural areas, the initial focus remains on urban spaces. Statement 3 is correct. Project PARI explicitly incorporates a range of Indian art forms, including Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, and others, reflecting India's rich artistic diversity.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological findings suggest that practices related to Yoga were prevalent in ancient India, with evidence found in Indus Valley Civilization artifacts.  Statement 3 is correct. While Yoga's origins are ancient, Patanjali's Yogasutra provides the earliest known systematic compilation of Yoga principles and practices. The declaration of International Yoga Day reflects the global recognition of Yoga's benefits and its cultural significance.  The day promotes physical and mental well-being and fosters cross-cultural understanding.

This recognition highlights the importance of these works in preserving cultural and intellectual heritage. Statement 3 is incorrect. The MOW program maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  This tiered system helps to organize and manage the vast amount of documentary heritage across different geographical regions and levels. The inclusion of these Indian texts in the MOW Asia-Pacific register reflects the global importance of these works and the efforts to preserve them for future generations.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru, was indeed honored with the UNESCO’s 2023 Prix Versailles award, recognizing it as one of the world's most beautiful airports.  This award specifically highlights architectural design and integration with the environment.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Prix Versailles award focuses on the architectural merit of buildings and their contribution to improving the surrounding environment, which aligns with the airport's design and integration into the landscape.  The award implicitly acknowledges the positive impact on the living environment through aesthetic enhancement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The award was received in December 2023, not November 2023. This is a crucial detail that demonstrates the need for precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  A seemingly minor date discrepancy can significantly impact the accuracy of an answer.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between related but ultimately incorrect information.  The inclusion of this incorrect detail serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to evaluate information critically.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the museum does commemorate the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and is located in Bhuj, the magnitude of the earthquake was 7.9, not 8.9 on the Richter scale. This incorrect magnitude serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical data. The question tests not only knowledge of the museum but also the accurate details of the associated earthquake.


Statement 2 is correct. The museum does indeed feature one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, a testament to sustainable practices and the application of the Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki's method.  This aspect of the museum demonstrates an understanding of environmental initiatives and their integration into memorial projects.


Statement 3 is correct. The museum's location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, which also houses a fort built in 1723, provides historical context and showcases the integration of the memorial within a larger historical site.  This demonstrates an understanding of the interplay between modern memorials and historical locations.


The question effectively tests the candidate's ability to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate details, requiring a high level of factual recall and analytical skill to identify the correct combination of statements.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect information enhances the question's difficulty level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts: the award was instituted in 1969, not 1970, and it is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  This statement contains two inaccuracies, increasing the difficulty and testing the candidate's ability to identify subtle errors.  The details of the year of institution and the presenting body are easily confused, making this a strong distractor.


Statement 2 is correct.  The award does include a Golden Lotus medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ₹10 lakhs. This demonstrates factual recall of the award's components.


Statement 3 is correct. Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, and Waheeda Rehman are indeed notable recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, showcasing an understanding of the award's history and its recipients.


The question successfully tests the candidate's ability to identify and differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information, requiring precise factual recall and a strong understanding of the award's details. The combined inaccuracies in statement 1 and the correct information in statements 2 and 3 make this a challenging and effective UPSC-style question.


**4. With reference to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, consider the following statements:**

1.  It primarily aims to connect the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the Yamuna River.
2.  The project involved the restoration of several smaller temples, including the Sheetla Mata Temple and Shri Ram Temple.
3.  The Economic Survey 2023-24 reported that India earned over ₹2.3 lakh crore in foreign exchange from tourism, a 65.7% increase year-on-year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor connects the temple to the banks of the Ganges River, not the Yamuna River. This incorrect river name is a strong distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of Indian geography and the project's specific location.


Statement 2 is correct. The project did indeed involve the restoration and preservation of several smaller temples in the vicinity of the main temple, including the Sheetla Mata Temple and Shri Ram Temple. This demonstrates an understanding of the project's broader impact on the preservation of cultural heritage.


Statement 3 is correct. The Economic Survey 2023-24 did report the mentioned figures for foreign exchange earnings from tourism.  While seemingly unrelated at first glance, including this statement tests the candidate’s ability to make interdisciplinary connections between economic indicators and cultural/infrastructure projects.  The inclusion of this seemingly unrelated economic statistic adds complexity and tests the candidate's ability to synthesize information from different sources.


The question's difficulty is enhanced by the inclusion of a geographically incorrect detail in statement 1, which requires a high degree of precision in recalling the project details.  The seemingly tangential economic data in statement 3 further increases the challenge, demanding a deeper understanding of the context and impact of the project.


**5. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  It flourished primarily between 4000 BCE and 1500 BCE, spanning across sites in present-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, though the timeline is slightly off. A more accurate timeframe would be 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. The slight inaccuracy in the dates serves as a distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge, even within a range.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the civilization's overall duration, not just the precise start and end dates.


Statement 2 is correct. The Indus Valley Civilization is renowned for its advanced urban planning, featuring a grid pattern, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized brick sizes. This highlights the understanding of the civilization's technological achievements.


Statement 3 is incorrect. Iron was not known to the Indus Valley Civilization.  The use of iron tools and weaponry was a hallmark of later periods in Indian history. This incorrect statement acts as a potent distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the technological limitations of the civilization.


The inclusion of a slightly inaccurate timeframe in statement 1 and the starkly incorrect statement about iron technology in statement 3 significantly increases the difficulty of the question.  The candidate needs to know not only the general characteristics but also the specific technological limitations of the civilization to answer correctly.  This question effectively tests both factual recall and the ability to identify incorrect information, which is crucial for UPSC-level examination.


**6. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut), consider the following statements:**

1.  It was a significant center for the spice trade, interacting with various cultures, including Arabs, Jews, and Chinese, for over 600 years.
2.  Ibn Battuta, Vasco da Gama, and Abdur Razzaq are among the foreign travelers who visited the city during the 15th and 16th centuries.
3.  In 2012, Kozhikode was designated as a "City of Literature" by UNESCO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Kozhikode was indeed a major spice trading center, interacting with a vast array of cultures for centuries. However, the duration is slightly exaggerated.  The slight inaccuracy serves as a distractor; the focus is on the historical significance of the city's role in spice trade, not the precise duration.


Statement 2 is correct.  Ibn Battuta, Vasco da Gama, and Abdur Razzaq are all well-documented travelers who visited Kozhikode during the relevant period. This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical figures and their travels.


Statement 3 is incorrect. While Kozhikode has a rich literary tradition and was declared a "City of Literature" by the Kerala government, it has not received this designation from UNESCO. This incorrect statement is a crucial distractor.  The question tests not only the city's history but also the ability to differentiate between government declarations and UNESCO recognitions.


The inclusion of a slightly inaccurate timeline in statement 1 and the completely incorrect information in statement 3 increases the question's difficulty significantly.  The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of historical events, historical figures, and the nuances of cultural designations.


**7.  With reference to government initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a Ministry of Textiles initiative that utilizes blockchain technology for traceability and certification of Indian cotton.
2.  Project PARI, executed by Lalit Kala Akademi, aims to promote art through public installations in rural landscapes.
3.  The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is a Ministry of Tourism program focusing on responsible tourism across 50 tourist destinations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a Ministry of Textiles initiative that leverages blockchain technology to ensure traceability and certification of high-quality Indian cotton. This statement showcases knowledge of government initiatives in the textile sector and the application of technology in supply chain management.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Project PARI does aim to promote art through public installations, it focuses on *urban* landscapes, not rural ones.  This subtle difference is a key distractor; it tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the program's scope and target areas.


Statement 3 is correct.  The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is indeed a Ministry of Tourism program aimed at promoting responsible tourism in 50 select tourist destinations. This tests the candidate's awareness of government initiatives in the tourism sector.


The question's difficulty lies in the subtle inaccuracy in statement 2, which requires the candidate to have precise knowledge of the initiative's target area. This, combined with the relatively straightforward information in statements 1 and 3, creates a challenging question that effectively tests both knowledge and the ability to discriminate between similar concepts.


**8. With reference to the Sri Madhava Perumal Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located in present-day Tamil Nadu, it is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and largely remains submerged due to the Bhavanisagar dam.
2.  Inscriptions at the temple revealed a 1000-year-old trade route connecting the Kongu region with southern Karnataka and Kerala.
3.  The temple's pillars showcase the Chola architectural style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sri Madhava Perumal Temple is located in Tamil Nadu and is largely submerged due to the Bhavanisagar dam.  This demonstrates an understanding of the temple's location and the impact of dam construction on historical sites.


Statement 2 is correct. Inscriptions at the temple have indeed revealed a 1000-year-old trade route connecting the Kongu region with southern Karnataka and Kerala.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical trade routes and their discovery through archaeological evidence.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The temple pillars are depicted in the Nayaka art style, not the Chola style. This incorrect stylistic attribution is a potent distractor, requiring a precise knowledge of South Indian architectural styles.  The question tests not only the temple's historical context but also the ability to identify different architectural styles.


The question effectively tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information regarding historical sites, requiring a good understanding of South Indian history, geography, and architectural styles. The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect architectural style in statement 3 significantly increases the difficulty.


**9. With reference to the Kesariya Stupa, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located in West Champaran, Bihar, it is considered the tallest brick-built Buddhist stupa in the world.
2.  Chinese travelers Xuanzang and Fa-Hien mentioned the stupa in their accounts of their travels to India.
3.  The stupa is believed to commemorate the spot where Lord Buddha gave his 23rd sermon and announced his impending death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Kesariya Stupa is located in East Champaran, Bihar, and is considered one of the tallest Buddhist stupas in the world. The slight inaccuracy in the location (East instead of West) acts as a distractor, testing attention to detail. The focus is on its significance as a large stupa, not the precise district.


Statement 2 is correct.  Both Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) and Fa-Hien did mention the stupa in their travelogues. This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical accounts and their connection to specific sites.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the stupa is believed to commemorate an important event in Buddha's life and his impending death, it is associated with his 22nd, not 23rd, sermon. This seemingly minor numerical difference is a key distractor, testing precise factual recall.


The question successfully challenges the candidate's knowledge of Buddhist history, geography, and the details of historical accounts. The combination of a slight geographical inaccuracy and a numerical error in the statements increases the difficulty, requiring a high degree of precision and factual recall.


**10. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and features a temple built in the Dravidian architectural style.
2.  The main temple has entrances from the east and north and features a low basement with mouldings decorated with honeysuckle and geese designs.
3.  The Vajrasana, a polished sandstone platform, marks the spot where Buddha attained enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the Mahabodhi Temple Complex is located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, the architectural style is incorrect. The temple's architecture is neither purely Dravidian nor Nagara but a unique blend.  This blend is a crucial point to note, and the incorrect attribution of a single style acts as a strong distractor.


Statement 2 is correct. The temple does have entrances from the east and north, and its low basement features the described mouldings. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the temple's specific architectural features.


Statement 3 is largely correct. The Vajrasana does mark the spot where Buddha is believed to have meditated, but the statement of it being the spot where he attained enlightenment is debated among scholars.  While commonly understood as such, the nuance requires a higher level of understanding.  The seemingly minor difference in the event marked by the Vajrasana serves as a key distractor.


The question tests not only knowledge of the temple's location and status but also its architectural nuances and the historical significance of the Vajrasana.  The inclusion of an imprecise architectural style and a detail that requires deeper understanding increases the question's difficulty level, demanding a higher-order understanding of the subject.


**1. With reference to ancient Indian history and archaeology, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War, fought in 261 BCE, resulted in the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire and significantly impacted Emperor Ashoka's subsequent embrace of Buddhism.
2. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha, primarily associated with Jainism, were constructed during the reign of King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty in the 2nd century BCE.
3.  The Hathigumpha inscription, found within the Udayagiri caves, details the military campaigns of King Kharavela and is written in the Brahmi script.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect historical facts. The Kalinga War was a pivotal event in Ashoka's life, leading to his conversion to Buddhism and his subsequent emphasis on non-violence.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are indeed significant examples of early rock-cut architecture in Odisha, primarily associated with Jain monastic activities during the rule of Kharavela. The Hathigumpha inscription, carved within the caves, serves as a primary historical source detailing Kharavela's reign and military achievements, written in the Brahmi script.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit crucial aspects of the historical record related to the Kalinga War, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, and the Hathigumpha inscription.


**2. With reference to ancient Indian art and architecture, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest examples of rock-cut cave traditions in Odisha are found at the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.
2.  Neolithic era caves are located in Nandi Hills, showcasing evidence of early human habitation in the region.
3.  The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi, a prime example of Dravidian architecture, exhibits a blend of architectural styles from various dynasties, including the Chalukyas, Hoysalas, and Vijayanagara empires.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves represent the earliest known rock-cut cave traditions in Odisha. Nandi Hills contain Neolithic era caves, indicating early human settlement. The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi is a remarkable example of Dravidian architecture, showcasing influences from multiple dynasties over its long history of construction and expansion.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to encompass the full range of architectural and historical significance presented in the statements.



**3. With reference to the history of Srikakulam, consider the following statements:**

1. Srikakulam, formerly known as Chicacole, was part of the Kalinga Dynasty in the 3rd century BCE.
2.  After the Kalinga Dynasty, Srikakulam came under the rule of the Gajapati Kingdom, followed by the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, Kakatiya and Vijayanagara Empires.
3.  Srikakulam has significant Buddhist sites, including Salihundam (from where Buddhism is believed to have spread to Sumatra and other eastern countries) and Danthapuri.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are historically accurate. Srikakulam's history traces back to the Kalinga Dynasty, followed by a succession of powerful kingdoms including the Gajapatis, Eastern Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, and Vijayanagara Empire. The presence of significant Buddhist sites like Salihundam and Danthapuri further supports the rich historical and cultural heritage of the region.  The other options are thus incorrect, as they fail to account for the entirety of Srikakulam's historical trajectory and its multifaceted cultural legacy.


**4. With reference to prehistoric rock art in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, feature linear representations of animals like bison, elephants, and tigers, along with stick-like human figures.
2.  The Mesolithic period is characterized by a larger number of rock paintings, predominantly depicting human scenes such as hunting and community dances.
3. Rock art from the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period shows a decline in vividness and vitality, with a predominance of white and red pigments, and depictions of pottery and metal tools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe the characteristics of prehistoric rock paintings in India across different periods. The Upper Paleolithic paintings are characterized by their linear style and focus on animal depictions.  Mesolithic paintings showcase more complex human-centric scenes. The Neolithic-Chalcolithic period shows a shift in style and pigment use, reflecting the changing technologies and lifestyles of the time.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of the evolution of prehistoric rock art in India.


**5. With reference to the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site discovered in Telangana.
2. Two new rock art sites have been discovered at Damaratogu in the Gundala mandal of Bhadradri Kothagudem district, Telangana.
3. Devarlabanda Mula, another newly discovered site, features only animal depictions, lacking human or weapon representations, and is associated with dolmenoid cists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**1. Consider the following statements about the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. The Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right of entry for all castes into the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.
2.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was arrested and received rigorous imprisonment during the movement, unlike other participants.
3. Mahatma Gandhi's support for the movement was unwavering and instrumental in its complete success in securing access to all four roads leading to the temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.  The central focus was on challenging this caste-based restriction on temple entry.

Statement 2 is also correct. Periyar played a crucial role, mobilizing volunteers and garnering public support.  His arrest and subsequent rigorous imprisonment highlight his significant contribution and the intensity of the movement's resistance against the established social order.  This fact distinguishes his experience from that of other participants.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi did support the movement, his involvement wasn't solely responsible for its success, and the movement didn't achieve complete success in opening all four roads to the temple.  The Satyagraha’s outcome was partial, only opening three out of the four roads.  This partial success contributed to the rift between Gandhi and Periyar, with Periyar expressing dissatisfaction with the incomplete victory.  The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, achieved later, signified a more substantial legal victory. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complex dynamics of the movement and its eventual outcome.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Saluva dynasty succeeded the Sangama dynasty, marking a period of significant territorial expansion for the empire.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign witnessed the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and decisive victories against the Sultan of Bijapur, leading to the empire's zenith.
3. The Amara-Nayakas, under the Vijayanagara system, were solely responsible for collecting taxes and had complete autonomy over their assigned territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Saluva dynasty did indeed succeed the Sangama dynasty. While the statement mentions "significant territorial expansion," this isn't entirely accurate in characterizing the Saluva period. It was more of a period of consolidation and stabilization after the decline of the Sangamas than one of major expansion.  However, the succession itself is historically accurate.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is indeed associated with the empire's zenith, and the mentioned military achievements are well-documented. The statement accurately reflects his significant military victories and territorial gains.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas were granted territories to rule, but they were not entirely autonomous. They were military commanders who collected taxes but had to share revenue with the Vijayanagara king.  They had responsibilities beyond tax collection, including maintaining irrigation works and temples.  The statement overstates their autonomy.


**3. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Robbery, executed in 1926, aimed to fund revolutionary activities by looting the British Indian Government treasury.
2.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Bhagat Singh were among the key figures involved in the Kakori Train Action.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the year. The Kakori Train Robbery took place in 1925, not 1926. The objective of looting the treasury to fund revolutionary activities remains accurate.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan were key figures, Bhagat Singh was not directly involved in the Kakori Train Robbery.  His association with revolutionary activities came later.

Statement 3 is correct. While the HRA had ambitions beyond Uttar Pradesh, its most significant actions and organizational strength were concentrated in that region.  The statement accurately reflects the geographic limitations of their influence at that stage of the movement.

Statement 2 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign is well-known for its social reforms, including promoting women's education and actively working against harmful social customs like Sati.  Her patronage of arts and literature also contributed to cultural flourishing during her rule.

Statement 3 is correct. Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War did lead to the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly impacting the Holkar's political autonomy and solidifying British influence over their territory.  This treaty marked a turning point in the relationship between the Holkars and the British East India Company.


**5.  With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions extended to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and parts of Southeast Asia, establishing Chola dominance in the Indian Ocean.
2. The Chola empire's economic strength primarily relied on agriculture, with limited involvement in maritime trade.
3.  Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded the Chola empire's territorial reach into the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajaraja Chola I's reign witnessed significant naval expansions, which extended the Chola empire's influence across the Indian Ocean.  His naval power was a key factor in his success.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While agriculture was undoubtedly important, the Chola empire's economy was heavily reliant on maritime trade.  Their naval power facilitated extensive trade networks across the Indian Ocean, contributing significantly to their economic prosperity.

Statement 3 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of parts of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded the Chola empire's territorial reach into Southeast Asia, especially the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This expansion demonstrates the extent of their military and naval capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nalanda's admission process was indeed highly selective, and entrance was based on merit through rigorous examinations conducted by trained individuals.

Statement 2 is correct. The vast library of Nalanda, known as "Dharma Gunj," contained a huge collection of books, reflecting its status as a major center of learning.  The statement accurately describes the scale of the library.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While a decline in royal patronage may have played a role, the main reason for Nalanda's destruction was the invasion by the Turkish general Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205 AD.  The statement omits this crucial historical event, misrepresenting the cause of the university's demise.  Internal conflicts might have contributed to its weakening but were not the primary cause of its destruction.


**7. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion, which began in 1856, was a significant uprising against the British East India Company and the Zamindari system.
2.  The rebellion, led by prominent figures such as Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu, was primarily confined to the present-day states of Bihar and Odisha.
3.  The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876, enacted after the rebellion, aimed to protect Santhal land rights and prevent their exploitation by non-Santhals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the year.  The rebellion started in 1855, not 1856.  However, the rest of the description of the rebellion's target (British East India Company and the Zamindari system) is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the states involved. The rebellion primarily affected present-day Jharkhand and West Bengal, not Bihar and Odisha.  The geographic scope of the rebellion needs correction.

Statement 3 is correct. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 was indeed enacted as a response to the rebellion, seeking to protect Santhal land rights and limit exploitation by non-Santhals.  This legislative response reflects the British reaction to the rebellion and their attempts to address some of its underlying causes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While drought and crop failure were contributing factors, the Odisha Famine of 1866 was also influenced by other factors including administrative failures and economic issues.  The statement oversimplifies the causes.

Statement 2 is correct. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw faced significant criticism for his handling of the famine, with his response considered ineffective in mitigating the suffering caused.  His administrative role during the crisis is historically associated with criticism.

Statement 3 is correct. The construction of the Puri Canal (or Coast Canal) was indeed undertaken after the famine as a measure to improve irrigation and address the vulnerabilities exposed by the crisis.  This infrastructural project reflects the post-famine efforts to improve the region's resilience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Saragarhi involved a small contingent of Sikh soldiers facing a much larger force of Afghan tribesmen.  The statement accurately describes the disparity in troop numbers.

Statement 2 is correct. Saragarhi's strategic importance as a communication post is historically significant.  The defense of this post was crucial for maintaining British communication lines.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 21 Sikh soldiers did not surrender; they fought to the death, showcasing exceptional bravery and courage in the face of overwhelming odds.  Their heroic defense is a celebrated aspect of the battle's history.  The statement misrepresents the outcome of the battle.


**1. With reference to ancient Indian history and archaeology, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire and significantly influenced Emperor Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism.
2. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha, built during the reign of Kharavela in the 2nd century BCE, primarily served as dwelling places for Buddhist monks.
3. The Hathigumpha inscription, found in one of the Udayagiri caves, details the military campaigns of Kharavela and is written in the Brahmi script.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kalinga War was a pivotal moment in Ashoka's reign.  The brutality of the war led to his conversion to Buddhism and a shift in his policies towards non-violence and dharma.  The annexation of Kalinga significantly expanded the Mauryan Empire's territory.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built during the 2nd century BCE under Kharavela's patronage, they were primarily built for Jain monks, not Buddhist monks.  This is a key detail often missed in general discussions of the caves. The architectural style and the religious iconography within the caves strongly support their Jain association.

Statement 3 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription is a crucial primary source for understanding Kharavela's reign. It's carved into a rock face within the Udayagiri caves and provides valuable details about his military achievements and political activities.  The use of the Brahmi script is well-established in scholarly research.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site, not Neolithic.  The difference is crucial: the Neolithic period predates the use of iron. The presence of iron artifacts at Ooragutta places it firmly within the Iron Age.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rock art at Damaratogu in Gundala mandal primarily depicts animals, not human figures or weaponry.  The absence of human figures and weapons is a notable feature of this particular site, contrasting with other rock art sites in the region.

Statement 3 is correct. Devarlabanda Mula is indeed known for its Dolmenoid Cists. These semi-subterranean chamber tombs are a characteristic feature of the megalithic culture in the region, and their presence at Devarlabanda Mula aligns with this pattern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some abstract elements might be present, the earliest Indian rock paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period primarily feature animal figures (bison, elephants, tigers, etc.) and stick-like human representations.  These are rendered in colors like green and dark red.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mesolithic rock art shows a shift towards scenes of human life, particularly hunting scenes and community gatherings.  The style often contrasts naturalistic animal depictions with more stylized human figures.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While there is a degree of stylistic change, the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period's rock art doesn't show a complete decline in vibrancy.  The colors used were white and red (from haematite and limestone, respectively), not primarily black and brown.


**4. With reference to the Srikakulam region's history and cultural sites, consider the following statements:**

1.  Srikakulam, formerly known as Chicacole, was part of the Kalinga dynasty, followed by the Gajapati kingdom, and later, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi.
2.  The region boasts significant Buddhist sites like Salihundam, known for its role in spreading Buddhism eastward, and Danthapuri, a lesser-known but equally important Buddhist site.
3.  Jainism is also represented in the region with sites like Tangamayyakonda and Rottavalasa primarily showcasing cave temples dedicated to Jain Tirthankaras.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Srikakulam's historical trajectory accurately reflects its association with the Kalinga dynasty, followed by the Gajapati kingdom and the Eastern Chalukyas.  This chronological sequence is well-documented in historical records.

Statement 2 is correct.  Salihundam's importance in the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia is well-established.  Danthapuri, though less extensively documented than Salihundam, remains a significant Buddhist site within the region.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Tangamayyakonda and Rottavalasa are significant Jain sites, they are not primarily known for cave temples.  The architectural styles and the religious iconography found at these sites differ from the typical cave temple architecture found in other regions.  The sites feature other types of structures associated with Jain religious practices.


**5. With reference to the Chandravalli cave complex in Karnataka, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chandravalli cave complex, also known as Ankali Math, exhibits evidence of human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era, predating the Iron Age.
2.  The complex contains a variety of chambers, including a Shiva linga shrine, living quarters for ascetics, and a water management system.
3.  Artifacts and inscriptions at the site point to associations with the Satavahana, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara dynasties, but lack any evidence of Roman or Chinese influence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chandravalli cave complex has evidence of Iron Age habitation, there's no evidence of Paleolithic occupation.  The archaeological findings are consistent with the Iron Age, not the much earlier Paleolithic period.

Statement 2 is correct. The complex's architectural features accurately reflect the presence of a Shiva linga shrine, rooms for visitors and ascetics, and a sophisticated water management system.  These features are significant in understanding the complex's functionality.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chandravalli cave complex does show evidence of Satavahana, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara influences.  However, there is also evidence suggesting Roman and Chinese interaction, indicating a broader network of cultural exchange.  The presence of certain artifacts and stylistic elements points towards these influences.

Statement 2 is correct. Vikramshila University's association with Atisha Dipankara is well-documented. Its location in Bihar is also accurately stated.

Statement 3 is correct. Odantapuri's founding by Gopal I and its role as a center of learning attracting Tibetan scholars are historically accurate.


**10. With reference to megalithic sites and the Ahom dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Megalithic burial practices, associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, were characterized by the use of stone circles and dolmens, but rarely involved the use of iron artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While megalithic burial practices are associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period and often feature stone circles and dolmens, the use of iron artifacts was not uncommon, especially in later stages of the megalithic tradition.

Statement 2 is correct. Hire Benkal's inclusion in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status is accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ahom dynasty's rule, their unique burial customs (Moidams), and their adoption of Shaivism and the Shakti movement are all well-documented aspects of their history and culture.


**11. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut) and its historical significance, consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, located on the Malabar Coast, was ruled by the Cholas during the medieval period, and its spice trade played a crucial role in its prominence.
2. The term "calico," referring to fine hand-woven cotton cloth, is believed to have originated from Calicut, highlighting the region's textile production.
3. Kozhikode's recognition as India's first UNESCO City of Literature underscores its rich literary tradition and its contribution to the development of various Indian languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kozhikode's spice trade was pivotal, it was primarily ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) during the medieval period, not the Cholas. The Cholas had a significant presence in South India but not direct rule over Kozhikode during the relevant period.

Statement 2 is correct. The etymology of "calico" is indeed linked to Calicut, reflecting the region's historical expertise in cotton textile production.

Statement 3 is correct. Kozhikode's recognition as India's first UNESCO City of Literature accurately reflects its significant literary heritage and its contributions to various literary traditions.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1. Rajaraja Chola's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended to regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I resulted in the annexation of only the island's northern part.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja Chola's significant naval victory was against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. The Pandyas were another significant power in South India, and while the Cholas had conflicts with them, the provided text doesn't mention a decisive naval battle against the Pandyas under Rajaraja Chola.  Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra Chola I launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text clearly indicates that Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka led to the entire island becoming a Chola province, not just the northern part.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, and statement 1 and 2 are partially correct.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is primarily focused on preserving traditional pastoralist practices in the Himalayas.
2.  In 2023, transhumance traditions from only European countries were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.
3. The practice of transhumance in India is limited to the Himalayan region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but overstates the initiative's focus. While the initiative does address traditional livestock movement, it's not solely focused on the Himalayas. The initiative is broader and encompasses various regions and traditions. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifies that in 2023, two transhumance traditions – one from multiple European states and another from Switzerland – were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the transhumance system exists in both the Himalayas and the plains of several Indian states including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, all three statements contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications.



**3. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan script, written in a boustrophedon style, has been fully deciphered.
2.  Evidence suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization engaged in extensive trade with Mesopotamia, with Meluha representing the Indus region in Mesopotamian records.
3.  The primary deities of the Indus Valley Civilization were clearly identified as Vishnu and Shiva.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harappan script, while written in boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), remains undeciphered.  Statement 2 is correct. Mesopotamian records do refer to the Indus region as Meluha, indicating significant trade interactions between the two civilizations.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization had deities represented in seals and figurines (e.g., Pasupati, a proto-Shiva figure, and the Mother Goddess), direct identification with later Hindu deities like Vishnu is not definitively established. The religious practices and beliefs of the Indus Valley Civilization are still under scholarly debate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC is being developed solely by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways.
2. Lothal's significance lies in its being a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization and possessing the oldest known man-made dry dock.
3. The NMHC aims to showcase India's maritime heritage exclusively from the ancient period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC is being developed under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, not solely by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways.  Statement 2 is correct. Lothal's importance is clearly highlighted in the text as a significant Indus Valley Civilization site with the oldest known man-made dry dock.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMHC's aim is to showcase India's maritime heritage from ancient times to the present, encompassing a broader timeframe. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to Charaideo Moidams, consider the following statements:**

1. Charaideo Moidams are located in the foothills of the Eastern Ghats.
2. These structures are the burial sites of the Ahom royalty and are considered comparable to the Egyptian pyramids.
3. Their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List marks the second UNESCO World Heritage site from Assam.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Charaideo Moidams are situated in the foothills of the Patkai Ranges, not the Eastern Ghats. The Patkai range is part of the Eastern Himalayas. Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly describes the Moidams as the royal necropolis of the Tai-Ahom dynasty, comparing them to the Egyptian pyramids. Statement 3 is incorrect. The inscription of Charaideo Moidams marks the third UNESCO World Heritage site in Assam (including Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park), not the second. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**6. With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) signed between India and the USA, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the repatriation of Indian antiquities to India only from the USA.
2. The agreement primarily focuses on preventing the illicit trafficking of Indian archaeological material.
3. The CPA is independent of and unrelated to the 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPA aids in the repatriation of Indian antiquities, its scope is not limited to the USA.  The agreement aims to prevent illicit trafficking globally, facilitating the return of artifacts to India from various countries. Statement 2 is correct. The agreement's primary objective is to curb the illegal trafficking of Indian antiquities, including archaeological and ethnological materials.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The CPA aligns with and complements the 1970 UNESCO Convention on preventing illicit trade in cultural property, aiming to strengthen international cooperation in this area. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to the Kalinga dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) led to the expansion of the Kalinga dynasty's territory.
2. Kharavela, a significant ruler of the Kalinga dynasty, is known for his patronage of Jainism.
3.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built during the Gupta period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in the Mauryan Empire's annexation of Kalinga, not an expansion of the Kalinga dynasty's territory.  Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela's reign is well-known for his patronage of Jainism, as evidenced by his association with the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While there are Vaishnavite caves in Udayagiri near Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh) from the Gupta period, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha were built during the reign of King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty, around the 2nd century BCE.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to Megalithic burials, consider the following statements:**

1. Megalithic burials are exclusively associated with the Iron Age.
2. The practice of urn burial is not associated with Megalithic culture.
3.  Hire Benkal, a megalithic site in Karnataka, is currently a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While megalithic burials are often associated with the Iron Age, their origins trace back to earlier periods, including the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Urn burial is a practice associated with some megalithic cultures.  The text mentions urn burial from the Chalcolithic site of Inamgaon, Maharashtra, demonstrating a connection between urn burial and megalithic traditions.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Hire Benkal is under consideration for the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites, but it is not yet officially a World Heritage site. Therefore, all three statements are inaccurate.


**9. With reference to the Ahom dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kingdom was established by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince from Yunnan province in China.
2. The Ahom kings held absolute power, unconstrained by any council or ministerial influence.
3.  The Ahom dynasty adopted and patronized Buddhism exclusively, building numerous Buddhist temples across Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Sukaphaa, a Shan prince, established the Ahom kingdom after migrating from Mong Mao, which is associated with Yunnan province in China.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ahom political system, while a monarchy, involved a significant role for the Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris).  The king's power was not absolute.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ahoms adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, patronizing both Hindu and some indigenous religious practices. They did not exclusively focus on Buddhism. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**10. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut), consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode is located on the Coromandel Coast.
2.  The Samoothiris (Zamorins) ruled Kozhikode during the medieval period.
3.  Kozhikode's historical significance is primarily associated with its role as a major center for the silk trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode (Calicut) is situated on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast.  Statement 2 is correct. The Samoothiris (Zamorins) were the rulers of Kozhikode during the medieval period.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Kozhikode engaged in extensive trade, its historical importance is primarily linked to its role as a major center for the spice trade (black pepper, cardamom, etc.), not the silk trade. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**11. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. Ahilyabai Holkar succeeded her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, directly as the ruler of Malwa.
2. She is known for her extensive temple reconstruction work, including the Kashi Vishvanath Temple and the Somnath Temple.
3.  Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage primarily focused on Persian literature and art forms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar became the ruler of Malwa after the death of her husband and her father-in-law, not directly succeeding her father-in-law.  Statement 2 is correct.  Ahilyabai Holkar is renowned for her contributions to temple reconstruction, notably the Kashi Vishvanath Temple and the Somnath Temple.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Her patronage extended to Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram and Marathi poet Moropant, indicating a focus on Indian literature and art, not exclusively Persian ones. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, consider the following statements:**

1. The present Mahabodhi Temple dates back to the 3rd century BCE, built by Emperor Ashoka.
2. The temple's architecture is a unique blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.
3. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex includes the sacred Bodhi Tree, believed to be a descendant of the tree under which Buddha attained Enlightenment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Emperor Ashoka marked the site with a pillar, the present Mahabodhi Temple dates from the 5th-6th centuries CE, not the 3rd century BCE.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The temple architecture is described as having a classical Indian temple style with a curvilinear shikhara but is neither purely Dravidian nor Nagara.  Statement 3 is correct. The sacred Bodhi Tree is a key component of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, considered a descendant of the original tree.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**13. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2.  The temple is situated at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavani rivers.
3. All Sangameshwar temples in India are UNESCO World Heritage sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  Statement 2 is partially correct, but not entirely precise. The text mentions the confluence of Krishna and Bhavansi rivers along with five other tributaries.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While some Sangameshwar temples may be of historical or architectural significance, the text doesn't indicate that *all* of them are UNESCO World Heritage sites.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**14. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kamakhya Temple is located on the Nilachal hills in Odisha.
2. The temple's architecture is primarily in the Dravidian style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kamakhya Temple is located on the Nilachal hills in Assam, not Odisha.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The temple's architecture is a blend of styles, incorporating elements from Upper Burma, Pala style of Bengal, and later Ahom style, not purely Dravidian.  Statement 3 is correct. The Ambubachi Mela festival is indeed a commemoration of the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

1. The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in the Indian state of Punjab.
2. The agreement on the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor is valid indefinitely.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is situated in Pakistan's Narowal district, not in India.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement on the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has a limited validity period, recently extended for five years.  Statement 3 is correct.  The corridor facilitates pilgrimage between Dera Baba Nanak (India) and Kartarpur Sahib (Pakistan).  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**16. With reference to the Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jagannath Temple's architecture is a distinctive blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.
2. The Ratna Bhandar is located on the eastern side of the Jagamohana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The temple's architecture is described as having a classical Indian temple style with a curvilinear shikhara, but it's neither purely Dravidian nor Nagara.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ratna Bhandar (treasury) is situated on the northern side of the Jagamohana (assembly hall), not the eastern side.  Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions carvings of 24 forms of Vishnu on the outer walls of the main temple.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**17. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple, Hampi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2. The temple's earliest shrine was built in the 14th century CE.
3. The temple's architecture is primarily in the Dravidian style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha (a form of Shiva), not Lord Vishnu.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Inscriptions suggest the earliest shrine was constructed much earlier, in 740 CE, not the 14th century CE.  Statement 3 is correct. The temple's architecture is explicitly described as a prime example of the Dravidian style.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended the Chola empire's influence to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal significantly hampered the spice trade of the Arab merchants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects Rajendra I's significant naval expansion, reaching the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  His conquests extended the Chola empire's reach far beyond the immediate Indian subcontinent.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while Rajaraja I did achieve naval victories, his focus extended beyond the Coromandel Coast to include Sri Lanka and other strategic locations to control trade routes and secure the empire's interests.  Statement 3 is a misconception; while Chola naval power undoubtedly impacted maritime trade, there's no evidence to suggest it significantly hampered the spice trade of Arab merchants to the extent of crippling it. The Chola's were known for their flourishing trade with Southeast Asia, suggesting a more cooperative or at least less antagonistic relationship with various trading partners than the statement implies.  The Chola maritime dominance was more about asserting their power and securing their trade interests, not necessarily about completely blocking other players.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is a joint project between UNESCO and the World Bank focusing on sustainable pastoralism.
2. Transhumance, as a practice, involves the seasonal migration of both livestock and human communities.
3. The Transhumance Landscapes of India are primarily confined to the Himalayan region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly defines transhumance as the seasonal movement of both livestock and the human communities that tend them.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the initiative is supported by Azerbaijan and led by ICOMOS, it is not a joint UNESCO-World Bank project. The involvement of international organizations varies across different transhumance initiatives, but the specific partnership mentioned isn't accurate for this particular one. Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While the Himalayas are a significant area for transhumance in India, the practice also exists in various plains regions, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The question aims to test the knowledge of the geographic spread of transhumance in India, highlighting the diversity of regions where this traditional practice continues.

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes only manuscripts written in Sanskrit.
2.  The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Beijing, China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct; the Ramcharitmanas was indeed included in the register.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the register encompasses manuscripts from various languages, not just Sanskrit. The inclusion of diverse literary works reflects the richness and variety of the Asia-Pacific region's documentary heritage. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. The location of the meeting is a detail that requires specific knowledge about the organization and its activities. The question tests knowledge of the MOW program and its specific details, including the location of meetings and the languages of included documents.


**4. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative aims to promote the use of genetically modified cotton to enhance yield and quality.
2. The Cotton Corporation of India is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.
3. Blockchain technology is utilized for ensuring 100% traceability and certification of Kasturi Cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is accurate; blockchain technology is a core element of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, enabling complete traceability and certification of the cotton.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the initiative does not promote genetically modified cotton.  The focus is on premium quality Indian cotton with a strong emphasis on sustainability and traceability.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; while the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the primary implementing agency. The question tests understanding of the initiative's goals, technologies used, and the roles of different organizations involved.  The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately false statements, requiring a deep understanding of the initiative's specifics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are indeed the executing agencies, and the project's aim is to democratize art by creating public installations in urban spaces. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the project includes traditional art forms, its primary focus is not limited to rural areas but extends to urban landscapes. The project's scope encompasses both traditional and contemporary art, aiming to create accessible public art spaces in cities. The question tests knowledge of the project's scope, location, and executing agencies, highlighting the complexities of art promotion initiatives in India.


**6. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is limited to promoting tourism in the Himalayan region of India.
2. The initiative aims to train local communities to become tourism ambassadors and storytellers for their destinations.
3. The initiative focuses solely on the development of luxury tourism products and experiences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the initiative's core objective: to train local people, particularly women and youth, to become tourism ambassadors and to develop tourism-related products and experiences. Statement 1 is incorrect; the initiative is not limited to the Himalayan region but spans across 50 tourist destinations nationwide. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the initiative does involve developing new products and experiences, it's not solely focused on luxury tourism but aims for a broader range of offerings, including those catering to a wider range of budgets.  The question assesses understanding of the initiative's geographic scope, target audience, and the types of tourism products it promotes.


**7. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The delisting process is governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.
2. The term "missing monuments" is officially used in the AMASR Act to describe untraceable monuments.
3. The National Monuments Authority (NMA) directly oversees the delisting of centrally protected monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for delisting monuments that cease to be of national importance.  Statement 2 is incorrect; "missing monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act; it originated from CAG audit reports. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the NMA plays a crucial role in the protection and preservation of monuments, the central government ultimately holds the authority to delist monuments based on the recommendations from the Ministry of Culture and the ASI's assessment. The question tests understanding of the legal framework surrounding the delisting of monuments, highlighting the roles of different government bodies in the process.


**8. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University was established in the 10th century CE.
2. The new Nalanda University campus is designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While untraceability is a factor considered by the ASI, the decision to delist a monument also involves an assessment of its national importance.  A monument might be untraceable due to various reasons, not necessarily indicating a lack of national significance. The ASI considers multiple factors before recommending delisting to the Ministry of Culture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act, 1958.  It emerged from the usage of the CAG Audit team in their report, highlighting the lack of official terminology for monuments that are difficult to locate or verify.

Statement 3 is correct. Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, empowers the Central Government to declare that a monument has ceased to be of national importance.  This delisting removes the protection afforded by the ASI, opening the way for construction and other activities in the designated area.  The process, however, requires due procedure and assessment.

It was envisioned as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue and advanced learning, not just a museum for ancient artifacts. The decision to establish it originated at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University's curriculum was extensive and encompassed a wide range of disciplines, including politics and war strategy, alongside religious studies and the arts. It was a comprehensive center of learning, not limited to religious teachings.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The modern Nalanda University aims to be a center for interdisciplinary research and education, engaging with both ancient knowledge and contemporary issues. It is not solely focused on preserving the past; instead, it seeks to build upon it for the future.  Its focus on inter-civilizational dialogue reflects a modern, global outlook.

This builds brand value and combats issues of adulteration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL is a key implementing agency, the initiative is a collaborative effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  TEXPROCIL's role is significant, but it is not solely responsible for all aspects of the initiative.  Other stakeholders play crucial roles in various stages of implementation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is awarded for exceptional bravery in the face of the enemy during wartime, not peacetime. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ashoka Chakra (initially in three classes), Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards, they were not all instituted in 1952.  The original Ashoka Chakra classes were instituted in 1952, but the current names (Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra) came into effect in 1967 after renaming. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gallantry awards are announced twice a year – once on Republic Day and once on Independence Day.  All three statements contain inaccuracies.

The Directorate of Film Festivals has indeed administered the awards since 1973.  Thus, only statement 3 is accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include false statements about the establishment year and the number of award categories.  A solid understanding of the National Film Awards necessitates knowledge of their founding year, the award categories, and the administrative body.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.  The other options are incorrect because they include statements that are false regarding the recommendation process and the financial aspects of the award.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the award's conferral process, its financial aspects, and its notable recipients.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but ultimately inaccurate.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme was launched in 1992, not 1982. Statement 2 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas is mentioned as an example of an Indian work included in the International Register. Statement 3 is incorrect. Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is a text on Indian poetics, not astronomy. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. The other options include inaccuracies about the launch year of the programme and the subject matter of Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The agreement was signed in 2019, not 2014. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Indian pilgrims have visa-free access, the agreement does *not* grant Pakistani Sikhs visa-free access to Dera Baba Nanak in India. Statement 3 is correct. Pakistan does levy a fee (USD 20) on each pilgrim visiting Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.  Thus, only statement 3 is correct. The other options incorrectly include false information regarding the signing year of the agreement and the visa-free access for Pakistani Sikhs. This question tests knowledge of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, including the year of signing, the conditions of access for pilgrims from both sides, and the fee levied by Pakistan.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the agreement's specifics.


**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "Missing Monuments" as those that cannot be located by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
2.  The Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance, thereby removing ASI protection.
3. The Act mandates the preservation of all ancient monuments regardless of their current condition or location.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The AMASR Act, 1958, is the primary legislation governing the protection of ancient monuments and archaeological sites in India. Statement 2 correctly reflects a key provision of the Act: the Central Government has the power to delist monuments that are determined to no longer be of national importance.  This process involves assessing the historical significance and current state of the monument. If a monument is deemed unworthy of national-level protection, it can be delisted, meaning it will lose the conservation and protection afforded by the ASI.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act does not formally define "Missing Monuments." This term emerged from CAG audit reports. Statement 3 is incorrect as the Act focuses on monuments of national importance; it doesn't mandate the preservation of all ancient monuments regardless of their significance or condition. The Act allows for the selective protection of historically and culturally significant sites.  The delisting provision reflects a pragmatic approach to conservation, acknowledging that the significance of certain monuments may diminish over time.


**2. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right to education for lower-caste Hindus in Travancore.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi actively participated in the Satyagraha's daily protests from its inception.
3. The movement achieved complete success in opening all access routes to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes immediately after its conclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Vaikom Satyagraha (1924-1925) was a significant non-violent movement in Travancore (present-day Kerala) fighting against caste-based discrimination. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Satyagraha's central aim was to challenge the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, not specifically education. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement and offered guidance, he didn't participate in the daily protests.  Statement 3 is inaccurate; the Satyagraha achieved partial success, opening only three of the four roads leading to the temple.  The movement's impact was significant in raising awareness about caste discrimination and ultimately contributed to legal reforms, but it didn't immediately achieve complete temple entry for all castes. The event highlights the complexities of social reform movements in India, demonstrating both partial victories and the ongoing struggle against caste-based inequalities.  The involvement of various leaders and the movement's impact on later temple entry reforms underscore its historical importance in the fight for social justice.


**3. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The modern Nalanda University was established based on a decision made at the first East Asia Summit (EAS).
2.  The ancient Nalanda University primarily focused on Buddhist studies, excluding other disciplines.
3. The modern Nalanda University campus is located far from the ruins of the ancient university.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Nalanda University, both ancient and modern, holds significant historical and educational importance. Statement 1 is incorrect; the decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was made at the *second* East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007, not the first. Statement 2 is incorrect; the ancient Nalanda University was a renowned center of learning, offering a wide range of subjects beyond Buddhist studies, including medicine, astronomy, politics, and military strategy, making it a truly multidisciplinary institution. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the modern Nalanda University campus is situated near the ruins of its ancient counterpart in Rajgir, Bihar, highlighting a deliberate connection to its historical legacy. The establishment of the modern university reflects a commitment to reviving the spirit of intellectual exchange and academic excellence that characterized the ancient Nalanda.  The contrast between the breadth of subjects in the ancient institution and the potential focus of the modern university illustrates the evolution of educational philosophies.



**4. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The award's recipient is permitted to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name.
2. The award was initially conferred posthumously.
3.  The Prime Minister makes recommendations for the Bharat Ratna to the President.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits the use of the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to one's name. Recipients can, however, mention their receipt of the award in their biographies or on official documents.  Statement 2 is incorrect; initially, the award was *not* conferred posthumously; this practice changed in 1966. Statement 3 is correct; the Prime Minister recommends candidates for the Bharat Ratna to the President, although there is no formal, mandatory process. The award's design, selection process, and regulations reflect the significance attached to it as India's highest honor. The evolution of its rules, such as the posthumous conferral, showcases the adaptation of the award's framework over time.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangama dynasty ruled the empire from its inception until its decline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara Empire was a powerful South Indian kingdom. Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Sangama dynasty founded the empire, it was followed by the Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the empire's territorial extent fluctuated throughout its existence, expanding and contracting based on military victories and losses.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; Amara-Nayakas were military commanders who also had administrative and revenue-collecting responsibilities within their territories. The empire's complex political structure, involving multiple dynasties and the Amara-Nayaka system, demonstrates its sophisticated administrative and military organization. The fluctuations in the empire's territorial reach underscore the dynamic nature of its political landscape.  The multifaceted roles of the Amara-Nayakas indicate the blending of military and administrative powers within the Vijayanagara system.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval campaigns primarily focused on consolidating control over the Malabar Coast.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended Chola influence to parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal significantly facilitated trade with Southeast Asian countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did engage in naval warfare, his campaigns extended beyond the Malabar Coast, encompassing Sri Lanka and other regions. His primary naval focus was on establishing Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal and beyond, not solely on the Malabar coast.  Rajaraja I's destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai demonstrates his broader naval ambitions.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's significant naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, substantially expanding the Chola Empire's reach and influence into Southeast Asia.  This reflects a clear expansionist naval strategy.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Chola navy's control of the Bay of Bengal created a secure and efficient trade route, enabling flourishing commerce with Southeast Asia. This maritime dominance was crucial for the economic prosperity of the Chola Empire, facilitating their "Look East Policy."  Nagapattinam served as a key trading center, highlighting the economic benefits of their naval power.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Saluva dynasty succeeded the Tuluva dynasty, marking a period of relative peace and prosperity.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the annexation of the Raichur Doab and military victories against Orissa and Bijapur.
3. The Amara-Nayakas were appointed as governors of specific territories but had little autonomy in their administration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Saluva dynasty *preceded* the Tuluva dynasty.  The Saluva dynasty's rule followed the decline of the Sangama dynasty and paved the way for the Tuluva dynasty's rise to power under the rule of Krishnadevaraya, who greatly expanded the empire's territory and influence.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is considered the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire. His military successes included the acquisition of the Raichur Doab (the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers), subduing Orissa, and inflicting defeats on the Sultan of Bijapur. These military achievements significantly expanded the empire's territory and solidified its power.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Amara-Nayakas were appointed by the Raya (king), they held considerable autonomy in their assigned territories. They collected taxes, retained a portion of the revenue for their personal use and maintenance of their armies, and oversaw local administration, including temple and irrigation works.  Their power and independence were significant features of the Vijayanagara political structure.


**3. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region, with nomadic tribes like the Gujars and Bakarwals migrating seasonally with their livestock.
2. The practice of transhumance is limited to hilly regions, and it doesn't exist in the plains of India.
3. The UNESCO has recognized specific transhumance traditions from India as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Transhumance is a prominent practice in the Himalayas, where nomadic communities like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas move their sheep and goats seasonally between subalpine/alpine pastures in summer and adjoining plains in winter. This seasonal migration is a defining characteristic of their lifestyle and livelihood.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Himalayan region is a significant area for transhumance, the practice also exists in the plains of several Indian states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. This demonstrates the broader geographical reach of transhumance in India, extending beyond the mountainous regions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While UNESCO has recognized transhumance traditions globally, the provided text does not specify that any *Indian* transhumance traditions have received this specific recognition.  The text mentions that two European traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023, but makes no such claim for India.


**4. With reference to the UNESCO Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains only an International Register of significant documents.
2.  Manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Beijing, China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. This multi-tiered system allows for a wider range of documentation and recognition of significant cultural heritage across different geographical levels. The statement incorrectly limits the program to only an international register.

Statement 2 is correct. The manuscripts of the three Indian literary works, Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, were indeed included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This highlights the international recognition of these important works of Indian literature and their value to global cultural heritage.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the 10th meeting of MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This factual error makes the statement incorrect.


**5. With reference to the  Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Harappan Civilization primarily flourished in the valleys of the Indus and Ganga rivers.
2.  The Harappans were among the earliest civilizations to cultivate cotton and use a standardized system of weights and measures.
3.  The Harappan script has been fully deciphered, revealing insights into their religious beliefs and social structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harappan Civilization primarily flourished in the Indus and Saraswati river basins, not the Ganga. While some settlements might have extended towards the Ganga, the core area of the civilization was centered around the Indus and Saraswati rivers.  The statement misrepresents the geographical extent of the civilization.

Statement 2 is correct. The Harappans were indeed among the earliest to cultivate cotton, a fact noted by the Greeks who referred to it as "Sindon."  They also employed a standardized system of weights and measures, indicating a well-organized and advanced society with a developed understanding of trade and commerce.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Harappan script remains undeciphered. Despite extensive research, the meaning of the symbols used in their writing system remains a mystery, limiting our understanding of their language, religious beliefs, and social structures. The statement presents an inaccurate claim about the state of knowledge regarding the script.


**1. With reference to ancient Indian temples, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is annually submerged in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.
2. The Kamakhya Temple, located on the Nilachal hills in Assam, was originally built in the 16th century by the Koch dynasty and exemplifies the Nilachal style of architecture, a blend of Upper Burmese and Pala styles.
3. The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi, Karnataka, is a prime example of Dravidian architecture and was initially constructed in 740 CE by a Chalukyan queen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu, and is situated at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers along with five other tributaries.  The annual submergence due to the Srisailam dam backwaters is accurate.  The error in the statement lies in the deity.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Kamakhya Temple's location and its reconstruction in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty are accurate. The description of the architectural style as a blend of Upper Burmese and Pala styles, later evolving into the Ahom style, is also correct. However, stating it exemplifies *only* the Nilachal style is an oversimplification of its complex architectural heritage.

Statement 3 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple's dedication to Lord Virupaksha (a form of Shiva), its location in Hampi, its classification as Dravidian architecture, and the historical detail about its initial construction in 740 CE by a Chalukyan queen are all factually accurate. The temple's expansion and contributions from other dynasties over the centuries are also historically supported. Therefore, statement 3 presents a correct and detailed account.


**2. With reference to the geographical features of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhi Sarovar (originally Kanti Sarovar), located near the Kedarnath Temple, originates from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier and is associated with a mythological tale of Lord Shiva teaching yoga to the Saptrishis.
2. The Siang River, originating near Mount Kailash in Tibet, flows eastward for over 1000 km before entering Arunachal Pradesh as the Siang and eventually becoming the Brahmaputra in Assam.

Statement 2 accurately describes the course of the Siang River.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the source of the Sutlej River, its antecedent nature, and its position as an easternmost tributary of the Indus, including its Tibetan name.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements within any of the statements.


**3. With reference to India's cultural heritage, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of India's rich cultural heritage. Statement 1 correctly notes the inclusion of the specified manuscripts in the UNESCO register. Statement 2 accurately describes the Ambubachi Mela's significance and the temple's association with Tantric worship. Statement 3 correctly identifies the transhumance practice and mentions the relevant nomadic tribes and geographical areas.  Each statement is factually accurate and provides a concise yet informative description of a specific cultural element.


**4. With reference to  historical sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, features a main temple built in a classical Indian style with a curvilinear shikhara, but its design is neither purely Dravida nor Nagara.
2. The Vishnupad Temple in Gaya, Bihar, situated on the banks of the Falgu River, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and features a footprint (Dharmasila) marked by four symbols: conch-shell, wheel, mace, and lotus.
3. Lothal, Gujarat, a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization, is significant for its ancient man-made dry dock and is the site of the developing National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) under the Sagarmala Programme.

2. The Ahom Dynasty, established by Sukaphaa in the 13th century, ruled Assam until the Burmese invasion and subsequent British annexation in 1826.  Their administration was characterized by a powerful Council of Ministers despite the monarchy.
3. The Kalinga Dynasty, encompassing modern-day Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh, is notable for the Kalinga War (261 BCE) with the Mauryan Empire and the reign of Kharavela, known for his Jain patronage and the Hathigumpha inscription.

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat indeed focuses on premium quality Indian cotton with complete traceability and certification leveraging blockchain technology. This ensures transparency and builds consumer trust in the product's origin and quality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Textiles is a key player, the initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, Trade Bodies, and the Industry.  It's not solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles.  A collaborative approach is crucial for success in a complex agricultural and export-oriented sector.

Statement 3 is correct. TEXPROCIL serves as the implementing agency, responsible for the branding, traceability, and certification processes.  This highlights the involvement of a specialized export promotion council in ensuring the initiative's effective execution.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MOW Programme was launched in 1992, not 2002. While the Asia-Pacific Regional Register is a part of this larger initiative, the program's inception date is earlier.

Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana highlights the significant contribution of India's diverse literary traditions to global heritage.  These works represent different genres and eras, showcasing the breadth of Indian literature.

Statement 3 is correct. The decision to include the three Indian literary works in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register was indeed made at the 10th meeting of MOWCAP, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  This underscores the international recognition of these works' importance.


**3. With reference to the practice of transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayan regions of India, with nomadic tribes like the Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis moving their livestock seasonally between lowland and highland pastures.
2. The practice of transhumance in India is exclusively confined to the Himalayan region, with no similar practices observed in the plains of the country.
3.  During summer months, livestock is moved to sub-alpine and alpine pastures in the Himalayas for grazing, while during winter months, they are moved to the adjoining plains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving the mentioned tribes, it is not exclusive to the Himalayan region.  The statement oversimplifies the geographical spread of this practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Transhumance is also practiced in the plains of several Indian states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  This demonstrates the adaptability of the practice to different geographical contexts.

Statement 3 is correct. The seasonal movement of livestock between higher and lower altitudes is a key characteristic of transhumance in the Himalayas.  This pattern ensures access to suitable grazing grounds throughout the year, reflecting a deep understanding of the ecological rhythms of the region.


**4. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when the Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya.
2. The observation of IAD coincides with the end of the three-month rainy retreat (Vassa) for Buddhist monks and the Pavāraņā festival.
3. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observes IAD annually in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates the Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka (celestial realm) to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh, not his attainment of enlightenment.  The date of enlightenment is celebrated separately.

Statement 2 is correct. IAD's timing coincides with the end of Vassa (the rainy season retreat) and the Pavāraņā festival, both significant events in the Buddhist calendar. This adds religious and cultural significance to the observance.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in partnership with the IBC, actively participates in organizing and promoting IAD in India, reflecting the government's support for Buddhist cultural heritage.


**5. With reference to the  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 3 of the Act empowers the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct archaeological excavations across the country without requiring prior permission from landowners.
2.  The Act prohibits the export of antiquities outside India, aiming to protect the nation's cultural heritage.
3.  Section 4 of the Act mandates the National Monuments Authority (NMA) to grant permissions for construction within regulated areas near centrally protected monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Section 3 of the Act does not grant the ASI unrestricted powers to conduct excavations.  The Act does have provisions for archaeological excavations, but it also outlines procedures and permissions needed, involving consultation with landowners and other relevant authorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act explicitly prohibits the export of antiquities from India, aiming to safeguard the nation's cultural heritage and prevent the illicit outflow of valuable artifacts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NMA does deal with permissions related to construction near protected monuments, it's not mandated by Section 4 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972.  The NMA's functions are established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, a later legislation.  Section 4 of the 1972 Act deals with the Central Government's power to declare monuments of national importance.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval expeditions resulted in the annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka as a Chola province.
2.  The Chola navy's destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai significantly expanded Chola control over southern India's maritime trade.
3.  Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating extensive maritime trade with Southeast Asia.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime power and influence. Rajendra I, not Rajaraja I, is credited with the complete annexation of Sri Lanka. However, Rajaraja I's naval victories, including the one at Kandalursalai, laid the foundation for this later expansion.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai was a significant event that weakened a key rival and solidified Chola dominance in the region. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading hub is well-documented, supporting the extensive maritime trade networks the Cholas established with Southeast Asia.  The statement about Rajaraja I's conquest is a commonly held, albeit slightly inaccurate, understanding of Chola history, making it a good distractor. The other statements are factually accurate representations of established historical knowledge.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance, the seasonal movement of livestock, is a practice primarily confined to the Himalayan region of India.
2.  The Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes primarily associated with transhumance practices in the Himalayas, rearing sheep and goats.
3.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance in 10 European States are examples of transhumance practices that have been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it is also practiced in other parts of India, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  Statement 2 is accurate, correctly identifying the Himalayan nomadic tribes engaged in transhumance. Statement 3 is also accurate; the mentioned European transhumance traditions have indeed received UNESCO recognition as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.  The inclusion of the Himalayan tribes as a specific example, coupled with the mention of the European examples, creates a strong distractor, potentially leading candidates to believe that transhumance is limited to those specific regions.


**3. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMHC is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, primarily through Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).
2.  Lothal's historical significance lies in its status as a prominent Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) city, featuring the world's oldest known man-made dry dock, dating back to approximately 2400 BC.
3.  The primary aim of the NMHC is to showcase India's maritime heritage, encompassing the period from ancient times to the present, with key projects such as a world-class Lighthouse Museum and coastal state pavilions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct and accurately describe the NMHC at Lothal.  The project's development under the Sagarmala Programme, utilizing PPP models, is accurate. Lothal's status as an important IVC site with the world's oldest known dry dock is well-established.  Finally, the NMHC's aim to showcase India's extensive maritime history, as reflected in its planned features, is also accurate. The detailed description in the statements, potentially including less commonly known facts like the Sagarmala Programme and the dry dock's age, is designed to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge.


**4. With reference to the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, decided to include manuscripts of three Indian literary works – Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana – in the register.
2. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  The International Register includes several Indian entries.
3.  The Panchatantra, a collection of Indian fables, is distinguished by its unique “story within story” structure and was written in the 16th Century by Goswami Tulsidas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Statement 3 is incorrect because while the Panchatantra is indeed a collection of Indian fables characterized by its nested narrative structure, it was not written in the 16th century by Goswami Tulsidas.  Goswami Tulsidas authored the Ramcharitmanas, and the Panchatantra's authorship and precise dating are subjects of scholarly debate, but it predates the 16th century significantly. The incorrect information about the authorship and dating of the Panchatantra serves as a strong distractor, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge of the text.  This question tests not only awareness of the MOW programme but also detailed knowledge of classical Indian literature.


**5. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty was a significant part of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside the Bhonsle of Nagpur, Gaekwad of Baroda, and Sindhia of Gwalior.
2.  Malhar Rao Holkar II played a pivotal role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819), and his defeat at the Battle of Mahidpur led to the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818.
3.  Ahilyabai Holkar's rule focused solely on military expansion and conquest, prioritizing the strengthening of the Holkar army and expansion of Holkar territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Holkar Dynasty's position within the Maratha Confederacy and Malhar Rao II's role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War and its outcome.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar was indeed a significant ruler, her reign was characterized not just by military actions but also by significant social and economic reforms, including promoting education for women, supporting widow remarriage, and promoting trade and commerce, particularly the Maheswari weaving industry.  The misleading statement about Ahilyabai's focus solely on military expansion is a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's nuanced understanding of her rule.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victories significantly expanded Chola influence across the Bay of Bengal, including the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra I's military campaigns extended the Chola empire's reach to Southeast Asia, notably encompassing regions of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3.  Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading hub for the Chola Empire, facilitating extensive maritime commerce with Southeast Asian nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I are known for their significant naval conquests, expanding the empire's reach beyond South India. Rajaraja I's campaigns included the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while Rajendra I's expeditions reached Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  These naval victories were instrumental in establishing Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal and facilitating trade with various countries in the region. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading center is well-documented, serving as a vital hub for maritime commerce connecting the Chola Empire to Southeast Asia. Therefore, the correct option is (d), as all three statements are historically accurate.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative, spearheaded by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan, focuses on preserving traditional pastoral farming practices.
2.  Transhumance, a seasonal livestock movement practice, involves the migration of human communities alongside their herds, primarily in mountainous regions.
3.  In 2023, only transhumance traditions from European states received recognition as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is indeed led by ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) and supported by Azerbaijan, aiming to preserve and promote transhumance practices globally. Statement 2 is also correct. Transhumance accurately describes the seasonal migration of pastoral communities with their livestock, a practice prevalent in various parts of the world, including mountainous regions.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While transhumance traditions from 10 European states were recognized, the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland was *also* declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2023.  Therefore, the correct option is (a), encompassing the accurate depictions of the initiative's leadership and the essence of transhumance.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, established in 1992, includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra.
2.  The 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, resulted in the inclusion of 17 works from the Asia-Pacific region, including Indian manuscripts.
3.  The MOW program maintains only an International Register, excluding regional or national registers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of UNESCO's MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  The register does indeed include significant literary works, such as the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra, and the 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar did lead to the inclusion of numerous works, including those from India. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The MOW program maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National.  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is (a), reflecting the accurate information about the inclusion of Indian manuscripts and the location of the MOWCAP meeting.

3.  The T20 World Cup, a premier international Twenty20 cricket championship, was initially launched in 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  South Africa was indeed defeated by India in the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup, which was jointly hosted by the USA and the West Indies. The tournament's inception in 2007 is also a well-established fact. However, statement 1 is incorrect. India won the 2024 T20 World Cup for only its *second* time, not its third.  This makes option (a) the correct answer, highlighting the accurate details regarding the final match and the tournament's launch year while correcting the inaccurate claim about the number of Indian victories.



**5. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1.  The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram signifies the victory of the Indian freedom movement and the A&N Islands' unique contribution.
2.  Sri Vijaya Puram's significance lies in its association with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's unfurling of the Indian flag and the location of the Cellular Jail.
3.  The renaming primarily focuses on erasing the colonial legacy and highlighting the A&N Islands' contemporary strategic role, unrelated to its historical significance as a Chola naval base.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

The new name indeed symbolizes the Indian freedom struggle and the A&N Islands' role in it, with a direct connection to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Cellular Jail.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the renaming does aim to move away from colonial nomenclature, it also explicitly acknowledges the historical significance of the A&N Islands as a naval base for the Chola Empire, thereby linking contemporary strategic importance to its historical past.  Therefore, the correct answer is (a), which accurately captures the primary motivations behind the renaming.


**6. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate descriptions of Project PARI. The project indeed aims to make art more accessible through public installations, and it does include a variety of Indian art forms. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are involved, the first intervention of Project PARI took place in Delhi, not Mumbai.  Therefore, the correct option is (a), accurately reflecting the project's objectives and the range of art forms included, while correcting the inaccuracy regarding the location of the first intervention.


**8. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Tourism launched the 'Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi' initiative to enhance tourist experiences by training local people as tourism ambassadors.

3.  The initiative's vision is to showcase Incredible India through the contributions of Incredible Indians, fostering a welcoming environment for tourists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative.

2.  The GI tag system aims to protect and promote products linked to specific geographical origins, enhancing their market value.
3.  The GI tag system is primarily concerned with protecting the intellectual property rights of individual producers, rather than the geographical identity of products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the role and purpose of the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict aspects of the Virupaksha Temple's history and architecture.  The temple's location in Hampi, its dedication to Lord Virupaksha, and its architectural style are well-established facts.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the architectural features and treasury of the Jagannath Temple. The presence of the Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa is well-documented, along with the Ratna Bhandar's two chambers.  However, statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the outer walls do depict various forms of Vishnu, the inner sanctum houses multiple deities—Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra—not a single monolithic statue. Therefore, the correct option is (a), reflecting the accurate information about the temple's architectural components and the treasury while correcting the inaccuracy about the inner sanctum's contents.


**14. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IOA, formed in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first president, coordinates with National Sports Federations to send teams to international games.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  Many megalithic structures exhibit variations in their construction and burial practices. Statement 2 is incorrect because while chamber tombs are a significant type of megalith, unchambered tombs and other megalithic structures not directly associated with burials also exist.  Statement 3 is correct. While some groups associated with megalithic sites practiced semi-nomadic pastoralism,  it's inaccurate to generalize this to all such groups.  The diversity of cultures and practices across different regions and time periods associated with megalithic sites needs to be acknowledged.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The question highlights the need for nuanced understanding of archaeological findings, avoiding generalizations about complex historical realities.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola did conduct significant naval expeditions and achieved victories, the text specifies his destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandya dynasty was another prominent power in South India, and while conflicts likely occurred, the text doesn't support this specific claim about Rajaraja.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Rajendra I launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the extent of Chola naval power and reach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the island becoming a *Chola province*, implying complete control, not merely a vassal state.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text confirms the inclusion of the Panchatantra in the register and specifies that it was included alongside 17 other works from the region at the 10th MOWCAP meeting held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text mentions Sahṛdayāloka-Locana as an included work, it was included in the *Asia-Pacific Regional Register*, not the *International Register*.  The statement incorrectly assigns it to the International Register, a significant factual error.  The distinction between regional and international registers is crucial for understanding the scope of UNESCO's recognition.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The text states that the handloom industry is India's largest cottage industry and that 70% of weavers and allied workers are women. However, the statement is misleading by claiming the industry is the second largest employment provider in rural areas.  While it is a significant employer, the text does not provide data to support this claim as the second largest.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that the first National Handloom Day was celebrated in 2015, not 2010. This is a crucial factual error that invalidates the statement. The correct year is essential for accurate historical context.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes Lothal's location and its significance as a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the discovery of the oldest man-made dry dock at Lothal and its implications for understanding the nautical knowledge of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the NMHC is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme in a *Public-Private Partnership (PPP)* mode, not solely as a privately funded project.  This misrepresentation of the funding model is a crucial factual error.  The distinction between public and private funding is important for understanding the project's governance and resource allocation.


**12. With reference to  Swami Vivekananda's contributions and legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which engages in various forms of social service, including running hospitals and educational institutions.
2.  Swami Vivekananda’s address at the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 significantly influenced the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Bangalore.
3. Swami Vivekananda primarily preached the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, rejecting the Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita systems as heretical interpretations of Vedanta.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes Swami Vivekananda's establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 and its engagement in social service activities.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  While Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of Religions was influential, the text states that he *inspired* Jamsetji Tata to establish the IISC, not that it directly *influenced* its establishment. The subtle difference in wording is important. The inspiration may have been one factor among many in the founding of the IISC.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions that Swami Vivekananda preached Vedanta philosophy, and that Vedanta *incorporates* Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita, and Dvaita systems. The statement incorrectly suggests that Swami Vivekananda rejected the latter two systems, which is not supported by the text.  The misrepresentation of his philosophical stance is a significant inaccuracy.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly describes the Bharat Ratna as India's highest civilian award, granted by the President for outstanding service.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that recommendations are made by the Prime Minister of India to the President and that *no formal recommendations* are necessary.  The statement erroneously introduces a formal committee, contradicting the text.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the award components: a Sanad signed by the President, a medallion, and the absence of any monetary grant.  The accurate description of the award’s features is important.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola king Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, conquering several regions in the process.
2.  The Chera navy was decisively defeated by Rajaraja I at a naval battle near Kandalursalai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra I significantly expanded Chola naval power, leading to conquests in Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion is well-documented in Chola inscriptions and historical accounts.

Statement 2 is also correct. Rajaraja I's victory at Kandalursalai is a significant event in Chola history, marking a major triumph over the Chera navy and solidifying Chola dominance in the region.  Sources such as Chola inscriptions provide evidence for this naval battle and its outcome.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Rajaraja I's conquest of Sri Lanka led to the annexation of a significant portion of the island, including its northern parts, making it a Chola province.  Historical records and inscriptions point to the incorporation of a substantial part of Sri Lanka under Chola rule, contradicting the statement's claim of only partial annexation.  The extent of Chola control might have fluctuated over time, but the initial conquest involved more than just the southern region.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance practices are limited to the Himalayan region, primarily involving nomadic tribes like the Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis.
2. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland, a transhumance tradition, was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2023.
3. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), with support from India, leads the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it's also practiced in other regions of India, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly restricts the practice to only the Himalayan region and specific tribes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland was indeed recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2023, showcasing the global significance of this traditional practice.  This recognition by UNESCO is a matter of public record.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is led by ICOMOS, but it is supported by Azerbaijan, not India.  The source of funding and support for such initiatives is typically well documented by the organizations involved.

3. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes works from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, not solely from India.  The inclusion of diverse works reflects the program's aim to preserve global documentary heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ramcharitmanas, written in the 16th century, is indeed included in the register, but the statement incorrectly states it as a 17th-century work.  The precise dating of literary works is a matter of scholarly consensus and often subject to debate.

Statement 3 is correct. The MoW Programme operates with three distinct registers, allowing for categorization and management of documentary heritage at various levels (international, regional, and national).  This structure is fundamental to the operation of the MoW Programme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Abhaya Mudra symbolizes fearlessness, it is associated with Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Dhyani Buddha, not Vairocana, the first Dhyani Buddha.  The specific iconography and symbolism of different Buddhas are well-established in Buddhist art and literature.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhumisparsha Mudra (earth-touching gesture) depicts the Buddha calling upon the earth to witness his triumph over Mara, the personification of temptation and delusion, during his enlightenment. This is a well-known and widely accepted interpretation of the mudra.

Statement 3 is correct. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra (turning the wheel of dharma) represents the Buddha's first sermon at Sarnath, marking the beginning of the propagation of the Dharma (Buddha's teachings).  This symbolism is central to Buddhist iconography and understanding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A primary objective of the CPA is to streamline the process of seizing and returning illicitly trafficked Indian antiquities to India.  This is a key aspect of the agreement, designed to enhance international cooperation in protecting cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CPA does not restrict the importation of *all* archaeological and ethnological materials.  It targets specific categories of materials deemed to be of significant cultural importance and at risk of illicit trafficking.  The agreement is selective in its scope, focusing on high-risk items.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention indeed provides a crucial international framework for collaboration among nations in preventing the illegal trade of cultural property.  This convention serves as a cornerstone of international law in this domain.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project PARI is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Culture, Lalit Kala Akademi, and the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), not the National Museum of Modern Art.  The collaboration leverages the expertise of these organizations in promoting visual arts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The project focuses on public art installations in urban landscapes, not primarily rural areas.  The aim is to make art more accessible to urban populations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Project PARI's first intervention was in Delhi, not Mumbai.  The location of the initial project is a matter of public record and easily verifiable.


**8. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated by the Prime Minister, is located near the ruins of the ancient Nalanda University in Varanasi.
2. The establishment of Nalanda University was based on a decision made at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.

2.  Standardized weights and measures were used in the Indus Valley Civilization, indicating a sophisticated system of trade and commerce.
3.  The "Mother Goddess" and "Pasupati" are prominent deities depicted in Indus art, suggesting a polytheistic religious belief system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus script remains undeciphered, preventing a complete understanding of their writing system and its contents.  The inability to decipher the script limits our knowledge of their language, religious practices, and social structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The use of standardized weights and measures is well-documented in Indus Valley Civilization sites, suggesting a level of economic organization and trade that facilitated efficient commerce within and possibly beyond the region.

Statement 3 is correct.  The "Mother Goddess" and "Pasupati" (often interpreted as a proto-Shiva figure) are frequently depicted in Indus art, indicating the presence of prominent deities and suggesting a polytheistic or at least a complex religious system.  The iconography of these figures is a significant aspect of Indus culture.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vijayanagara Empire's territory extended across present-day Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, but not beyond.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas were appointed by the Raya (king) as military commanders and given territories to govern.
3.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked a significant decline in the empire's power and territorial extent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's influence extended beyond present-day Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, reaching parts of present-day Telangana, and even influencing regions further south and west.  The empire's territorial reach varied over time, but it was far more extensive than the statement suggests.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amara-Nayakas were indeed military commanders appointed by the Raya, given control over specific territories, and responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining their respective regions.  This decentralized administrative system was a key feature of the Vijayanagara Empire.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Krishnadevaraya's reign is considered a period of the empire's zenith, not decline.  His rule saw significant territorial expansion and cultural flourishing.  The statement misrepresents the historical significance of Krishnadevaraya's reign.


**11.  Consider the following statements about the Kalinga Dynasty:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) led to the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire and Emperor Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism.
2. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is known for his patronage of Jainism and his military campaigns documented in the Hathigumpha inscription.
3.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, built during the Gupta period, are significant examples of rock-cut cave architecture in Odisha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kalinga War is a pivotal event in Indian history, resulting in the Mauryan Empire's conquest of Kalinga and Ashoka's subsequent conversion to Buddhism, profoundly influencing his subsequent reign.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and his military achievements, detailed in the Hathigumpha inscription, are well-established aspects of his reign.  The inscription provides valuable insights into Kalinga's history and Kharavela's role.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are significant rock-cut caves in Odisha, they were built during the reign of King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty around the 2nd century BCE, not during the Gupta period.  The chronological attribution of these caves is a well-established fact in art history.


**12. With reference to the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site showcasing dolmenoid cists, chamber tombs that are fully subterranean.
2.  The rock art sites at Damaratogu feature depictions of animals, humans, and weapons, typical of the region's megalithic art.
3.  Devarlabanda Mula is characterized by depictions of animals only, lacking human or weapon representations, which is unusual for the region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site, the description of dolmenoid cists as fully subterranean is inaccurate. Dolmenoid cists are typically semi-subterranean, not completely underground.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The rock art at Damaratogu is unusual in that it primarily depicts animals and lacks human or weapon representations.  This is contrary to the statement's claim of typical depictions of animals, humans, and weapons.

Statement 3 is correct. The unique characteristic of Devarlabanda Mula's rock art—the absence of human or weapon representations—is an unusual feature for the region, making it an archaeologically significant site.  The unique nature of this site is highlighted in archaeological reports.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I resulted in the island becoming a tributary state, not a full province.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While Rajaraja Chola I did conduct significant naval expeditions and achieved many victories, the provided text mentions the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. This detail is crucial for accuracy.  The core fact that Rajaraja I led successful naval campaigns remains true.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states Rajendra Chola I's successful naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, leading to the conquest of areas in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates Chola naval power and their extensive reach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Rajendra Chola I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province, not merely a tributary state. This highlights the extent of Chola dominance and territorial control.

Therefore, only statements 1 (with the correction of Chera for Pandya) and 2 are correct.

3.  The seasonal movement of livestock in transhumance involves migration to higher altitudes during winter and lower altitudes during summer.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions the prevalence of transhumance in the Himalayas, it also explicitly states that this system exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  This demonstrates that transhumance is not limited to the Himalayan region.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The text mentions that the listed tribes rear sheep and goats, not cattle.  The specific type of livestock is a significant detail.  The statement is misleading by including cattle, a common livestock but not the one specified.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that animals are moved to subalpine and alpine pastures during *summer*, and grazed on adjoining plains during *winter*. The statement reverses the seasonal movement.

Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts are the only Indian works included in the register.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that these three Indian works were included *along with 17 other works from the region*.  This implies that there are more than just these three Indian entries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that the MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. The location is a critical detail.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that the MoW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  This is a direct and accurate statement.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes dolmenoid cists as semi-subterranean chamber tombs.  It does not restrict their location to South India, nor does it state that they are exclusively above-ground structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions megalithic origins in the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, indicating a broader timeframe than just the Neolithic period.  The inclusion of the Chalcolithic period is a crucial piece of information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions that the Hire Benkal site is *under consideration* for the tentative list of UNESCO, implying it is not yet officially on the World Heritage List.  The status of the site is a key differentiating factor.

Therefore, none of the statements are correct.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Phanigiri is a *Buddhist* site, not a Hindu site, located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad. The religious affiliation is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that the thorana's panel at Phanigiri shows the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects. This illustrates religious diversity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text mentions Satavahana inscriptions, it states that the coin hoard belongs to the *Ikshvaku* period, not the Satavahana period.  The specific time period is crucial for accurate historical understanding.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1. Bavikonda Monastery dates back to the 3rd century CE.
2.  The monastery is a Theravada Buddhist complex featuring a Mahastupa and Chaitya Griha.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that Bavikonda Monastery dates back to the 3rd century *BCE*, not CE. The difference between BCE and CE is a significant chronological distinction.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the monastery as a Theravada Buddhist complex with structures including a Mahastupa and Chaitya Griha.  This description aligns with the historical record.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Bavikonda Monastery is part of the mentioned Buddhist Circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.  This detail is directly provided in the text.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori*, and that it is reared *indoors*, not outdoors.  Both the silkworm species and rearing method are crucial distinctions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes Eri silk as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to exit the cocoon naturally.  This characteristic is a key defining feature.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India produces *all five* types of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tropical & Temperate Tasar, and Muga.  The number of silk types is a significant detail.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

3. The Chola conquest of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I resulted in the island becoming a Chola province for a brief period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval power and engaged in numerous naval battles, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandyas were another significant power in South India, and while conflicts likely occurred, the specific detail given in the source points to the Cheras.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Rajendra I's major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, leading to the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This reflects the significant reach of Chola naval power.

Statement 3 is partially correct but needs clarification. While Rajendra I did conquer Sri Lanka,  the text doesn't explicitly state it became a permanent Chola province. It suggests it became a province, implying some level of control, but not necessarily a long-lasting, fully integrated part of the empire.  The phrasing is nuanced and doesn't definitively support the claim of permanent annexation. Therefore, while the statement contains an element of truth, it is not entirely accurate in its presentation.  The careful wording of the option makes it the most accurate choice.


**2. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem in Awadhi, is among the Indian literary works included in the register.
2. The Panchatantra, an ancient collection of Sanskrit fables, is included in the register alongside 17 other works from the Asia-Pacific region.
3. The Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, a text of Indian poetics written by Abhinava Gupta, is one of the three Indian literary works included in the register.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the *Ramcharitmanas* was written in the 16th century, not the 17th century, by Goswami Tulsidas.  This seemingly small chronological error makes the statement factually incorrect for UPSC-level accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately reflects the inclusion of the Panchatantra in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register alongside other works.  The number of works and the regional context are correctly stated.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text attributes the authorship of Sahṛdayāloka-Locana to Acharya Anandvardhan, not Abhinava Gupta. Abhinava Gupta is mentioned as writing a commentary on the work, but not as its author.  Confusing the author with the commentator is a common error, making this a good distractor in a UPSC-style question.


**3. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1.  The museum, inaugurated in 2021, commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.
2.  Located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, it houses one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.
3. The museum is situated near Bhujio Fort, built in 1724 by Rao Jodha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the museum was inaugurated in 2022, not 2021.  A one-year difference might seem minor, but such precision is critical in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The description accurately places the museum on Bhujiyo Dungar hill and highlights the presence of a large Miyawaki forest.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the museum is near Bhujio Fort, the text specifies the fort was built in 1723, not 1724, by Rao Godji, not Rao Jodha.  Mixing up the year and the name of the builder are effective distractors.  The slight inaccuracies make this an excellent question for testing precise factual recall.


**4. With reference to the International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2015 to raise global awareness of yoga's benefits.
2.  India's proposal for IYD received endorsement from over 170 member states of the UN.
3. Yoga, one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, finds its systematic reference in Patanjali's Yogasutra, dating back to the 1st century BC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, not 2015.  Again, a seemingly small detail makes a significant difference in the accuracy of the statement.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not precise enough. While the text mentions record endorsement from 175 member states, the statement claims "over 170."  While technically true, the imprecision makes it less desirable than a more accurate statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text dates Patanjali's Yogasutra to the 2nd century BC, not the 1st century BC. This subtle chronological inaccuracy is a common distractor tactic in UPSC questions testing detailed knowledge.  The imprecise nature of statement 2 and the outright inaccuracy of statement 3 make option (a) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The fellowship, conferred by the Sahitya Akademi, is awarded annually to writers for their lifetime contributions.
2.  Ruskin Bond was awarded the fellowship for his significant contributions to Indian literature and his works like "Vagrants in the Valley" and "Once Upon a Monsoon Time."
3.  The fellowship is considered the highest honor conferred by the Akademi, reserved for writers who have made an exceptional and lasting impact on literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text doesn't state that the fellowship is awarded *annually*. It highlights that it is the highest honor, but doesn't specify the frequency of award.  This creates a plausible distractor, as many awards are annual.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Ruskin Bond's receipt of the fellowship and cites some of his major literary works.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the fellowship as the highest honor and implies its selective nature, reserved for writers with a significant and lasting impact. The description emphasizes the exceptional nature of the award.  The combination of a partially correct statement and two fully correct statements makes this a challenging but fair question.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval conquests included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's reign saw the complete annexation of Sri Lanka as a Chola province.
3. The Chola Empire's naval power extended its influence primarily to the Arabian Sea, facilitating trade with West Asian countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's successful naval campaigns led to the complete subjugation of Sri Lanka, making it a Chola province.  This is a well-documented fact in Chola history.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did engage in significant naval warfare, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai. This is a crucial detail that differentiates the correct answer from a potentially misleading option.  Confusing the Pandya and Chera kingdoms is a common error, making this a good distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chola Empire's naval dominance was primarily focused on the Bay of Bengal, enabling trade with Southeast Asia, not the Arabian Sea.  The question subtly shifts the geographical focus to create a plausible, yet inaccurate, statement. This highlights the importance of precise geographical knowledge in understanding historical events.  The mention of a "Look East Policy" in the source material further emphasizes the Chola's focus on the Bay of Bengal.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a practice primarily confined to mountainous regions, with limited presence in plains.
2. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is spearheaded by UNESCO and supported by India.
3.  Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes in India practicing transhumance, primarily rearing sheep and goats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions these tribes and their practice of transhumance involving sheep and goat rearing.  This statement is straightforward and directly verifiable from the source.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, the text also mentions its existence in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  This statement falsely restricts the practice to mountainous areas, a common misconception.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), not UNESCO, leads the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, with support from Azerbaijan, not India.  This statement interchanges key organizations and countries, creating a deceptive distractor. The detail about the supporting country is a crucial differentiating factor.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts were included in the MOW International Register.
2. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Beijing, China.
3. The MOW programme was launched in 1997.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is wrong because the text clearly states that the mentioned manuscripts were included in the *Asia-Pacific Regional Register*, not the International Register. This plays on the subtle difference between regional and international classifications.

Statement 2 is wrong because the text specifies that the 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This is a geographically specific detail that serves as a strong distractor.

Statement 3 is wrong as the text states the MOW programme was launched in 1992, not 1997.  The five-year difference is a small but significant detail that makes this a plausible yet incorrect option.  The seemingly minor error in the year creates a challenging question.


**4. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is located near the ancient ruins in Varanasi.
2.  The ancient Nalanda University was primarily known for its expertise in Vedic studies and  Jain philosophies, alongside Buddhism.
3. The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was taken at the 1st East Asia Summit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new campus is located in Rajgir, Bihar, not Varanasi. This involves a significant geographical error, making it a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nalanda was indeed a center for Buddhist studies (including Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), the statement overemphasizes Vedic and Jain philosophies and downplays the central role of Buddhism. The question cleverly uses the inclusion of "primarily known for" to mislead.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The decision was made at the *2nd*, not the 1st, East Asia Summit. This seemingly minor numerical error is a key element in making the question challenging.  The seemingly minor difference between the 1st and 2nd summit creates a good distractor.


**5. With reference to the  Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Kumargupta II founded Nalanda University in the 6th century CE.
2. The library at Nalanda, known as "Dharma Gunj," held over five million books.
3.  Aryabhata, a renowned astronomer and mathematician, is believed to have studied at Takshashila, not Nalanda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. While Aryabhata was a significant figure in ancient Indian mathematics and astronomy, the text does not mention him studying at Nalanda. Attributing him to Takshashila, another renowned ancient university, creates a plausible distractor.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kumargupta *I*, not Kumargupta II, founded Nalanda University. The subtle difference in the ruler's number is a key detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the library held over *nine* million books, not five million.  This numerical discrepancy is another subtle detail that makes the question more difficult.  The difference between five and nine million is a significant numerical change.
