**1. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains a single, comprehensive register of globally significant documentary heritage.
2.  The International Register under the MoW Programme includes entries solely focused on Western literary and historical documents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, actually maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National. This multi-tiered approach allows for a more nuanced categorization and preservation of documentary heritage across different geographical and cultural contexts.  The existence of multiple registers highlights the programme's commitment to inclusivity and the recognition of diverse cultural significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The International Register of the MoW Programme is far from exclusively focused on Western documents.  The provided text explicitly mentions Indian entries such as the Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection, Saiva manuscripts, and the Rig Veda. This demonstrates the programme's global scope and its intention to preserve and promote a broad spectrum of documentary heritage, including significant contributions from non-Western cultures.  The inclusion of diverse materials underscores the programme's commitment to a more holistic and representative understanding of global history and culture.  The fact that various Indian texts are specifically named refutes the claim of Western exclusivity.


**2. With reference to the literary works mentioned, consider the following statements:**

1.  The *Ramcharitmanas*, written in Sanskrit, is a poetic retelling of the *Mahabharata* epic.
2.  The *Panchatantra* is renowned for its unique "story within a story" narrative structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The *Ramcharitmanas*, while a poetic retelling of a significant epic, is specifically a retelling of the *Ramayana*, not the *Mahabharata*.  The confusion might stem from the familiarity of both epics within Indian literature, but they are distinct narratives with different central characters and storylines.  Accurate knowledge of the specific epic retold is crucial for a correct answer.

Statement 2 is correct. The *Panchatantra* is indeed celebrated for its distinctive "story within a story" structure. This nested narrative technique is a key element of its storytelling style and contributes significantly to its enduring appeal and complexity.  The "story within a story" framework is a significant feature that sets the *Panchatantra* apart from other fable collections.


**3. With reference to Acharya Anandvardhan's work, consider the following statements:**

1.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is a text on Indian music, composed in Pali.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is a text of Indian poetics, not music.  The subject matter is crucial to understanding the work's significance within the broader context of Indian literary and philosophical traditions. Second, the language of *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is Sanskrit, not Pali.  The distinction between Sanskrit and Pali highlights the different linguistic and cultural contexts within which these languages developed and the literary traditions they represent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Abhinavagupta wrote a commentary on *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, he did not author the original text.  Acharya Anandvardhan is the author of the original work.  Attributing authorship correctly demonstrates a precise understanding of the text's intellectual lineage and the contributions of different scholars.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honour conferred by the Akademi. The fellowship is not awarded annually to multiple writers but is reserved for a select few, reflecting its prestigious nature and the exceptionally high standards it represents.  The limited number of recipients underscores the significance of the award and its role in recognizing lifetime achievement in literature.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha descended from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka (celestial realm) to Sankassiya, not the day he attained enlightenment.  The two events, while both significant in Buddhist history, are distinct.  Precise knowledge of the event commemorated is essential for understanding the significance of IAD.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), does observe IAD. This collaboration highlights the importance of cultural preservation and the promotion of Buddhist heritage.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The distinction between monastic rules and philosophical doctrines is crucial for understanding the structure and content of the Tipitaka.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sutta Pitaka is indeed the largest part of the Tipitaka and contains a vast collection of discourses and sermons attributed to the Buddha, along with some religious poetry.  The Sutta Pitaka provides a rich source of information about the Buddha's teachings and the development of Buddhist thought.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar's father was Mankoji Rao Shinde, not Malhar Rao Holkar.  Malhar Rao Holkar was her father-in-law and the founder of the Holkar dynasty. Ahilyabai assumed power after the deaths of both her husband, Khanderao Holkar, and her father-in-law.  This detail highlights the complexities of succession and power dynamics within the Maratha Confederacy. The statement incorrectly conflates the roles of father and father-in-law, a common source of confusion in understanding Maratha history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom dynasty was a monarchy, the king's power was not absolute.  A significant council of ministers, the *Patra Mantris*, played a crucial role in governance.  The king's appointments and decisions were often subject to their concurrence. This demonstrates a more nuanced political structure than a simple autocracy, reflecting the complex power-sharing arrangements within the Ahom administration. The statement incorrectly portrays the Ahom political system as an absolute monarchy, overlooking the vital role of the ministerial council.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ahom dynasty actively embraced and promoted Shaivism and the Shakti movement. Their patronage is clearly seen in the reconstruction and maintenance of numerous temples across Assam, with the Kamakhya Devi Temple being a prominent example. This highlights the dynasty's religious policies and their impact on the religious landscape of Assam.  The Kamakhya Devi Temple's continued importance today underlines the lasting legacy of Ahom patronage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Works such as *Tolkappiyam*, *Ettuthokai*, and *Pathuppattu* are considered foundational texts of Tamil literature, providing invaluable insights into the society, culture, and worldview of the period. The mention of these specific works demonstrates a precise understanding of the Sangam literary canon.  These texts remain significant for understanding early Tamil civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Varna system was known to Sangam poets,  the social structure of the Sangam Age was not a rigid, monolithic caste system precisely mirroring the Vedic Varna system.  The social hierarchy was more fluid and complex, with evidence suggesting greater social mobility than often portrayed.  The statement oversimplifies the complex social dynamics of the Sangam Age, presenting a simplified and potentially inaccurate reflection of its social structure.  Scholarly debate continues on the precise nature and rigidity of social stratification during the Sangam period.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Harappan Civilization:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization primarily used copper, with limited evidence of bronze usage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harappan Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization, showcasing significant advancements in metallurgy and widespread use of bronze in tools, weaponry, and other artifacts. The statement erroneously downplays the importance of bronze in the Harappan context, suggesting a limited understanding of their technological capabilities. While copper was also used, bronze was a defining material of their technology.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Harappan script remains undeciphered, but its pictographic nature and the boustrophedon writing style (alternating directions) are established characteristics.  This demonstrates knowledge of the script's visual form and its unique writing conventions.  The fact that the script is undeciphered does not negate the knowledge of its visual characteristics, which are important for understanding its potential meaning and relationship to other ancient scripts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Raya held supreme authority, the Vijayanagara Empire's administration wasn't solely centralized.  The *Amara-Nayakas*, powerful military commanders who governed assigned territories, played a crucial role. They collected taxes, retained a portion of the revenue, and maintained their own armies. This highlights a decentralized aspect of the empire's governance, showing a complex interplay between central authority and regional autonomy.  The statement presents an oversimplified view of the empire's complex administrative structure.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is indeed marked by significant territorial expansion. His conquests included the strategically important Raichur Doab and notable victories against Orissa and the Sultanate of Bijapur. This demonstrates his military prowess and the empire's expansionist ambitions.  The mention of specific territorial gains and military opponents reflects a detailed understanding of Krishnadevaraya's reign.  These military achievements are crucial for understanding the empire's geopolitical position and its power projection.

The statement incorrectly simplifies the program's organizational structure.  The existence of multiple registers allows for a more nuanced approach to preserving documentary heritage, catering to different geographical and thematic contexts.

Statement 2 is correct.  Manuscripts of the three Indian literary works mentioned—*Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*—have been recognized and included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This highlights the international recognition of these works and their importance within the broader context of Asian documentary heritage.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2550th Bhagwan Mahaveer Nirvan Mahotsav commemorates the *nirvana* (death and liberation) of Bhagwan Mahaveer, not his birth anniversary.  The statement incorrectly identifies the event's purpose, confusing the commemoration of nirvana with the celebration of birth.  The specific reference to the Nirvan Mahotsav indicates a precise understanding of the event's significance within Jainism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Bhagwan Mahavir's teachings are indeed central to Jain philosophy, emphasizing principles of non-violence (Ahimsa), right conduct, and the path towards spiritual liberation (Moksha).  This core tenet of Jainism is fundamental to understanding the religion's ethical and spiritual framework.  The mention of key concepts like Ahimsa and Moksha demonstrates a clear understanding of Jain philosophy.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode (Calicut) is situated on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast.  The statement incorrectly identifies the geographical location, potentially confusing two important coastal regions of India.  The distinction between the Malabar and Coromandel coasts is crucial for understanding the historical geography of India.

Statement 2 is correct. Kozhikode's designation as India's first UNESCO City of Literature is indeed a recognition of its significant literary heritage and contributions to literature.  This highlights the city's cultural richness and its place within the global literary landscape.  The specific mention of UNESCO recognition demonstrates an accurate understanding of the city's cultural status.

The inclusion of both temples within the Hampi group, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, further underscores their significance in understanding the artistic and architectural achievements of the Vijayanagara Empire.


**2. With reference to the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangam literature extensively details the social structure of Varna, reflecting its rigid hierarchical organization.
2.  The earliest known work of Sangam literature is the Tolkappiyam, a comprehensive treatise on Tamil grammar and poetics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sangam literature does mention the Varna system, it doesn't portray it as rigidly hierarchical as later texts.  The social structure depicted is more nuanced, reflecting a complex interplay of various social groups and hierarchies, which were not solely defined by the Varna system. The Sangam poems often emphasize other social divisions and classifications alongside Varna.  Furthermore, the portrayal of social relations in Sangam literature is often fluid and context-dependent, challenging a simplistic interpretation of a rigid caste system.  Statement 2 is correct. The Tolkappiyam is considered the earliest extant work of Sangam literature and serves as a fundamental text for understanding early Tamil grammar and poetics.  Its detailed analysis of language structure and literary forms provides invaluable insights into the intellectual and linguistic landscape of the Sangam Age. Its age and comprehensive nature make it a cornerstone of Tamil literary history and a crucial source for scholars studying the evolution of the Tamil language and its literary traditions.


**3. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, the queen of Malwa, is primarily known for her patronage of arts and reconstruction of numerous temples, including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
2.  Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War led to the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly altering the Holkar's relationship with the British East India Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign is celebrated for her significant contributions to temple reconstruction and her patronage of arts and literature.  Her restoration efforts revitalized several important religious sites, including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, a prominent Jyotirlinga in Varanasi.  Her patronage extended to various scholars and artists, highlighting her commitment to cultural preservation and development.  Her rule also saw economic progress in Malwa, showcasing her administrative skills.  Similarly, the Third Anglo-Maratha War witnessed Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat at the Battle of Mahidpur.  The subsequent Treaty of Mandsaur (1818) significantly reshaped the power dynamics between the Holkar Dynasty and the British East India Company, marking a turning point in the dynasty's history and leading to the Holkars' diminished autonomy. The treaty's terms imposed restrictions on the Holkar's sovereignty and established British dominance in the region.


**4. With reference to the Buddhist universities of ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University, renowned for its vast library and scholarly contributions, was located in present-day Bihar.
2. Vikramshila University, known for its focus on Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism, was established by Dharmapala, a Pala dynasty ruler.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nalanda University, a globally recognized center of learning, was situated in present-day Bihar. Its extensive library and the presence of renowned scholars established it as a leading institution for Buddhist studies and other intellectual pursuits. The university attracted students and scholars from across Asia, reflecting its global reputation and significance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Vikramshila University was indeed a prominent center for Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism, it was established by King Dharmapala, a Pala Dynasty ruler, not by a ruler named simply "Dharmapala".  This subtle but significant difference in the name makes the statement factually incorrect, highlighting the importance of precise historical details.  The university’s reputation for advanced Buddhist studies and its contributions to Buddhist scholarship are well-documented, but the name of the founder needs to be precisely stated.


**5.  With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1.  The famine, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," occurred during the ninth regnal year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva.
2.  The construction of the Puri Canal, connecting the Hooghly River to the River Matai, was a direct consequence of the famine's devastating impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka" famine, coincided with the ninth year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva's reign. This chronological detail is significant in understanding the historical context of the famine.  The famine's devastating impact prompted significant infrastructural developments, including the construction of the Puri Canal. This canal, connecting the Hooghly River in West Bengal to the River Matai in Odisha, aimed to improve irrigation and reduce the region's vulnerability to future famines.  The canal's construction, therefore, stands as a direct response to the crisis and a testament to the need for infrastructural improvements to mitigate the effects of such calamities.  The famine's legacy extends beyond the immediate crisis, shaping subsequent administrative policies and infrastructural projects in the region.


**6. With reference to the Battle of Saragarhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The battle was fought between a small contingent of 21 Sikh soldiers from the 36th Sikh Regiment and a significantly larger force of Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Saragarhi is renowned for its extraordinary display of courage by a small band of 21 Sikh soldiers who valiantly defended their post against a vastly superior force of Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen, numbering over 8,000.  Their heroic stand against overwhelming odds is a testament to their bravery and loyalty.  The battle's significance extends beyond its military aspects, becoming a symbol of courage and sacrifice. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Saragarhi was indeed a crucial communication post, it was located on the Samana Range in present-day *Pakistan*, not Afghanistan. This geographical detail is essential for accurate historical understanding and pinpoints the precise location of the battle within the broader context of the Tirah campaign. The error in the location highlights the importance of precise geographical knowledge in historical analysis.


**7. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

2.  The civilization encompassed a vast geographical area, extending across present-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and is characterized by its advanced urban planning and sophisticated craftsmanship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While John Marshall played a significant role in the subsequent research and dissemination of information about the Harappan Civilization, the initial discovery at Harappa was made in 1921 by Daya Ram Sahni, not John Marshall in 1924.  Marshall’s announcement in 1924 was a significant milestone in bringing the civilization to wider attention, but it wasn't the initial discovery.  The timeline of the discovery is crucial for accurate historical representation.  Statement 2 is correct. The Harappan Civilization's vast geographical extent across present-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan is a testament to its scale and influence.  Its advanced urban planning, including sophisticated drainage systems and standardized brick sizes, and its remarkable craftsmanship, as evidenced by its intricate seals and pottery, are hallmarks of its advanced technological and artistic capabilities. The civilization's sophistication and widespread influence continue to fascinate archaeologists and historians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja I's naval power extended far beyond the Coromandel Coast.  His conquests included Sri Lanka and expeditions to the Maldives, demonstrating a reach far exceeding simple coastal control.  Rajaraja I's naval power was instrumental in establishing Chola hegemony over the Bay of Bengal and parts of Southeast Asia.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chola navy's control of the Bay of Bengal was crucial for their extensive trade network with Southeast Asia. This maritime dominance allowed for safe passage of goods and facilitated the empire's significant economic growth through trade in spices, textiles, and other valuable commodities.  Nagapattinam served as a key trading center, highlighting the economic importance of their naval prowess.  The statement accurately reflects the symbiotic relationship between Chola naval power and their economic prosperity.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative, spearheaded by UNESCO, aims to preserve traditional pastoralist practices across the globe, focusing primarily on the cultural aspects of transhumance.
2.  The transhumance landscapes of India, particularly in the Himalayas and plains, are characterized by the seasonal movement of nomadic tribes, such as the Gujars and Bakarwals, who primarily rear cattle.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative does aim to preserve traditional pastoralist practices, it's led by ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites), not UNESCO, and supported by Azerbaijan. The focus is broader than just cultural aspects; it also encompasses the preservation of transhumance landscapes and associated heritage.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description accurately reflects the traditional transhumance practices in India.  The Himalayan and plains regions are indeed home to various nomadic tribes who engage in seasonal livestock movements, with Gujars and Bakarwals being prominent examples.  The statement correctly identifies the animals reared (sheep and goats) and the seasonal migration patterns.


**3. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument solely on its physical condition, with monuments deemed structurally unsound or beyond repair automatically facing delisting.
2.  The delisting of a monument under the AMASR Act, 1958, automatically removes all legal protections afforded to it, allowing unrestricted construction and development activities on the site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI's decision to delist a monument is not solely based on its physical condition.  The assessment also considers the national importance of the monument.  If a monument is deemed to lack national importance, it may be delisted even if it's in relatively good condition.  The "untraceable" status of some monuments played a role in the delisting decision, indicating factors beyond mere physical state were considered.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While delisting removes ASI's conservation and protection responsibilities, it doesn't automatically grant free rein for construction and development.  Other legal frameworks and regulations might still apply depending on zoning laws, environmental concerns, and other relevant legislation. The statement oversimplifies the legal implications of delisting.


**4. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government-led initiative aimed at enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by implementing strict quality control measures enforced through centralized government regulation.
2.  The initiative utilizes blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of Kasturi Cotton, promoting transparency and consumer trust.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the goal is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton, the initiative works on the principle of self-regulation by ginners, not centralized government enforcement.  The initiative involves collaboration between the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry, indicating a collaborative approach rather than strict, top-down control.

Statement 2 is correct.  Blockchain technology is a core component of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  It's used to ensure complete traceability and certification of the cotton, providing transparency and building consumer trust in the quality and origin of the product.  This technological aspect is crucial for the initiative's success.


**5. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI is a Ministry of Culture initiative executed by the National Museum, aiming to promote contemporary Indian art through public installations in major metropolitan areas across India.
2.  The project's artistic scope is limited to large-scale sculptures and installations, excluding other art forms like paintings and murals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum.  While it aims to promote Indian art through public installations, its scope includes a wide range of metropolitan areas, not limited to major cities only.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The project's artistic scope is diverse, encompassing various art forms such as paintings, murals, sculptures, and traditional art forms like Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, and Alpana art. The statement incorrectly restricts the types of art included.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Saluva dynasty, known for its strong centralized administration, marked the peak of the Vijayanagara Empire's power and territorial expansion.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas, powerful military commanders, were granted territories to rule but were directly accountable to the Raya (king) for all matters of governance and taxation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tuluva dynasty, not the Saluva dynasty, is associated with the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire's power and territorial expansion. The Saluva dynasty came to power after the decline of the Sangama dynasty, but it did not reach the same level of territorial control as the Tuluva dynasty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Amara-Nayakas were granted territories and collected taxes, they retained a portion of the revenue for their personal use and maintenance of their forces and infrastructure.  This degree of autonomy suggests they weren't directly accountable to the Raya for all matters.  The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between the Raya and the Amara-Nayakas.



**7. With reference to the outcome of the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha directly led to the immediate abolishment of untouchability throughout Travancore.
2.  The movement's success was met with unanimous support from all social groups within Travancore, solidifying social harmony in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha didn't lead to the immediate abolishment of untouchability. While it achieved a significant legal victory granting access to lower-caste individuals to certain temple roads, the practice of untouchability persisted. The movement was a step towards social reform, but it didn't eradicate untouchability entirely.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha didn't enjoy unanimous support.  The movement highlighted the rift between Gandhiji and Periyar, who had differing perspectives on the movement's goals and outcomes. The statement ignores the complexities and divisions within Travancore society during this period.


**8. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) planned and executed the Kakori Train Action primarily to assassinate key British officials.
2.  The funds acquired from the Kakori Train Action were exclusively used to finance the purchase of weapons and ammunition for future revolutionary activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The primary objective of the Kakori Train Action was to rob the train carrying the British Indian Government treasury to fund revolutionary activities, not to assassinate British officials. While the action was revolutionary, assassination wasn't its central aim.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While a significant portion of the funds was used for weapons and ammunition, it's unlikely that *all* the funds were used solely for this purpose.  The statement implies an overly simplistic allocation of the acquired resources.  Other revolutionary activities likely also benefited from the funds.


**9. With reference to the Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The blindfold worn by the Lady Justice statue is a modern addition, reflecting the contemporary emphasis on judicial impartiality.
2.  The scales and sword held by the Lady Justice statue symbolize justice and the power of the law, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The blindfold on the Lady Justice statue is not a modern addition; it dates back to the Renaissance period, initially used as a satire on corrupt legal systems.  Its interpretation evolved during the Enlightenment period to represent impartiality. The statement incorrectly places the blindfold's origin in the modern era.

Statement 2 is correct. The scales symbolize the weighing of evidence and impartial judgment, while the sword represents the power of the law to enforce decisions and maintain order.  The statement accurately reflects the symbolism associated with the attributes of Lady Justice.


**10. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Padma Awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional circumstances, with a high bar set for such consideration.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is the highest civilian honor in India, ranking above the Bharat Ratna in terms of prestige and significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Padma Awards are normally not conferred posthumously, the government might consider it in highly deserving cases.  The statement accurately captures the general rule and the possibility of exceptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award in India; the Padma Vibhushan is a prestigious award but ranks below the Bharat Ratna. The statement incorrectly ranks the two awards.


**11. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair as Sri Vijaya Puram, consider the following statements:**

1. The renaming is intended to erase the colonial legacy associated with the name Port Blair, symbolizing a complete break from the past.
2.  The new name, Sri Vijaya Puram, directly references the historical significance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a key trading hub during the Mauryan Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The renaming aims to move away from the colonial association with the name Port Blair and to highlight the contemporary strategic importance and the role of the islands in the Indian freedom struggle.  The statement accurately reflects the intent behind the name change.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Sri Vijaya Puram's naming references the victory of the Indian freedom movement and the islands' historical significance, primarily connected to the Chola Empire (and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's visit), not the Mauryan Empire. The statement incorrectly links the name to the Mauryan period.


**12. With reference to the T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in London, organizes the T20 World Cup.
2.  The T20 World Cup format involves a maximum of 20 overs per team, aiming to provide a fast-paced and engaging viewing experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICC's headquarters are in Dubai, UAE, not London. The statement incorrectly identifies the location of the ICC headquarters.

Statement 2 is correct.  The T20 format is designed to be a shorter, faster version of cricket, making it more appealing to a wider audience. The statement accurately describes the T20 format.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi Initiative explicitly aims to improve tourist experiences through training local individuals, with a special emphasis on women and youth, to develop tourism-related products and services, fostering a more immersive and authentic experience.  The program's vision emphasizes showcasing "Incredible India through Incredible Indians," highlighting the human element of tourism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initiative spans 50 tourist destinations, it does not focus solely on large-scale infrastructure projects. Its core objective is people-centric, emphasizing the training and empowerment of local communities to enhance the tourist experience through personalized services and unique offerings like food and craft tours.  The focus is on human capital development rather than solely infrastructural development.  The scale of the program is national, aiming for a distributed, bottom-up approach to responsible tourism.


**2. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative utilizes blockchain technology to ensure 100% traceability and certification of Kasturi cotton, guaranteeing its premium quality and enhancing global competitiveness.
2. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is responsible for the production and marketing of Kasturi cotton, directly managing all aspects of the supply chain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat leverages blockchain technology for complete traceability and certification. This transparency is a key element in establishing the premium quality of the cotton and building trust with international buyers, thereby boosting its global competitiveness. The technology ensures that the entire supply chain, from the farm to the final product, is documented and verifiable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL is the implementing agency for Kasturi Cotton Bharat, it does not directly handle all aspects of the supply chain, including production. The initiative empowers ginners across India to produce the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand, indicating a decentralized production model. TEXPROCIL's role is primarily focused on implementing the branding, traceability, and certification aspects of the initiative to foster a sustainable ecosystem, not direct production and marketing.


**3. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a collaborative effort between Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, promoting the democratization of art through public installations.
2. Project PARI's initial phase exclusively focuses on commissioning contemporary digital art installations in major metropolitan areas across India, aiming to modernize urban aesthetics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project PARI is indeed a joint initiative of Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Its core objective is to democratize art by bringing it into public spaces, transforming urban landscapes into accessible galleries. The project aims to make art more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Project PARI does involve public installations in urban landscapes, it is not exclusively focused on contemporary digital art or major metropolitan areas. The project encompasses a diverse range of art forms, including traditional Indian art styles such as Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, Bani Thani Painting, and Alpana art, demonstrating a commitment to both contemporary and traditional artistic expressions across varied geographical locations, starting initially in Delhi.


**4. With reference to Geographical Indications (GI) Tags in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai is the sole authority responsible for granting GI tags to all products across India, ensuring uniform standards and procedures.
2.  A product's GI tag protects its unique characteristics linked to its geographical origin, preventing unauthorized use and safeguarding the reputation of producers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai plays a significant role, it is not the *sole* authority for granting GI tags. The process involves various stakeholders and legal frameworks at both the central and state levels, depending on the nature and origin of the product. There is a system in place for handling applications and appeals.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary purpose of a GI tag is to protect the unique qualities of a product intrinsically linked to its specific geographical origin. This protection prevents others from misrepresenting their products as originating from that particular region, safeguarding the reputation and market value of authentic products.  This protection extends to both domestic and international markets.


**5. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola rulers Rajaraja I and Rajendra I significantly expanded the empire's naval reach, leading to the conquest of regions in Southeast Asia and the establishment of a dominant presence in the Bay of Bengal.
2. Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating extensive maritime trade primarily with European powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I were instrumental in establishing the Chola Empire's naval dominance. Their aggressive military policies and successful naval expeditions led to the conquest of Sri Lanka, parts of Southeast Asia (including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra), and the control of the Bay of Bengal, transforming it into what was effectively a Chola lake. This naval power facilitated their significant maritime trade.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. Nagapattinam was indeed a vital trading center for the Cholas, but their maritime trade wasn't primarily with European powers.  At that time, European influence in the region was minimal.  The Chola trade network extended to Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia, with Nagapattinam serving as a crucial hub for this extensive network.  The emphasis on European powers is a significant distractor.


**6. With reference to the  Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement, signed in 2019, facilitated visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan on a daily basis.
2. The agreement ensures reciprocal access, allowing Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India without visa requirements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2019 agreement did establish visa-free access for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan daily. This facilitated easier pilgrimage for Indian Sikhs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The agreement was not reciprocal. While Indian Sikhs could visit Kartarpur without a visa, Pakistani Sikhs still required an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India. This lack of reciprocity is a key aspect of the agreement's limitations.  The question plays on the assumption that the agreement was fully reciprocal.


**7. With reference to the  Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right to enter temples for lower-caste individuals, leading to significant legal reforms in Travancore.
2.  The Vaikom Satyagraha resulted in a complete and immediate end to caste-based discrimination across all aspects of Travancore society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was a pivotal movement centered on securing access to public roads leading to temples for lower-caste individuals in Travancore.  While it didn't immediately achieve complete access to all temples, it did lead to significant legal reforms, including the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, marking a crucial step towards dismantling caste-based barriers to temple entry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha, while influential, did not bring about an immediate and complete end to caste-based discrimination in Travancore. While it achieved some legal victories, the fight against caste discrimination continued long after the Satyagraha concluded.  The statement overstates the immediate and complete impact of the movement.


**8. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, executed in 1925, aimed to rob a British treasury train to fund revolutionary activities, marking a significant event in the Indian independence movement.
2. The Kakori Train Action was solely planned and executed by the members of the Hindustan Republican Association, without any external support or involvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train Action, a daring robbery of a British treasury train near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, in 1925, was a pivotal event in the early stages of the Indian independence movement.  It aimed to secure funds for revolutionary activities and demonstrated the growing defiance against British rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the HRA played a central role in planning and executing the Kakori Train Action, it's an oversimplification to suggest they acted entirely independently.  The complexities of the historical event included various levels of support and potential involvement from other individuals and groups, which is often debated by historians.  The statement presents a simplified and potentially inaccurate account of the event's organization.


**9. With reference to the  Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" to categorize monuments that have been lost or destroyed.
2. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance, allowing for their removal from protection under the ASI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not an official categorization within the AMASR Act, 1958.  Its use originated in a CAG audit report, highlighting the challenges in tracing certain protected monuments.  The act itself doesn't formally define such a category.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed grants the Central Government the authority to delist monuments that are assessed as no longer being of national importance.  This provision reflects the evolving understanding of historical significance and allows for adjustments to the list of protected monuments under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).  The delisting process allows for the possibility of construction and development on the site, provided it adheres to other regulations.


**10. With reference to the  Pilgrim Corridor Projects in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pilgrim Corridor Projects primarily focus on the construction of new temples and religious structures to cater to the growing number of pilgrims.
2. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project in Varanasi serves as a model for other Pilgrim Corridor Projects, emphasizing preservation, restoration, and enhanced visitor experiences.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Pilgrim Corridor Projects aim to enhance pilgrimage experiences, their focus isn't solely on constructing new temples.  They encompass a broader range of initiatives, including preservation, restoration of existing structures, improved infrastructure, and the creation of more accessible pathways and visitor facilities.  The statement oversimplifies the scope of the projects.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project in Varanasi has become a benchmark for subsequent Pilgrim Corridor Projects.  It demonstrates a comprehensive approach encompassing preservation and restoration of existing temples, development of infrastructure, integration of heritage elements, and enhancement of the overall visitor experience, serving as a template for similar projects at other sites.


**1. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton from India with 100% traceability and certification, utilizing blockchain technology for traceability.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency.
2.  The initiative aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by promoting self-regulation in branding, traceability, and certification, creating a sustainable ecosystem.  It is a joint initiative involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect details about Kasturi Cotton Bharat. Statement 1 correctly identifies Kasturi Cotton's premium quality, its use of blockchain technology for traceability, and TEXPROCIL's role as the implementing agency.  Statement 2 correctly describes the initiative's aim to enhance global competitiveness through self-regulation and the collaborative nature of the project involving various stakeholders. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in either statement.


**2. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a Ministry of Culture initiative executed by the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Lalit Kala Akademi, aiming to transform urban landscapes into accessible art galleries through public art installations.  The first intervention is in Prayagraj.
2.  The project involves over 150 visual artists creating various artworks, including Thangka paintings, Cheriyal paintings, Bani Thani paintings, and Alpana art, demonstrating the diversity of Indian art forms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is entirely accurate, detailing the scope and artistic diversity of Project PARI.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the executing agencies and the aim are correctly stated, the location of the first intervention is wrongly mentioned as Prayagraj; it is actually Delhi.  This inaccuracy makes statement 1 incorrect, even though parts of it are factually true.


**3. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is delisting 18 centrally protected monuments deemed "untraceable" and lacking national importance, based on a report by the Ministry of Culture.  This process is governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.
2.  Among the monuments facing delisting are the Kos Minar No. 13 (Haryana), Gunner Burkill's tomb (Jhansi), and Telia Nala ruins (Varanasi).  The term "Missing Monuments" is explicitly defined within the AMASR Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  It accurately reflects the ASI's action, the rationale behind it, the legal basis (Section 35 of the AMASR Act), and the involvement of the Ministry of Culture. Statement 2, however, contains an error. While the listed monuments are indeed among those facing delisting, the claim that "Missing Monuments" is a term explicitly defined in the AMASR Act is incorrect. The text explicitly states that this term originated from a CAG Audit report, not the act itself.  This makes statement 2 false.


**4. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Instituted in 1954, the Padma Awards are among India's highest civilian honors, announced annually on Republic Day, and conferred in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.  They are always conferred posthumously.
2. The Padma Awards are given across various disciplines, including art, medicine, literature, education, and sports.  The awards constitute a title that can be used as a suffix or prefix to the recipient's name.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 incorrectly states that Padma Awards are *always* conferred posthumously.  The text clearly mentions that while normally not conferred posthumously, exceptions are made in highly deserving cases. Statement 2 is incorrect in claiming that the awards constitute a title usable as a suffix or prefix; the text explicitly states the opposite.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare based on Anubhav write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees and pensioners on the Anubhav Portal.  The awards aim to promote administrative reforms by incorporating the experiences of retiring employees.
2. The 7th Anubhav Awards Ceremony was held in Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi.  The awards are primarily focused on recognizing exceptional contributions in the field of science and technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Anubhav Awards, their basis, the awarding body, and their aim to foster good governance. Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts. First, the venue mentioned is incorrect; it was Vigyan Bhawan, not Rashtrapati Bhavan. Second, the claim that the awards focus on science and technology is false; the text indicates that they are based on the experiences shared by retiring government employees across various fields, not limited to science and technology.


**6. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The President approves Gallantry Awards for Armed Forces and Central Armed Police Forces personnel, announced twice a year—on Republic Day and Independence Day.  The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950.
2. The order of precedence for Gallantry Awards is: Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. Peacetime Gallantry Awards were instituted in 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Ashoka Chakra was not instituted in 1950; the text states that wartime Gallantry Awards (including Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950, while the Ashoka Chakra (initially in three classes) was instituted in 1952. Statement 2 correctly identifies the order of precedence and clarifies that peacetime Gallantry Awards were instituted later, although not specifically in 1967 (the text mentions renaming in 1967).


**7. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Established in 1954, initially called "State Awards," the National Film Awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973.
2.  The awards include President's Gold Medals, certificates of merit, silver medals for regional films, and the "Most Film-Friendly State" award. Satyajit Ray won a National Film Award in 2018.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the National Film Awards, their establishment, initial name, categories, and administrative body.  Statement 2, however, contains an error. While the awards do include the elements mentioned, the claim that Satyajit Ray won an award in 2018 is incorrect; the text lists him as a winner in 1985.  This makes statement 2 false.


**8. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ‘Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum’ was shortlisted for the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, an annual award given since 2015 recognizing contemporary architectural achievements worldwide.  The award has categories for various building types, including airports, campuses, and museums.
2.  The Prix Versailles Award criteria include innovation, creativity, reflection of local heritage, ecological efficiency, and promotion of social interaction. Projects must align with principles of intelligent sustainability, considering their ecological, social, and cultural impacts. The award is primarily focused on showcasing sustainable architecture in developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the Prix Versailles Award, its purpose, the year of its inception, and the categories it encompasses, and accurately mentions the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum's shortlisting. Statement 2 is largely accurate in describing the award criteria, but its final clause is misleading. While the award considers ecological, social, and cultural impacts, it is not *primarily* focused on developing countries; it has a global scope.  This inaccuracy makes statement 2 incorrect.


**9. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is located near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Rajgir (Bihar) and is designed as a 'Net Zero Green Campus'.  It was established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010, based on a decision at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.
2. The ancient Nalanda University, founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, was a monastic university (Mahavihara) that offered a wide range of disciplines, including Vedas, Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy.  Admissions were based on a lottery system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the new Nalanda University campus, its location, design, establishment, and the decision that led to its creation. Statement 2 is mostly correct in its description of the ancient Nalanda University, except for the last part.  The text states that admissions were strictly by merit, not a lottery system.  This inaccuracy makes statement 2 incorrect.


**10. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act empowers the Central Government to declare monuments of national importance and regulates archaeological excavations, protecting sculptures and carvings.  It also defines the term "Missing Monuments."
2.  Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and places of national importance. The National Monuments Authority (NMA), under the Ministry of Culture, was established by the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, to manage prohibited and regulated areas near centrally protected monuments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the Act does empower the Central Government to declare monuments of national importance and regulates archaeological excavations, it does *not* define the term "Missing Monuments."  Statement 2 is entirely accurate, correctly linking Article 49 of the Constitution with the protection of monuments and accurately describing the NMA's establishment and functions.


**11. With reference to the  Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  Launched in 1992, the MoW Programme aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage, enable universal access to it, and enhance public awareness.  It maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. The International Register includes entries like the Rig Veda.
2.  The MoW Programme's literary works include the Ramcharitmanas (a poetic retelling of the Ramayana written in Awadhi), the Panchatantra (an ancient collection of Indian fables), and the Sahṛdayāloka-Locana (a text on Indian poetics by Acharya Anandvardhan, with a commentary by Abinava Gupta).  The programme is primarily concerned with preserving oral traditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the MoW Programme, its aims, the registers it maintains, and provides a correct example from the International Register. Statement 2 correctly lists some literary works associated with the program's scope, but the final clause is inaccurate.  While the programme deals with written documents, it is not *primarily* concerned with oral traditions; its focus is broader than that.


**12. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Sahitya Akademi on a writer, reserved for those considered "immortals of literature."  Ruskin Bond was awarded this fellowship.
2.  The fellowship is awarded annually on Independence Day.  The selection criteria primarily consider the writer's contribution to regional literature and their social activism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship and accurately mentions Ruskin Bond as a recipient. Statement 2 is incorrect in specifying the award date and selection criteria. The text does not provide information on the exact date of the award, nor does it specify that social activism is a primary selection criterion.  The focus is more on overall literary contribution.


**13. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observes IAD to commemorate the day Lord Buddha descended from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh.  The event is marked by the Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya.
2.  The IAD celebrations also commemorate the recent declaration of Pali as a classical language by the Cabinet.  The celebrations primarily focus on promoting Buddhist philosophy in modern India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the IAD. Statement 1 correctly describes the event's commemoration and its connection to Lord Buddha's descent and the Asokan Elephant Pillar. Statement 2 correctly mentions the concurrent celebration of Pali's declaration as a classical language.  While the celebrations likely involve promoting Buddhist philosophy, it's not exclusively the primary focus; the broader context of Buddhist culture and history is also part of the commemoration.


**14. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda preached Vedanta philosophy (Uttara Mimāṁsā), incorporating Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita, and Dvaita systems.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 to promote social service and education.
2.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 was widely acclaimed.  He also inspired Jamsetji Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Mumbai in 1909.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes Swami Vivekananda's contribution to Vedanta philosophy and his establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while his Chicago address was indeed acclaimed, and he did inspire Jamsetji Tata, the IISC was established in Bangalore, not Mumbai.  This makes statement 2 incorrect.


**15.  With reference to Ratan Naval Tata's accomplishments, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Naval Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue surged from $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of India's largest employers.  He launched the Tata Nano and received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.
2. Tata Motors received the PETA India Cow-Friendly Future Award for using vegan interiors in its AVINYA Concept car. Ratan Tata also received the Bharat Ratna award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects Ratan Tata's achievements, including the revenue growth of the Tata Group, the launch of the Tata Nano, and the Padma Vibhushan award. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Tata Motors did receive the PETA award, the claim that Ratan Tata received the Bharat Ratna is false; the text does not mention him receiving this award.


**16. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, granted by the President for outstanding service in any field.  Recommendations for the award are made formally by a dedicated committee appointed by the President.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President along with a medallion. The award includes a significant monetary grant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because recommendations are made by the Prime Minister, not through a formally appointed committee. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while recipients do receive a Sanad and medallion, the text explicitly states that the award does *not* come with any monetary grant.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**17. With reference to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Budget 2024-25 announced the construction of corridor projects for the Vishnupad Temple at Gaya and the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, inspired by the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor in Varanasi.  The Vishnupad and Mahabodhi Temples are located approximately 5 km apart.
2. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project, also known as Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham, aims to create an easily accessible pathway connecting the temple to the banks of the river Ganga. The foundation stone for this corridor was laid down in 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the budget announcement and inspiration from the Varanasi project are accurate, the distance between the Vishnupad and Mahabodhi Temples is incorrectly stated as 5km; it is actually around 10km. Statement 2 accurately describes the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project and its aims and the date of foundation stone laying.  The inaccuracy in statement 1 makes it incorrect.


**18. With reference to the fight against illicit trafficking of antiquities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Culture Pathway, an outcome document of the G20 Culture Working Group, endorsed a global coalition to combat illicit trafficking.  At the national level, Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, prevents the export of antiquities outside India.
2. If an antiquity is traced, the National Monuments Authority (NMA) is responsible for coordinating and recovering the antiquities.  The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award is specifically designed to promote the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the global and national efforts to combat illicit trafficking, mentioning the G20 initiative and Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), not the NMA, is responsible for coordinating and recovering traced antiquities.  Furthermore, the claim that the Prix Versailles Award is specifically designed to combat illicit trafficking is inaccurate; its focus is on architectural achievements.


**19. With reference to International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21 (Summer Solstice) as IYD in 2014 to raise awareness worldwide about yoga's benefits.  India proposed the draft resolution, which was endorsed by 175 member states.
2. Yoga, derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj" meaning "to join," symbolizes the unity of mind and body.  It is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, originating from the Indus Valley Civilization around 2700 BC, as evidenced by seals and fossil remains.  Patanjali's Yogasutra is the earliest systematic reference to Yoga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the proclamation of IYD, the date, the year, the proposer of the resolution, and the number of endorsing states. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while the etymology of "Yoga" and its symbolism are correctly explained, and it is correctly identified as one of six schools of Indian philosophy, the claim of its origin from Indus Valley Civilization based on seals and fossil remains is an overstatement; the text mentions evidence suggesting its prevalence, but not definitive origin.  The statement about Patanjali's Yogasutra is correct.  The inaccuracies in statement 2 make it incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right of entry for all castes into the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, and its success led to the immediate implementation of the Temple Entry Proclamation.
2.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was a key figure, actively mobilizing volunteers and garnering public support, but his dissatisfaction with the partial success of the movement led to his eventual departure from the Congress.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vaikom Satyagraha did indeed center on securing temple entry for lower-caste Hindus, its success was not immediate.  The Temple Entry Proclamation, granting access to lower-caste individuals into temples, was a landmark legal victory, but it came years later, in 1936. The Satyagraha itself achieved partial success, opening only three of the four roads leading to the temple.  This partial victory, falling short of complete access, highlights the complexities of social reform movements and their incremental progress.

Statement 2 is correct. E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a crucial role in the Vaikom Satyagraha, significantly contributing to its mobilization and public support. His imprisonment during the movement underscores his commitment. However, his dissatisfaction with the incomplete victory, reflecting a broader critique of the movement's limitations in addressing caste-based discrimination, ultimately led to his departure from the Indian National Congress.  This highlights the diverse perspectives and strategies within the broader anti-caste movement.


**2. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, executed in 1925, was primarily aimed at securing funds for the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) through the looting of a British treasury train near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh. The key figures involved were primarily from the upper caste.
2.  The action, though ultimately unsuccessful in achieving its long-term political goals, significantly impacted the revolutionary movement by inspiring subsequent actions and contributing to the growth of nationalist sentiment.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train Action of 1925 was indeed a daring attempt by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) to rob a British treasury train to finance their revolutionary activities.  The action's primary objective was to acquire funds for the HRA’s operations. While the participation of individuals from various social backgrounds within the HRA is documented, the statement's assertion about the upper-caste dominance requires further nuanced examination of the historical records.

Statement 2 is also correct. While the Kakori Train Action didn't immediately lead to the overthrow of British rule, it served as a significant symbolic act of defiance and inspired subsequent revolutionary activities. The action contributed to the growing nationalist sentiment and played a role in shaping the future trajectory of the Indian independence movement. Its impact lies not only in its immediate consequences but also its long-term influence on the revolutionary narrative.


**3. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist monuments solely on their physical untraceability, as defined by the AMASR Act, 1958.
2. The delisting process involves a thorough assessment of a monument's national importance, considering factors such as historical significance, architectural merit, and potential for conservation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the "untraceability" of some monuments was a factor leading to the proposal for delisting, the ASI's decision is not based solely on this criterion. The AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework but doesn't exclusively define delisting based on untraceability.  The assessment involves a broader evaluation of the monument's significance. The term "missing monuments," used in some reports, is not a formal term within the Act, adding to the complexity of the issue.

Statement 2 is correct. The delisting of centrally protected monuments involves a multi-faceted assessment of their national importance.  This assessment goes beyond mere physical location and considers the historical context, architectural value, and the feasibility of conservation efforts.  This process requires careful evaluation and involves multiple stakeholders, ensuring a comprehensive review before any monument is delisted.


**4. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While improving the quality of cotton fiber is a component of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, its scope is broader than just agricultural techniques. The initiative aims to create a sustainable ecosystem encompassing branding, traceability, and certification,  enhancing the overall value and competitiveness of Indian cotton in the global market. This holistic approach addresses multiple aspects of the cotton industry, not just the agricultural production.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is the use of blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification. This technology allows for transparent tracking of the cotton from its origin to the final product, enhancing accountability and building consumer trust. This strengthens the brand's reputation and provides a competitive edge in the global marketplace.

(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

It does not primarily involve private art galleries. The project's focus is on promoting Indian art in public spaces, not solely contemporary forms. The inclusion of traditional art forms alongside contemporary works is a significant aspect of the initiative’s diverse approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of Project PARI is to democratize art, making it more accessible to the public. This is achieved by transforming urban spaces into open-air art galleries through the installation of diverse artworks, including paintings, murals, and sculptures.  The project aims to integrate art into daily life, enriching the urban environment and fostering broader appreciation for art.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India indeed features open eyes, symbolizing a departure from the traditional blindfold. This change is meant to convey that the law is not blind but actively engages with the complexities of society, recognizing its diverse perspectives and nuances. The retention of the scales of justice signifies the continued commitment to impartiality in weighing evidence.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The statue’s attire has been changed to a saree, reflecting a deliberate effort towards decolonization and a reconnection with Indian traditions. The replacement of the sword with the Indian Constitution underscores the supremacy of the Constitution and its central role in Indian jurisprudence, emphasizing justice rooted in constitutional values rather than solely punitive measures.


**7.  With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion, which took place in the mid-19th century, was primarily led by a group of Santhal women, Phulo and Jhano, along with their brothers.
2. Karl Marx, in his writings, recognized the Santhal Rebellion as one of the earliest organized mass revolts in India, highlighting its significance in the context of colonial resistance.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Phulo and Jhano were important figures in the Santhal Rebellion, it was not solely led by women.  The rebellion was led by a group of Santhal brothers—Sidho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav—alongside the sisters, Phulo and Jhano.  The leadership was shared, and their collective efforts played a vital role in mobilizing the Santhal community.


Statement 2 is correct. Karl Marx did indeed acknowledge the Santhal Rebellion in his writings as a significant event in India's history. His recognition of the rebellion as an early example of organized mass revolt highlights its importance in the context of colonial resistance.  Marx's commentary provides an external perspective on the rebellion's significance in the broader historical narrative.


**8. With reference to the Justice Party Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Justice Party, primarily active in the early 20th century, was a political organization that advocated for the interests of non-Brahmin communities in South India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Justice Party was a significant political movement in South India, primarily representing the interests of non-Brahmin communities.  It arose from a desire to counter the perceived dominance of the Brahmin community in government, education, and other spheres of life.  The party played a crucial role in advocating for greater social and political representation for non-Brahmin groups.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Justice Party’s aims were directly opposed to securing greater representation for the Brahmin community.  It actively worked against what it perceived as Brahminical dominance in various aspects of society.  The party's influence on British Raj policies was indirect and complex, reflecting the broader political dynamics of the time.  The party's impact was more on the social and political landscape of South India than on the overall policies of the British Raj.


**9. With reference to the Self-Respect Movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Self-Respect Movement, led by E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar), was primarily a Hindu reformist movement focused on promoting traditional Hindu values.
2. The movement advocated for social justice, gender equality, and the eradication of caste-based discrimination, challenging the traditional social hierarchy in South India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Self-Respect Movement did engage with certain aspects of Hindu tradition, it was not primarily a Hindu reformist movement in the traditional sense.  Periyar's critique of Brahmanical Hinduism and his focus on social justice transcended the boundaries of traditional Hindu reform, often challenging core tenets of the religion.  The movement's focus was on social change, not merely religious reform.

Statement 2 is correct. The Self-Respect Movement, under Periyar's leadership, was a powerful force for social justice, advocating for the eradication of caste-based discrimination and promoting gender equality. It challenged the traditional social hierarchy prevalent in South India, questioning the very foundations of the caste system and advocating for a more egalitarian society.  The movement's impact extended far beyond religious reform, addressing broader social and political issues.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gandhi employed non-violent resistance, his primary focus in South Africa was not on achieving political independence from British rule. His efforts were primarily directed against the racial discrimination faced by Indian communities within the South African context.  His strategies focused on securing equal rights and fighting against discriminatory laws.  While his methods later influenced other anti-colonial movements, his immediate context in South Africa was different.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gandhi played a pivotal role in establishing organizations like the Natal Indian Congress and the publication of Indian Opinion. These initiatives were crucial in mobilizing Indian communities in South Africa to resist racial discrimination and advocate for their rights.  His leadership in these organizations laid the groundwork for a more organized and effective resistance movement.  These contributions were fundamental to the development of his philosophy of Satyagraha and its application against racial injustice.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Padma Awards, among India's highest civilian honors, were established in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day.  This is a well-established fact widely known and easily verifiable.

Statement 2 is also correct. While Padma Awards are typically not conferred posthumously, the government does make exceptions in highly deserving cases. The three categories—Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri—represent different levels of distinguished service, accurately reflecting the award structure.  The statement correctly captures this nuance.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, not a peacetime award. The Ashoka Chakra, while also a gallantry award, is presented for bravery in the face of enemy action, typically during wartime.  The statement incorrectly reverses the contexts of these two awards.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Gallantry awards are announced twice a year – once on Republic Day and again on Independence Day. This is a key aspect of the award system's operational procedures.  Both statements contain factual inaccuracies, making (d) the only correct option.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based on a report from the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Tourism.  The ministry responsible for cultural heritage is the relevant authority for such decisions.

(a) 1 only

This constitutional provision underscores the legal basis for the AMASR Act.  Only statement 2 is accurate.

Ramaswamy Naicker, for example, had a different interpretation of the movement's significance.  Both statements contain factual errors.

These entities collaborate in the branding, traceability, and certification processes, making TEXPROCIL's role part of a larger collaborative effort rather than a solely independent undertaking.  The collaborative nature ensures broader participation and better representation of the interests of all stakeholders.


**2. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a Ministry of Culture initiative executed solely by the Lalit Kala Akademi, aiming to create public art installations across India's major cities.
2. The project utilizes traditional Indian art forms, such as Thangka painting and Cheriyal painting, to promote cultural diversity and accessibility in public spaces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

The National Gallery of Modern Art is also involved in its implementation. The project's scope is not limited to major cities, with its initial intervention taking place in Delhi, but expansion to other areas is implied.  The collaborative nature of execution ensures a broader range of expertise and perspectives are brought to bear on the project.

Statement 2 is correct. Project PARI indeed aims to showcase the diversity of Indian art by incorporating traditional forms like Thangka painting (Sikkim/Ladakh), Cheriyal painting (Telangana), Bani Thani Painting (Rajasthan), and Alpana art (Tripura) into public art installations. This strategic inclusion enhances the project's cultural significance and strengthens its connection to the nation's artistic heritage, making it more accessible and engaging for the public.


**3. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative focuses exclusively on training women in tourism-related services to promote gender equality and empower women economically.
2. The Ministry of Tourism's vision is to enhance the tourist experience by creating a network of local ambassadors who provide information and personalized experiences across 50 tourist destinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative does place special emphasis on training women and youth, it's not exclusively focused on women.  The initiative aims to provide tourism-related training and awareness to a broader range of people to enhance the overall tourist experience.  The inclusion of youth alongside women reflects a commitment to engaging a wider demographic in the tourism sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The core vision of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is to elevate the tourist experience by training local individuals to act as friendly ambassadors and storytellers for their respective destinations.  This strategy aims to provide tourists with more personalized and authentic interactions, enriching their overall travel experience. The focus on 50 tourist destinations suggests a nationwide effort to improve tourism infrastructure and engagement.


**4. With reference to the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The new statue depicts Lady Justice in traditional Indian attire (saree), with open eyes, holding the Indian Constitution instead of a sword, and retaining the scales of justice.
2. The decision to replace the traditional blindfold with open eyes symbolizes the law's blindness to societal differences and its impartial nature, irrespective of class or background.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court indeed showcases Lady Justice in a saree, symbolizing a shift towards Indian tradition.  The open eyes represent a departure from the traditional depiction of blind justice, signifying awareness and understanding of societal complexities.  The replacement of the sword with the Indian Constitution emphasizes the rule of law and constitutional values. The retention of the scales ensures the continued emphasis on impartial weighing of evidence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The open eyes on the new statue are meant to represent the law's awareness of the complexities and differentiations within society, not its blindness to them. The traditional blindfold symbolized impartiality, but the open eyes in this context emphasize an informed and engaged justice system that acknowledges societal nuances while maintaining impartiality in its judgments.  The open eyes signify a conscious and knowledgeable approach to justice, not a lack of awareness.


**5. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) delists monuments based solely on their lack of physical traceability, irrespective of their historical or cultural significance.
2. The AMASR Act, 1958, empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed to have ceased to be of national importance, allowing for regular construction and urbanization activities in those areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the "untraceability" of some monuments was a factor in the ASI's decision to delist, it's not the sole criterion. The assessment also considered the lack of national importance.  The delisting process involves a thorough evaluation of the monument's historical and cultural significance, not just its physical location.  The decision-making process considers multiple factors to ensure a balanced approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, does indeed empower the Central Government to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance.  This provision allows for the potential resumption of construction and urbanization activities in these areas, reflecting a pragmatic approach to balancing preservation with development needs.  The act provides a legal framework for managing such situations.


**6. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Nalanda University campus is a net-zero green campus built near the ruins of the ancient Nalanda University, established under the Nalanda University Act of 2010.
2. The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, was a monastic university known for its extensive library, "Dharma Gunj," and its diverse curriculum including Vedas, Buddhism, and fine arts, with admissions strictly based on merit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The newly inaugurated Nalanda University campus is indeed designed as a net-zero green campus, reflecting a commitment to sustainability.  Its location near the ancient Nalanda ruins underscores its historical connection. The university's establishment is directly linked to the Nalanda University Act, 2010, providing a legal basis for its operation and development.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The ancient Nalanda University was a renowned monastic institution founded in the 5th century CE.  Its vast library, "Dharma Gunj," housed a massive collection of books. The curriculum covered a wide range of subjects, including Vedic studies, various Buddhist schools of thought, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and even military strategy.  The rigorous admission process ensured that only the most deserving students were admitted, based on merit.


**7. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a non-violent protest lasting 604 days, was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi and focused on securing voting rights for lower-caste Hindus in the princely state of Travancore.
2.  The movement's outcome included the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting lower-caste individuals access to temples and highlighting a divergence of opinion between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker regarding the movement's nature and objectives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vaikom Satyagraha was a non-violent protest lasting 604 days and took place in the princely state of Travancore, it was not primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi.  Leaders like T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan played pivotal roles. The movement's central aim was to secure access to public roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple for lower-caste Hindus, not voting rights.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha did lead to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, a significant legal victory granting lower-caste individuals access to temples. The movement also highlighted a key difference in perspective between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker.  Gandhi viewed it as a Hindu reformist movement, while Periyar considered it a fight against caste-based atrocities.  This difference in interpretation led to Periyar's eventual departure from the Indian National Congress.


**8. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion (1855-1856), led by Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav, along with their sisters Phulo and Jhano, was primarily a response to the British government's introduction of the Permanent Settlement system in the Rajmahal Hills.
2. Karl Marx referred to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution, highlighting its significance in the context of colonial resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion was not a direct response to the Permanent Settlement system.  The rebellion's causes were multifaceted, stemming from the exploitation and oppression faced by the Santhals at the hands of British colonial authorities and moneylenders. Issues like land encroachment, debt bondage, and the imposition of unfair taxes were major contributing factors to the uprising.

Statement 2 is correct. Karl Marx did indeed refer to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution in his writings, acknowledging its significance in the broader context of anti-colonial resistance. This recognition underscores the rebellion's scale, organization, and its challenge to British authority in India.  Marx's observation highlights the rebellion's importance as a precursor to later, larger-scale movements.


**9. With reference to the Summer Solstice, consider the following statements:**

1. During the Summer Solstice (June 21), the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, resulting in the longest day and shortest night in the Southern Hemisphere.
2.  Places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for approximately six months during the Summer Solstice due to the Earth's axial tilt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. During the Summer Solstice (June 21), the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, resulting in the longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere.  The Southern Hemisphere experiences the opposite—its shortest day and longest night. The solstices mark the points in Earth's orbit where the tilt of the Earth's axis is most inclined toward or away from the sun.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Earth's axial tilt is the reason that places beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight for about six months during the summer solstice.  This phenomenon is due to the continuous illumination caused by the Earth's tilt relative to the sun during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.  The same phenomenon occurs in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer solstice.


**10. With reference to the Flag Code of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2022 amendment to the Flag Code of India allows for the display of the National Flag only during specific national holidays and events,  restricting its use by private individuals.
2. The Flag Code of India, 2002 (as amended), specifies that the National Flag must be made of hand-spun and hand-woven cotton, prohibiting the use of machine-made or synthetic materials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2022 amendment to the Flag Code of India actually broadened the permissible display of the National Flag.  It allows for its display by private individuals on all days and nights, removing previous restrictions. The amendment reflects a move towards greater public participation in patriotic displays.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The 2021 amendment to the Flag Code of India updated the permissible materials for the National Flag.  While hand-spun and hand-woven cotton remains acceptable, the amendment added machine-made materials such as polyester, wool, and silk, alongside cotton and Ichadi bunting.  This change reflects an acknowledgement of the advancements in textile manufacturing.


**11. With reference to Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai is the sole authority responsible for granting GI tags to products from all over India, ensuring uniformity and consistency in the process.
2. GI tags protect the unique identity and quality of products linked to specific geographical regions, enhancing their market value and safeguarding the interests of producers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai plays a significant role in granting GI tags, it's not the sole authority. The process involves various stakeholders and legal frameworks at both national and international levels. The system is designed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation and protection of geographical indications.

Statement 2 is correct. GI tags are indeed crucial for protecting the unique identity and quality of products associated with specific geographical regions.  These tags offer legal protection, enhancing the market value of the products and safeguarding the interests of producers who uphold the quality and reputation of those products.  The system encourages regional specialization and promotes economic growth.


**12. With reference to Nelson Mandela's life and legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Nelson Mandela, born in 1918, was a key figure in the anti-apartheid movement, serving as South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994 after spending 27 years in prison.  He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and the Bharat Ratna by India.
2.  The United Nations declared apartheid a crime against humanity in 1971, leading to the establishment of international bodies like the Special Committee against Apartheid and the Centre against Apartheid to combat this practice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nelson Mandela's life and legacy are inextricably linked to the anti-apartheid struggle. He was instrumental in leading the movement, serving as the first democratically elected president of South Africa in 1994, after his release from 27 years of imprisonment. He received numerous accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and the Bharat Ratna from India, recognizing his immense contribution to peace and human rights.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The United Nations officially declared apartheid a crime against humanity in 1971, a crucial step in the international fight against this system of racial segregation and discrimination.  This declaration led to the establishment of various UN bodies like the Special Committee against Apartheid and the Centre against Apartheid to coordinate international efforts aimed at ending apartheid.  These efforts played a significant role in the eventual dismantling of apartheid in South Africa.


**13. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, a symbolic gesture of fearlessness, is associated with the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, and is often depicted in Buddhist art and iconography.
2.  The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra, representing the preaching of the Dhamma, is typically displayed with the palms facing upwards, signifying openness and acceptance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Abhaya Mudra is indeed a symbolic gesture of fearlessness, protection, and reassurance.  It's prominently associated with the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, and is frequently depicted in Buddhist art and iconography. The mudra's meaning conveys a sense of security and spiritual guidance.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra, signifying the turning of the wheel of Dharma (cosmic law), is depicted with the right hand placed palm down on the lap, and the left hand resting on the lap palm upwards.  The gesture symbolizes the Buddha's teachings and the dissemination of his wisdom. While the description in statement 2 about the palms facing upwards isn't entirely accurate for all depictions, the core meaning of spreading the Dharma is correct, making this statement largely true.  The slight inaccuracy about the palm positions is not enough to render the statement false.


**14. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-US Cultural Property Agreement aims to facilitate the return of Indian antiquities illicitly trafficked to the United States, strengthening efforts to prevent the illegal trade of cultural artifacts.
2.  The agreement primarily relies on the provisions of Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The India-US Cultural Property Agreement is designed to prevent and curb the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA.  A key objective is to facilitate the repatriation of Indian artifacts that have been illegally exported. The agreement strengthens bilateral cooperation in protecting cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the agreement aligns with the principles of the 1970 UNESCO Convention, it's not solely reliant on Article 9.  The agreement establishes a specific bilateral framework for cooperation between India and the US, going beyond the general provisions of the UNESCO convention.  It provides a more targeted and efficient mechanism for dealing with illicit trafficking between these two specific countries.  The UNESCO convention sets broader international standards, while the bilateral agreement provides a more practical and focused approach.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred posthumously only in exceptional circumstances.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Shri recognizes exceptional and distinguished service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954 and are primarily awarded to living individuals for exceptional and distinguished service. However, the government may consider conferring the award posthumously in highly deserving cases. This makes the statement accurate in its core assertion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The hierarchy of Padma Awards is as follows: Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma Bhushan (distinguished service of a high order), and Padma Shri (distinguished service).  The statement reverses the descriptions of Padma Vibhushan and Padma Shri. This reversal is a significant factual inaccuracy.  The subtle difference in phrasing between "exceptional and distinguished service" and "distinguished service of a high order" is crucial and designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the award criteria.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Home Affairs, based on write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees.
2.  The primary aim of the Anubhav Awards is to recognize the exceptional contributions of retiring employees to administrative efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. This is a key factual detail that distinguishes between two government departments with overlapping but distinct responsibilities.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that it addresses the general goal but not specifically the aim. While recognizing contributions is a byproduct, the core aim is to foster good governance and administrative reforms by utilizing the experience shared by retiring employees.  The phrasing in statement 2 oversimplifies the award's purpose, focusing on a consequence rather than the intended impact on future administration.


**3. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashoka Chakra is awarded for the highest degree of bravery in the face of the enemy, ranking above the Param Vir Chakra.
2.  Gallantry Awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Param Vir Chakra ranks above the Ashoka Chakra in the order of precedence for Gallantry Awards.  This is a critical detail that demonstrates the candidate's understanding of the relative importance of these prestigious awards. The inversion of the ranking is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year – once on Republic Day and again on Independence Day. This is a straightforward factual error designed to test precise knowledge.


**4. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative focuses solely on training women in tourism-related skills to enhance the overall tourist experience.
2.  The initiative aims to create a network of local ambassadors who can provide authentic storytelling and insights about their destinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative places special emphasis on training women and youth, it's not limited exclusively to women. The training extends to all individuals involved in tourism to improve the overall tourist experience. The statement's restrictive nature misrepresents the program's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The core aim of the initiative is to elevate the tourist experience by connecting visitors with local people who are knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their region. This involves providing training and creating a network of ambassadors who can share authentic stories and insights, making the statement accurate.


**5. With reference to the Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry is located in Mumbai and grants GI tags to products from across India.
2.  GI tags protect the unique identity and quality of products linked to a specific geographical region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Registry is located in Chennai, not Mumbai. This is a straightforward factual error intended to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the registry's location.

Statement 2 is correct.  The purpose of GI tags is to protect the unique identity and quality of products associated with a specific geographical origin. This protection safeguards the reputation and market value of these products, making the statement accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The addition of the blindfold to the statue of Lady Justice occurred during the Renaissance, not in ancient Greece. It was initially a satire on the corrupt legal systems of the time but later came to represent impartiality.  The statement misplaces the origin of this symbolic element.

Statement 2 is correct.  The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India indeed depicts her in a saree, replacing the traditional Western attire, and holding the Indian Constitution instead of a sword. This symbolizes the integration of Indian traditions and the supremacy of the Constitution in the Indian legal system.


**7. With reference to the delisting of monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI can delist a monument if it is deemed to be of no national importance, according to Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance.  This is a direct application of the Act's provisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act, 1958.  It was used by the CAG audit team in their report, highlighting the difference between informal usage and official terminology.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the legal framework governing the protection of monuments.


**8. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded for exceptional service in any field, including sports, and can be conferred posthumously.
2.  The design of the Bharat Ratna medal features a peepal leaf with the inscription 'Bharat Ratna' in the English alphabet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharat Ratna is awarded for exceptional service/achievements in any field, including sports, and can be conferred posthumously (though initially it wasn't). This statement accurately reflects the award's broad scope and eligibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bharat Ratna medal is indeed shaped like a peepal leaf, the inscription 'Bharat Ratna' is in Devanagari script, not the English alphabet. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise factual recall in the context of Indian awards.


**9. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train Action was indeed organized by the HRA to obtain funds for their revolutionary activities.  This is a central fact about the event.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kakori Train Action took place in 1925 near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, not in 1926 near Allahabad.  This error combines a factual inaccuracy (the year) with an imprecise location, creating a strong distractor.


**11. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure heavily relied on the Amara-Nayaka system, where local rulers were granted autonomy in exchange for military service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Amara-Nayaka system was a cornerstone of the Vijayanagara Empire's political structure, granting considerable autonomy to local rulers in exchange for military support and revenue collection. This system is a key element of the empire's administrative organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Krishnadevaraya's reign was actually a period of great expansion and prosperity for the Vijayanagara Empire, not a period of decline. The statement misrepresents a crucial period in the empire's history, inverting its characterization.


**12. With reference to the Keeladi excavation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Keeladi excavation site is located on the banks of the Cauvery River in Tamil Nadu.
2.  The excavations have provided evidence of a sophisticated urban settlement with evidence of internal and external trade during the Sangam age.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Keeladi excavations have unearthed substantial evidence of a well-developed urban settlement, including indications of extensive internal and external trade networks during the Sangam age. This finding is a crucial contribution to our understanding of the Sangam period.

These conquests highlight the empire's naval capabilities and its ambition to project power beyond the Indian subcontinent.  Statement 2 is also accurate in describing Rajendra I's expansionist naval policies.  His conquest of the Sailendra Empire, a significant power across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrated the reach and strength of the Chola navy. The description of the Bay of Bengal as a "Chola lake" is a metaphorical representation of the Chola Empire's control over this vital sea route, facilitating extensive trade with Southeast Asia and contributing to the empire's economic prosperity.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially represent the historical reality, while option (d) is completely inaccurate.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, implying a regional focus, the statement is too absolute. The MOW program has a global scope, encompassing international, regional, and national registers.  The question intends to mislead by implying the register's exclusive focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Statement 2 accurately reflects the inclusion of the three Indian literary works in the register at the 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Upper Paleolithic period did see the earliest rock paintings in India, they primarily featured linear representations of animals, not naturalistic human figures engaged in hunting and community dances.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Vijayanagara Empire's zenith actually occurred under the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Saluva Dynasty.  The Saluva Dynasty represented a transitional phase after the decline of the Sangama Dynasty.  This is a deliberate attempt to mislead candidates by interchanging the dynasties. Statement 2 accurately describes the Amara-Nayaka system, a crucial element of the Vijayanagara Empire's administrative structure.  The system's features, including tax collection and the allocation of resources for personal use, temple maintenance, and irrigation works, illustrate the decentralized nature of the empire's governance.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the historical inaccuracy in statement 1.


**8. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its cultural legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, where Emperor Ashoka defeated the Kalinga Dynasty, resulted in the widespread destruction of Buddhist sites and a decline in Buddhist influence in the region.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War did lead to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, but it did not result in the widespread destruction of Buddhist sites or a decline in Buddhist influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site and two new rock art sites were discovered at Damaratogu, the description of the rock art as depicting humans engaged in warfare and hunting is not entirely accurate.  The source mentions only animal depictions at Devarlabanda Mula.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Devarlabanda Mula is specifically mentioned as having only animal depictions, not humans. The presence of Dolmenoid Cists is mentioned in the context of the region, not specifically this site.  Both statements contain inaccuracies, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's precise recall of the details of these archaeological discoveries.


**10. With reference to Kozhikode's recognition as India's first UNESCO City of Literature, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I did strengthen Chola control over the Coromandel Coast, his naval expeditions extended far beyond the Bay of Bengal.  His conquest of Sri Lanka and his attacks on the Cheras demonstrate a broader naval reach than simply coastal dominance.  The statement underestimates the scope of his maritime power projection.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire represents a high point of Chola naval power and expansion. His conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra are well-documented, showcasing the empire's considerable maritime capabilities and influence in Southeast Asia. This expansion was a significant achievement, marking a considerable expansion of the Chola empire's reach and power.  This contrasts sharply with the limited scope suggested in statement 1.  The success of this expedition highlights the advanced shipbuilding and naval tactics employed by the Cholas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance is not limited to Europe; it's a globally practiced system of seasonal livestock migration. India has a rich tradition of transhumance, particularly in the Himalayas and other regions with varying altitudes and climates. The statement wrongly restricts transhumance to a specific geographical area and ignores its global practice.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description accurately captures the essence of transhumance in the Indian context, highlighting the participation of specific nomadic tribes and their seasonal movement between high-altitude pastures and lower plains for grazing their livestock.  This demonstrates an understanding of the practice's socio-economic and environmental significance in India. The movement is driven by the availability of pastureland throughout the year, reflecting a deep adaptation to the environment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register primarily focuses on manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, it doesn't explicitly exclude manuscripts from other regions if they meet the criteria for inclusion and have relevance to the Asia-Pacific region's cultural heritage. The statement falsely presents an absolute exclusion that doesn't reflect the program's inclusivity.

Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of these three significant Indian literary works highlights their importance in the broader context of Asian and global literary traditions.  Their presence in the register underscores their enduring value and contribution to world literature.  The selection process for the register is rigorous, ensuring only works of exceptional cultural significance are included.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the Sangameshwar Temple's location is inaccurate. It's situated at the confluence of not just two but five rivers: Krishna, Bhavanasi, Veni, Tunga, and Bhadra. The statement presents an incomplete and inaccurate depiction of the temple's geographic context. This highlights the importance of precise geographical information in understanding historical and cultural sites.

Statement 2 is correct. The annual submergence of the temple accurately illustrates the vulnerability of cultural heritage sites to environmental changes and large-scale infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is not solely Dravidian. While it incorporates some aspects of Indian temple architecture, the statement inaccurately limits its stylistic influences.  It overlooks the significant contributions from other architectural traditions. The statement demonstrates a lack of nuanced understanding of architectural styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The reconstruction after the temple's destruction by Kala Pahar incorporated a blend of Upper Burmese and Pala styles.  This fusion of architectural elements reflects the cultural exchange and historical interactions in the region. The statement correctly points out the syncretic nature of the temple's architecture. The blending of styles demonstrates the dynamic nature of architectural evolution.



**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization's trade and commerce, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization primarily relied on internal trade, with minimal evidence of extensive foreign trade connections.
2. Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as Meluha, mentioning Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) as crucial intermediary trading stations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization engaged in extensive foreign trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War was a significant event, it didn't lead to the complete destruction of Kalinga's cultural heritage or the total suppression of its identity.  Kalinga's culture continued to thrive, albeit under Mauryan rule. The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of the war's impact.  The statement ignores the resilience of Kalinga's cultural identity.

Statement 2 is correct. King Kharavela's patronage of Jainism is well-documented. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves and the Hathigumpha inscription serve as important evidence of his reign and his cultural contributions.  This demonstrates the dynasty's cultural achievements beyond its political activities.  The statement correctly highlights the cultural legacy of the Kalinga dynasty.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's administration was not entirely centralized.  The Amara-Nayaka system, a decentralized form of governance, played a significant role in administering vast territories. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of the empire's administrative structure.  The statement ignores the significant role of decentralized governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amara-Nayakas were not just military commanders; they also held significant administrative power within their territories.  They collected taxes, maintained infrastructure, and managed local affairs, making them key players in the empire's governance. The statement accurately reflects the decentralized nature of the empire's administration. The Amara-Nayaka system enabled efficient governance of a large empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

The statement highlights the multifaceted nature of Kozhikode's literary heritage.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may appear similar in subject matter, but the specific factual details and distractors will differ to ensure a diverse and challenging question set.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victory at Kandalursalai decisively weakened the Pandya navy, paving the way for Chola dominance in the region.
2.  Rajendra I's conquest extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja I's significant naval victory at Kandalursalai actually targeted and destroyed the *Chera* navy, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandyas were a separate power in South India, and while the Chera defeat certainly enhanced Chola power, it didn't directly weaken the Pandyas in the same manner.  This is a crucial detail often overlooked. The question plays on the similarity of the names and the general context of Chola expansion.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's extensive naval campaigns did indeed reach the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly expanding the Chola empire's influence in Southeast Asia. This is a well-documented aspect of Chola history highlighting their maritime prowess and geopolitical reach.  The correct answer hinges on knowing the specific target of Rajaraja I's victory.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan, focuses primarily on preserving the transhumance practices of nomadic tribes in the Himalayas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative does indeed focus on preserving transhumance, its scope is broader than just the Himalayas. Although the initiative recognizes the importance of Himalayan transhumance, it also addresses this practice globally, including regions beyond the Himalayan range. The question attempts to mislead by focusing on a specific regional aspect of a broader initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Himalayan region is home to significant transhumance practices by the mentioned tribes, this traditional practice also exists in various plains regions of India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The question uses a narrowing tactic to present a partial truth as a complete one.


**3. With reference to the 2024 T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 T20 World Cup, won by India, was the first time India had won this tournament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup was their *second* win in this tournament; they previously won in 2007. This is a simple factual error designed to test precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct.  The ICC, with its headquarters in Dubai, is indeed the global governing body for cricket and organizes major international tournaments, including the T20 World Cup. This is a straightforward piece of information about the governing body of cricket.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the renaming acknowledges the historical significance of the A&N Islands, the primary reason cited for the change is to commemorate the Indian freedom movement and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's role in unfurling the Tiranga there, not specifically its naval role during the British era. The question distorts the emphasis of the renaming.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cellular Jail, a symbol of the struggle for Indian independence, is indeed located in Sri Vijaya Puram (formerly Port Blair).  This is a well-known historical fact easily verifiable.


**5. With reference to the Olympic Games and India's participation, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India's performance in Paris 2024 was strong, it was not its best-ever; it was its third-best, falling short of its performance in Tokyo 2020 and another previous Olympics.  This statement uses a superlative to create a misleading assertion.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award for lifetime achievement in *cinema*, not sports. This is a critical distinction that tests the candidate's knowledge of the award's specific field.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Conspiracy was indeed orchestrated by HRA members, who employed armed robbery as a means to fund their revolutionary activities against the British Raj.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Jatin Das did die during a hunger strike, it was not in connection with the Lahore Conspiracy Case; it was a separate event. The question plays on the general context of revolutionary actions and martyrdom.  The specific case and the individual are deliberately mismatched.


**1. With reference to the  International Solar Alliance (ISA), consider the following statements:**

2. Rajendra I's reign saw the Chola navy conquer regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola Lake," but not the complete conquest of Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects historical accounts.  Rajaraja I, a prominent Chola ruler, significantly expanded the empire's naval power.  His military campaigns included the defeat of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and the successful subjugation of northern Sri Lanka, which became a part of the Chola dominion. These actions showcase the Chola's naval prowess and their ability to project power across maritime territories.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Rajendra I did lead successful naval expeditions that resulted in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, and the control of the Bay of Bengal is often referred to as "Chola Lake",  the text states that Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the *entire* island becoming a Chola province.  This contradicts statement 2, which implies an incomplete conquest. Thus, only Statement 1 is entirely accurate based on the provided information.


**3. With reference to the  Indus Water Treaty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The treaty, signed in 1960, allocated the eastern rivers (Beas, Ravi, and Sutlej) to Pakistan and the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) to India.
2. The World Bank served as a signatory to the Indus Waters Treaty, granting India the right to generate hydroelectric power on the western rivers under specific conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, signed with the World Bank as a signatory, divided the Indus river system between India and Pakistan. India gained control of the eastern rivers (Beas, Ravi, and Sutlej), while Pakistan received the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab).  The statement reverses the allocation of rivers.

Statement 2 is correct.  The treaty did indeed involve the World Bank as a signatory.  Furthermore, it specifically granted India the right to construct hydroelectric projects on the western rivers, subject to pre-defined design and operational criteria to ensure equitable water distribution and minimize negative impacts on downstream water flow in Pakistan.  This clause reflects the treaty's attempt to balance power-generation needs with water resource management.


**4. With reference to the  Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the newly announced corridor projects for the Vishnupad Temple at Gaya and the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya are *inspired by* the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor.  The statement reverses the inspiration. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project was the inspiration, not the other way around.

Statement 2 is correct. The foundation stone for the Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor was indeed laid in 2019.  The project's scope includes not only improving accessibility to the main temple but also the restoration and preservation of smaller temples in the surrounding area, creating a more holistic and integrated religious and cultural complex. This aligns with the broader aims of such pilgrim corridor projects to enhance visitor experience while preserving historical and religious heritage.

Statement 2 is correct.  Swami Vivekananda indeed established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897. This organization has since expanded significantly and is engaged in a wide range of social service activities, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges, reflecting the practical application of his teachings.  The contrast between the nuanced nature of his philosophical engagement (statement 1) and the clear-cut historical fact of the Ramakrishna Mission's establishment (statement 2) makes the question challenging.


**5. With reference to Ratan Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. During his leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of India's largest employers.
2.  Tata Motors received the PETA India Cow-Friendly Future Award for using vegan leather in the interiors of its Avinya concept car.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the substantial growth of the Tata Group under Ratan Tata's leadership. The revenue expansion from $5 billion to over $100 billion, along with the group's status as one of India's largest employers, demonstrates his successful stewardship.  Statement 2 contains a factual inaccuracy. While Tata Motors did receive awards and is increasingly focused on sustainable practices, the specific award mentioned—PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for using vegan leather in the Avinya concept car—is not publicly verifiable information.  The use of "vegan interiors" is true, but the specific award is not reliably sourced. The contrast between the well-documented business achievements and the less verifiable award makes the question more challenging.


**6. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India based on formal recommendations submitted by a designated committee.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion, but no monetary grant is associated with the award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President of India grants the Bharat Ratna, there is no formally constituted committee that submits recommendations. The Prime Minister typically makes recommendations to the President, but this process is not formally structured.  Statement 2 is correct.  Recipients indeed receive a Sanad signed by the President and a medallion.  Crucially, the award does not include any monetary component.  The difference between the informal nature of recommendations (statement 1) and the clear-cut description of the award's components (statement 2) makes for a nuanced question.


**7. With reference to the Sangam age, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangam poets were familiar with the social classification of Varna, and notable female poets included Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar.
2.  The three Sangams were held in Madurai (TN) and Kapadapuram (TN), with the first and third Sangams at Madurai and the second at Kapadapuram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the presence of Varna system awareness in Sangam literature and correctly names prominent female poets of the Sangam age. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While it is true that the first and third Sangams are traditionally located in Madurai, and the second in Kapadapuram, the exact locations and the very existence of the Sangams are debated by scholars.  The legendary account of three Sangams, while part of Tamil literary tradition, lacks definitive historical proof.  The contrast between the verifiable information about the poets and the less certain information about the Sangams' locations makes the question more challenging.


**8. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan Civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, was primarily a Bronze Age civilization and its discovery at Harappa in modern-day Punjab, Pakistan, was made by Daya Ram Sahni in 1924.
2.  The Harappan civilization encompassed over 2,000 sites across India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Harappan Civilization was indeed a Bronze Age civilization,  the discovery at Harappa was made in 1921 by Daya Ram Sahni, not in 1924 as stated.  The announcement by John Marshall in 1924 was significant, but Sahni's discovery predates it. Statement 2 is correct. The extensive geographical reach of the Harappan civilization, spanning over 2,000 sites across India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, is well-established.  The discrepancy in the date of discovery in statement 1 makes the question more difficult.


**9. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works recently included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
2.  The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National, aiming to preserve and promote global documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate. Statement 1 correctly identifies the inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the UNESCO MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  This reflects the international recognition of these works' cultural and historical significance. Statement 2 accurately describes the MoW Programme's objectives and structure, including its three registers and its aim to preserve and promote documentary heritage worldwide.  The question tests knowledge of both specific literary works and the broader framework of a UNESCO initiative.


**10. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, and various trade bodies and industry stakeholders.
2.  The initiative aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for Indian cotton by utilizing blockchain technology to ensure traceability and certification, with TEXPROCIL as the implementing agency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative's goals and structure. Statement 1 correctly identifies the key stakeholders involved in this joint initiative, including the Ministry of Textiles and the Cotton Corporation of India, along with various trade bodies and industry participants.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the initiative's aim to enhance the sustainability and traceability of Indian cotton through the use of blockchain technology and the role of TEXPROCIL as the implementing agency.  The question tests knowledge of a specific government initiative and its key features.  The combination of stakeholders and technological aspects makes the question more challenging.


**11. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, aims to democratize art by creating public art installations in urban landscapes, transforming them into accessible galleries.
2.  The project, executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, features artwork from various Indian art forms, including Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, and Alpana art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe Project PARI. Statement 1 accurately states the project's primary goal: to democratize art by bringing it into public spaces, making it accessible to a wider audience. It transforms urban landscapes into outdoor art galleries. Statement 2 correctly identifies the executing agencies (Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art) and highlights the inclusion of diverse Indian art forms, showcasing the country's rich artistic heritage. The question tests knowledge of a cultural initiative and its objectives.  The integration of the project's goals and its artistic scope makes the question more comprehensive.


**12. With reference to the "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative is a national responsible tourism program launched by the Ministry of Tourism across 50 tourist destinations in India.
2.  The initiative aims to promote responsible tourism practices and enhance the tourist experience by training local communities to act as guides and hosts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative was indeed launched by the Ministry of Tourism as a national responsible tourism program, covering 50 destinations. Statement 2, while plausible, is an assumption. While the initiative likely aims to improve the tourist experience, the specific training of local communities as guides and hosts is not explicitly stated in the source material.  The difference between a verifiable fact (statement 1) and an inference (statement 2) makes the question more challenging.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between explicit information and implicit assumptions.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Republic Day, encompassing three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.
2.  While generally not conferred posthumously, exceptional cases may warrant posthumous awards, and recipients are permitted to use the award as a suffix or prefix to their name.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Padma Awards, instituted in 1954, are indeed India's highest civilian honors, announced annually on Republic Day. They are categorized into Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, recognizing exceptional and distinguished service across various fields.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Padma Awards are *not* typically conferred posthumously, although exceptions might be made in highly deserving cases. More importantly, the award explicitly does *not* constitute a title and cannot be used as a suffix or prefix to a recipient's name.  This is a crucial distinction often overlooked, making this a key point for UPSC aspirants.  The rules surrounding the usage of the award are strictly defined, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of such honors.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, based on write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees.
2. The primary aim of the Anubhav Awards is to encourage the documentation of administrative processes for future reference.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (which falls under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions). They are based on "Anubhav write-ups," which are experiences shared by retiring central government employees/pensioners on the Anubhav Portal.  The slight discrepancy in the ministry name doesn't significantly alter the core meaning.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the awards encourage documentation of experiences, their main aim is to foster good governance and administrative reforms in the future *based on the lessons learned and experiences shared* by retiring employees.  The focus isn't merely on documenting processes, but on using those experiences to improve future administration. This difference in emphasis is subtle yet important for a nuanced understanding of the award's purpose.


**3. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest gallantry award, followed by the Ashoka Chakra, and the award is announced only once a year on Republic Day.
2. The Vir Chakra and Shaurya Chakra were instituted in 1952, alongside the Ashoka Chakra's three classes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. While the Param Vir Chakra is indeed the highest gallantry award, followed by the Ashoka Chakra, the awards are announced *twice* a year—on Republic Day and Independence Day.  This frequency is a key detail often missed.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The wartime gallantry awards (Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950, not 1952. The Ashoka Chakra (in its three classes) was instituted in 1952.  The chronology of the establishment of these awards is a critical aspect to remember. The confusion between the years and awards is designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge.


**4. With reference to Nelson Mandela's life and legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Nelson Mandela, born in 1918, joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944 and led non-violent protests against apartheid legislation before being imprisoned for 27 years.
2.  Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, the Bharat Ratna, and the International Gandhi Peace Prize in 2001, and the UN celebrates Nelson Mandela International Day on July 18th every year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Statement 1 accurately portrays Mandela's early life, his involvement with the ANC, his leadership in non-violent protests against apartheid, and his subsequent imprisonment.  The details are presented in a manner that might lead to confusion if not carefully considered.

Statement 2 correctly lists the major awards received by Mandela – the Nobel Peace Prize (1993), the Bharat Ratna (though the year isn't specified in the source), and the International Gandhi Peace Prize (2001). It also accurately mentions the annual celebration of Nelson Mandela International Day on July 18th by the UN. The inclusion of the awards tests the candidate's recall of significant events.


**5. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion, led by Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav, along with their sisters Phulo and Jhano, took place in the Rajmahal Hills between 1855 and 1857.
2. Karl Marx referred to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution in his book, "Notes on Indian History," and the British enacted the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 in response.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the leaders and location are correct, the rebellion occurred between 1855 and 1856, not 1857. This minor discrepancy in the year is a potential distractor for the candidate.

Statement 2 is correct. Karl Marx did refer to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution in his "Notes on Indian History," and the British did indeed enact the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 as a consequence of the rebellion. The reference to Karl Marx and his work adds a layer of intellectual depth to the question.


**6. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, symbolizing fearlessness, is displayed by the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, and is associated with the posture used by Buddha to tame a mad elephant.
2.  Other mudras associated with Buddha include the Bhumisparsha mudra, which signifies calling the earth to witness, and the Dhyana mudra, which represents the perfect balance of thought and tranquility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  Statement 1 accurately describes the Abhaya Mudra, its symbolism, and its association with Amoghasiddhi and the taming of a mad elephant.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of Buddhist iconography.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the Bhumisparsha Mudra (calling the earth to witness) and the Dhyana Mudra (meditation).  The inclusion of these additional mudras and their meanings adds another layer of complexity and demands a broader understanding of Buddhist symbolism. The question is designed to test the candidate's knowledge of both the Abhaya Mudra and related concepts.


**7. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA and complements Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention.
2. The agreement restricts the importation of all Indian-origin artifacts into the United States, facilitating quicker seizure and repatriation of smuggled antiquities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) primarily focuses on preventing and curbing the illicit trafficking of antiquities between the two countries.  It works in tandem with international efforts, such as Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention. This highlights the international cooperation aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CPA does *not* restrict the importation of *all* Indian-origin artifacts. It targets specific archaeological and ethnological materials deemed to be of significant cultural heritage value, to prevent their illicit trade. The agreement focuses on specific categories and doesn't have a blanket ban, making this a crucial point to understand. The statement is designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the agreement's scope.


**8. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda preached Advaita Vedanta philosophy, delivered a renowned address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893, and established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897.
2. He promoted a scientific temperament, inspiring Jamsetji Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Bangalore in 1909, and is known for his interpretation of the Uttara Mimansa as the core of Vedanta philosophy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate. Statement 1 correctly highlights key aspects of Vivekananda's life and work: his propagation of Advaita Vedanta, his influential address at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, and the founding of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897.  These are well-known facts, but their combination tests recall.

Statement 2 also accurately reflects his advocacy for a scientific temperament, his inspiration to Jamsetji Tata in establishing the IISC (though the year of establishment is important), and his association with the Uttara Mimansa and its interpretation within Vedanta. The subtle detail about the IISC's founding year acts as a distractor.  The question comprehensively tests knowledge of Vivekananda's multifaceted contributions.


**9. With reference to Ratan Tata's accomplishments, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased significantly, and he launched the Tata Nano and received the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.
2. Tata Motors received the PETA India Cow-Friendly Future Award for using vegan interiors in its AVINYA Concept car, and Ratan Tata also received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year – Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct, showcasing Ratan Tata's significant impact on the Tata Group and his recognition through various awards. Statement 1 accurately notes the substantial growth of the Tata Group's revenue under his leadership, the launch of the Tata Nano, and his receipt of the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.

Statement 2 correctly mentions Tata Motors receiving the PETA award for its vegan car interiors and Ratan Tata's recognition with the Ernst & Young Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.  The awards and their associated details act as key points for recall.  The question tests detailed knowledge of Tata's career and achievements.


**10. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India based on recommendations from a formal committee, and recipients receive a monetary grant along with a Sanad and a medallion.
2.  Initially, the award was not conferred posthumously, and Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits recipients from using "Bharat Ratna" as a title.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President, but the process isn't based on formal committee recommendations; it's primarily initiated by the Prime Minister.  Critically, the award does *not* come with a monetary grant.  This financial aspect is a significant detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Initially, posthumous awards were not given. Article 18(1) of the Constitution correctly prohibits the use of "Bharat Ratna" as a title.  The question's structure aims to test the candidate's knowledge of the award's regulations and procedures.  The inclusion of constitutional provisions adds a layer of legal and constitutional understanding.


**11. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a non-violent protest lasting 604 days, began on March 30, 1924, to challenge the exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.
2.  The movement led to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, and E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a crucial role, leading to a significant rift between Gandhi and Periyar over the movement's interpretation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Vaikom Satyagraha. Statement 1 correctly identifies the nature of the protest, its duration (604 days), its start date (March 30, 1924), and its objective—challenging the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from the temple.  The precise duration and dates are crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 correctly points out the eventual outcome—the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936—and highlights Periyar's significant role.  It also correctly notes the divergence of views between Gandhi and Periyar regarding the movement's broader implications, resulting in a significant rift.  The question tests knowledge of social reform movements and their impact.


**12. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, executed on August 9, 1925, involved the looting of a British treasury train near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, to fund revolutionary activities.
2.  Key figures involved in the Kakori Train Action included Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh, and the event marked a significant escalation of revolutionary activities in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Kakori Train Action and its context. Statement 1 correctly identifies the date (August 9, 1925), location (near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh), the target (a British treasury train), and the objective (funding revolutionary activities).  The accuracy of the date is a significant detail.

Statement 2 correctly names key figures involved—Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh—and correctly places the event within the broader context of escalating revolutionary activities during that period.  The question tests knowledge of Indian revolutionary movements and their key participants.  The precise naming of individuals is crucial.


**13. With reference to the delisting of monuments by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI intends to delist monuments deemed "untraceable" and lacking national importance, based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, and the decision is based on Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.
2.  Monuments facing delisting include Kos Minars, and once delisted, the area becomes open for regular construction and urbanization activities, and the term "Missing Monuments" is officially recognized in the AMASR Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The ASI's intention to delist "untraceable" monuments lacking national importance is accurate. The basis of the decision—a report by the Ministry of Culture and Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958—is also correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts. While Kos Minars are among the monuments facing delisting, the statement incorrectly claims that the term "Missing Monuments" is officially recognized in the AMASR Act.  The Act doesn't use this term; it's a description used by the CAG.  Furthermore, while delisting opens up the area for construction, stating it is *open* for such activities is an oversimplification; there are still regulations and processes involved.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the legal framework and its application.


**1. With reference to megalithic structures, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalith, are characterized by their entirely subterranean construction.
2.  Megalithic burial practices exclusively involved chamber tombs, reflecting a uniform funerary tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning they are partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  The text clearly states they are "semi-subterranean chamber tombs". This detail is crucial for understanding their construction and differentiates them from fully subterranean structures.  A common misconception might be to assume all megalithic structures share the same construction methods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials. This diversity contradicts the assertion of a uniform funerary tradition limited only to chamber tombs. The existence of unchambered tombs and non-burial megaliths demonstrates a broader range of purposes and practices associated with these structures.  Understanding this variety is key to a comprehensive understanding of megalithic cultures.  Ignoring this diversity would lead to an incomplete and potentially inaccurate interpretation of their significance.


**2. With reference to the Phanigiri archaeological site, consider the following statements:**

1.  Phanigiri, located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad, is primarily known for its significant Jain religious structures.
2. Excavations at Phanigiri have yielded evidence of the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Phanigiri is located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad, it's explicitly described as a *Buddhist* site, not a Jain site. The text mentions the discovery of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, viharas, and a life-size stucco of Bodhisattva – all key features of Buddhist religious architecture.  Confusing Phanigiri with a Jain site demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the site's religious affiliation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text directly states that the thorana's panel at Phanigiri shows the coexistence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects. This indicates a significant aspect of the site's religious history and demonstrates the complexity of religious practices during that period.  Understanding this coexistence is crucial for interpreting the site's religious and cultural significance within a broader historical context.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bavikonda Monastery, located near Visakhapatnam, is a significant example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture dating back to the 3rd century CE.
2.  The name "Bavikonda" translates to "hill of wells," reflecting the site's historical use for rainwater storage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the Bavikonda Monastery is near Visakhapatnam and dates back to the 3rd century BCE (not CE), it's described as a *Theravada* (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, not Mahayana. This distinction highlights the different schools of Buddhist thought and their architectural manifestations.  Confusing Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism demonstrates a lack of understanding of fundamental differences within Buddhism itself.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly explains that the name "Bavikonda" means "hill of wells," referring to the historical presence of wells used for rainwater harvesting.  This detail provides valuable context about the site's practical aspects and its integration within its environment.  This seemingly minor detail showcases the importance of paying attention to seemingly less significant information that can enhance the overall understanding of a historical site.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but not Sri Lanka.
2.  The Chola navy's victory at Kandalursalai resulted in the destruction of the Pandya navy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Rajendra I's naval conquests included Sri Lanka, resulting in the island becoming a Chola province.  His expeditions also reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  The statement incorrectly limits the extent of Rajendra I's conquests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions Rajaraja I's destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. This subtle difference demonstrates the importance of accurate attribution in historical accounts.  Confusing the Chera and Pandya kingdoms shows a lack of specific knowledge of South Indian political geography during the Chola period.


**5. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a modern practice of seasonal livestock movement primarily driven by economic factors.
2. In India, transhumance is predominantly practiced in the Himalayan region and is associated with several nomadic tribes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text defines transhumance as a *traditional* practice, not a modern one.  It emphasizes the historical and cultural aspects of this seasonal livestock movement, which often involves the migration of human communities alongside their herds.  Characterizing it solely as a modern, economically driven practice overlooks its long-standing cultural significance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes such as Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas.  It further mentions the practice's presence in plains regions, demonstrating a wider geographical distribution.  Understanding the geographical and cultural aspects of transhumance in India is crucial for comprehending its impact on pastoral communities and their livelihoods.


**6. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem written in Sanskrit, is included in the register.
2. The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works alongside works from other Asia-Pacific countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ramcharitmanas is indeed included in the register, it's stated to be written in *Awadhi*, not Sanskrit, and in the 16th century, not the 17th century. This highlights the importance of accurate details in historical and literary contexts.  The error in language and chronology shows a lack of precise knowledge about the work itself.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the register includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works (Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana) *along with* 17 other works from the Asia-Pacific region.  This demonstrates the international scope of the MoW program and its aim to preserve documentary heritage across various regions.


**7. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*, which is known for its ability to produce silk without harming the moth.
2. Eri silk is renowned as the world's only vegan silk due to the method of harvesting the cocoons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori*.  *Bombyx mori* produces mulberry silk.  This shows the importance of knowing the specific species associated with different types of silk production.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly highlights that Eri silk is known as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to exit the cocoon naturally, unlike in the production of other silk types.  This ethical aspect of Eri silk production is a key factor in its growing popularity.


**8. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act empowers the state governments to delist monuments that are deemed to be of no national importance.
2.  Section 4 of the AMASR Act empowers the Central Government to declare monuments of national importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act empowers the *Central*, not state, government to delist monuments that are deemed to lack national importance. This reflects the centralized nature of the legal framework for the protection of ancient monuments.  Attributing this power to state governments demonstrates a misunderstanding of the Act's provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 4 of the AMASR Act explicitly grants the Central Government the authority to declare monuments of national importance.  This is a key provision for determining which monuments receive protection under the Act.


**9. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Nalanda University campus was established based on a decision made at the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS).
2.  The ancient Nalanda University was renowned for its strict merit-based admissions and its vast library, known as "Dharma Gunj."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The decision to establish the new Nalanda University was made at the *2nd*, not 1st, East Asia Summit (EAS).  This seemingly minor detail demonstrates the importance of precise chronological accuracy in historical contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the ancient Nalanda University's strict merit-based admissions process and its extensive library, "Dharma Gunj."  These details highlight the institution's academic rigor and its significance as a center of learning.


**10. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when Lord Buddha gave his first sermon at Sarnath.
2.  The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya is associated with the event commemorated by IAD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Sankassiya, not his first sermon at Sarnath.  Confusing these two significant events demonstrates a lack of knowledge of key events in the life of Buddha.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly links the Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya to the event commemorated by IAD.  This pillar serves as a historical marker associated with this significant event in Buddhist history.


**11. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the repatriation of illicitly trafficked antiquities from the USA to India.
2. The CPA is primarily focused on preventing the illicit trafficking of only archaeological material from India to the USA.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text states that the CPA aims to curb illicit trafficking and help in the quick seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities to India.  This highlights the agreement's focus on returning stolen artifacts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPA does restrict the importation of archaeological material, it also includes *ethnological* material of Indian origin.  This broader scope demonstrates a more comprehensive approach to protecting India's cultural heritage.  Restricting the scope to only archaeological material misrepresents the agreement's provisions.


**12. With reference to the South African Anti-Apartheid Struggle, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) primarily focused on internal resistance within South Africa, with minimal international involvement.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi's contributions to the struggle were limited to his establishment of the Natal Indian Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text highlights that the AAM involved both internal and *external* campaigns, including international efforts to impose sanctions on the apartheid regime.  This demonstrates a multifaceted approach to the struggle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi did establish the Natal Indian Congress, his contributions extended far beyond that, including the establishment of the Phoenix Settlement and leading Satyagraha movements.  The statement significantly understates Gandhi's substantial role in the struggle.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence across Southeast Asia, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did consolidate Chola power along the Coromandel Coast, his naval expeditions extended far beyond the Bay of Bengal.  His destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and his conquests of Sri Lanka and the Maldives demonstrate a clear expansionist naval policy reaching into the Indian Ocean.  The statement misrepresents the scope of his maritime achievements, downplaying the significant geopolitical impact of his naval dominance.


Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire represents a major expansion of Chola power into Southeast Asia. The conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra marked a significant turning point, demonstrating the reach and power of the Chola navy and establishing a considerable Chola presence in the region. This expansion is well-documented historically and represents a key aspect of Chola imperial ambitions.  The success of this expedition solidified the Chola's reputation as a major maritime power in the Indian Ocean.


Option (a) is incorrect because it underestimates Rajaraja I's naval achievements. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 accurately reflects the historical record.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the geographical extent and the strategic implications of the Chola naval expeditions.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a practice primarily confined to mountainous regions, with limited application in plains areas due to the lack of suitable seasonal pastures.
2. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative focuses solely on preserving the traditional practices of European pastoral communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in mountainous regions like the Himalayas,  the practice also exists in plains areas such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly limits the geographical scope of transhumance, failing to acknowledge its diversity across different terrains and ecological zones.  The existence of transhumance in plains regions demonstrates the adaptability of the practice to various environments.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, is not limited to European pastoral communities. Although it recognizes transhumance traditions in Europe (as evidenced by the inclusion of "Transhumance in 10 European States" and "Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland" on the Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity list), its broader aim is to protect and promote transhumance practices globally. The statement incorrectly restricts the initiative's focus, ignoring its international scope and inclusive approach to cultural heritage preservation.


Option (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because both statements present an incomplete and inaccurate picture of transhumance and the related initiative.  Option (d) is correct because both statements contain misleading or false information, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the subject.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical spread of transhumance and the global reach of the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts signifies a bias towards religious texts, neglecting other significant literary works from the region.
2. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register exclusively features manuscripts originating from the Asia-Pacific region, excluding works from other parts of the world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the three Indian works mentioned are indeed religious or philosophical in nature (epic poem, fables, poetics), the inclusion of these manuscripts does not automatically signify a bias towards religious texts.  The selection process for the MoW register likely considers various criteria, including historical significance, cultural impact, and preservation needs.  The statement makes an unwarranted assumption about the selection criteria and ignores the possibility that the chosen manuscripts represent a broader range of literary genres and themes within the selected group of 17 other works.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The question states that the three Indian literary works were included *along with 17 other works from the region*. This clearly indicates that the register is not exclusive to the Asia-Pacific region, although the focus is naturally on the documentary heritage of that region. The statement incorrectly asserts exclusivity, ignoring the broader context provided in the information.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain inaccurate or misleading information. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements misrepresent the facts regarding the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register's scope and selection process. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the MoW program and its regional registers, testing their ability to critically evaluate information about the selection criteria and the geographical scope of the register.


**4. With reference to Abhaya Mudra and other Buddhist Mudras, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, a symbol of fearlessness, is exclusively associated with the Buddha Shakyamuni, representing his triumph over Mara.
2. The Bhumisparsha Mudra signifies the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment through meditation, representing a state of deep tranquility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra is indeed a symbol of fearlessness, it is not exclusively associated with Shakyamuni Buddha.  The provided text explicitly states that it is displayed by Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Dhyani Buddha.  Therefore, the statement incorrectly restricts the association of the mudra to a single Buddha figure. The statement demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the different Buddhist traditions and iconography.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra, while related to meditation, does not signify the attainment of enlightenment through meditation.  The text clarifies that it represents Shakyamuni's overcoming of Mara's obstructions *while meditating on Truth*.  The statement confuses the specific meaning of the mudra with the broader context of Buddha's spiritual journey.  The statement demonstrates a misunderstanding of the symbolic significance of the Bhumisparsha Mudra.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the symbolic meanings and associations of the Buddhist mudras. Option (d) is correct because both statements present incomplete or inaccurate information, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of Buddhist iconography and symbolism. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between subtle nuances in Buddhist symbolism and their understanding of the different mudras and their associated meanings.


**5. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA primarily aims to facilitate the return of Indian antiquities currently held in private collections within the USA, regardless of their legal acquisition.
2. The 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property provides a comprehensive global framework for the repatriation of all stolen cultural artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CPA's primary aim is to prevent and curb the *illicit trafficking* of antiquities from India to the USA.  The agreement focuses on preventing future illegal transfers rather than addressing existing private collections.  The statement misrepresents the CPA's core objective, confusing prevention with repatriation.  The statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of the legal framework surrounding the protection of cultural heritage.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention is indeed relevant to preventing illicit trafficking, it does not provide a comprehensive global framework for the repatriation of *all* stolen cultural artifacts.  Repatriation is a complex process involving bilateral agreements and legal challenges.  The statement oversimplifies the complexities of international cultural property law and the challenges associated with the return of stolen artifacts.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the scope and limitations of the CPA and the 1970 UNESCO Convention. Option (d) is correct because both statements present an oversimplified and incomplete understanding of the legal frameworks governing the protection and repatriation of cultural property.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of international legal instruments related to cultural heritage protection and the limitations of such agreements in achieving complete repatriation of stolen artifacts.  It requires careful attention to detail and nuanced understanding of legal frameworks.


**6. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in the immediate and complete destruction of the Kalinga kingdom, leaving no lasting cultural impact.
2. Kharavela's reign is primarily known for his military conquests, with minimal evidence of cultural patronage or architectural achievements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Kalinga War (261 BCE) did lead to the Mauryan annexation of Kalinga, but it did not result in the complete destruction of the Kalinga kingdom or its cultural legacy.  The Kalinga culture continued to exist, and the region retained its distinct identity.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate portrayal of the consequences of the war, failing to recognize the persistence of Kalinga culture and its subsequent influence.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  Kharavela's reign is well-known for both his military campaigns *and* his significant cultural patronage.  The Hathigumpha inscription provides details of his reign, highlighting his support for Jainism and his involvement in the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.  The statement incorrectly minimizes Kharavela's cultural contributions, focusing solely on his military achievements.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the Kalinga War and Kharavela's reign. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements misrepresent the historical record, requiring the candidate to possess detailed knowledge about the Kalinga Dynasty and its cultural and political impact. The question tests the candidate's ability to analyze historical events and avoid generalizations based on incomplete information.  It demands a nuanced understanding of the Kalinga Dynasty's legacy beyond military conquests.


**7. With reference to the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ooragutta site is characterized by the presence of sophisticated urban structures, indicating a high level of societal organization during the Iron Age.
2. The rock art sites at Damaratogu feature predominantly human figures engaged in warfare or hunting activities, providing insights into their social dynamics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text describes Ooragutta as an Iron Age *megalithic* site.  Megalithic sites are typically associated with burial practices and do not necessarily indicate sophisticated urban structures. The statement incorrectly assumes a level of urban development not supported by the provided information.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the rock art site at Devarlabanda Mula (not Damaratogu, which is another site) has only depictions of animals and no humans or weapons. While other sites may have different characteristics, this specific detail contradicts the statement. The statement makes an inaccurate generalization about the characteristics of the rock art sites in the region.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements misinterpret or misrepresent the information provided about the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements present inaccurate or incomplete information.  The question tests the candidate's ability to carefully read and interpret descriptive information, avoiding generalizations and focusing on specific details.  The question demands a precise understanding of the characteristics of various archaeological sites.


**8.  With reference to the National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1. The selection of August 7th as National Handloom Day commemorates the anniversary of the Dandi March, a pivotal event in India's struggle for independence.
2. The handloom industry in India is predominantly characterized by the employment of men, with a relatively small proportion of women involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  National Handloom Day commemorates the Swadeshi Movement launched on August 7, 1905, not the Dandi March.  The statement confuses two significant events in Indian history, indicating a lack of precise knowledge about the historical context of National Handloom Day.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that 70% of weavers and allied workers in the Indian handloom industry are women.  The statement presents a completely inaccurate representation of the gender dynamics within the handloom sector.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual errors regarding the historical context and gender composition of the Indian handloom industry. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements are factually incorrect, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific details related to National Handloom Day and the Indian handloom industry.  The question requires precise recall of facts and demonstrates the importance of accuracy in understanding socio-economic realities.


**9. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm Bombyx mori, which is also responsible for the production of mulberry silk.
2. The Oeko-Tex certification for Eri silk guarantees its production adheres to stringent environmental and social standards, including fair labor practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori* (which produces mulberry silk).  The statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of the different types of silkworms and their respective silk products.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Oeko-Tex certification does ensure the Eri silk is tested for harmful substances and produced in environmentally friendly conditions, the text does *not* explicitly state that it guarantees adherence to stringent social standards, including fair labor practices.  The statement makes an unwarranted assumption about the scope of the Oeko-Tex certification.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the silkworm species involved in Eri silk production and the precise scope of the Oeko-Tex certification. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements are factually incorrect, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific details related to Eri silk and its production process.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the differences between various types of silk and the limitations of certifications in guaranteeing complete social compliance.



**10. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

1.  Denisovans were a species of hominid that lived exclusively in the Siberian region, with no evidence of their presence in other parts of Asia.
2.  Genetic evidence suggests that Denisovans interbred only with Neanderthals, with no evidence of interbreeding with modern humans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that Denisovans may have ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia during the last Ice Age.  The statement incorrectly limits their geographical distribution, demonstrating a lack of understanding of their wide range across Asia.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that DNA evidence suggests Denisovans interbred with both Neanderthals *and* modern humans.  The statement incorrectly restricts their interbreeding to only one hominid species.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual errors regarding the geographical distribution and interbreeding patterns of Denisovans. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements are factually incorrect, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific details about Denisovans and their relationship to other hominid species. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of paleoanthropology and their ability to interpret genetic evidence related to hominid evolution.


**1. With reference to Megalithic culture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic monument, are exclusively found in the southern regions of India.
2. Megalithic burials always include elaborate grave goods indicative of a complex social hierarchy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Dolmenoid cists are prevalent in South India,  their distribution isn't limited to that region.  Megalithic culture spread across various parts of the Indian subcontinent, and similar burial structures are found in other areas.  The statement incorrectly restricts their geographical location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The presence of grave goods in megalithic burials varied considerably depending on the region, time period, and social status of the deceased.  While some burials contained rich grave goods suggesting social stratification, many others were simpler, indicating a diversity of burial practices and social structures within megalithic societies. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate generalization about the uniformity of burial practices.  The diversity of grave goods and their absence in some cases reflect a complex reality rather than a simple social hierarchy.


**2. With reference to ancient Indian universities, consider the following statements:**

1. Vikramshila University was primarily known for its focus on Buddhist philosophy, excluding other disciplines.
2. Nalanda University was significantly larger in size and student population than Vikramshila University.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Vikramshila University, while renowned for its Buddhist studies, was a multidisciplinary center of learning encompassing various subjects beyond Buddhist philosophy. Its curriculum included grammar, logic, medicine, and other disciplines. The statement presents a limited and inaccurate view of the university's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both Nalanda and Vikramshila were prominent universities, their relative sizes and student populations are subjects of scholarly debate and are not definitively established.  There is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that Nalanda was uniformly larger than Vikramshila. The statement presents an unsubstantiated comparison.


**3. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalinga War, fought in 261 BCE, resulted in the immediate and complete destruction of the Kalinga kingdom.
2. Kharavela's reign is primarily known for his extensive patronage of Buddhism, neglecting other religious traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War, while a significant event resulting in the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire, did not lead to the kingdom's complete destruction.  Kalinga continued to exist as a part of the Mauryan Empire, and its culture and identity persisted.  The statement overstates the impact of the war.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kharavela is known for his patronage of Jainism, evidenced by his construction of caves and his Hathigumpha inscription, his reign also saw the coexistence of other religious traditions. His rule did not focus exclusively on Jainism, neglecting other forms of religious belief and practice. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of Kharavela's religious policy.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions were primarily focused on establishing trade routes and securing commercial interests, not territorial conquests.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire resulted in the immediate and lasting annexation of the entire Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions certainly secured trade routes and commercial interests, they also involved significant territorial conquests, particularly in Sri Lanka and the destruction of rival naval forces. The statement understates the military and territorial ambitions of his naval campaigns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra Chola I's expeditions to the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, it did not lead to the complete and permanent annexation of the entire region.  The Chola influence in Southeast Asia was significant but not total or enduring. The statement overstates the extent and permanence of Chola control in Southeast Asia.


**5. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings held absolute power, unchecked by any form of council or ministerial influence.
2. The Ahom Dynasty's downfall was solely due to internal conflicts and a lack of strong leadership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ahom political system, while a monarchy, involved a powerful council of ministers (Patra Mantris) who played a crucial role in the appointment and governance of the kingdom.  The king's power was not absolute but was significantly influenced by the council. The statement misrepresents the nature of Ahom political power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While internal conflicts played a role in the Ahom Dynasty's decline, their downfall was also significantly influenced by external factors, primarily the Burmese invasions and subsequent British annexation following the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826. The statement presents an incomplete and inaccurate explanation for the dynasty's end.


**6. With reference to  religious sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kamakhya Devi Temple in Assam is solely associated with the Shaivite tradition, excluding any other religious influences.
2. The Alagar Temple in Tamil Nadu is exclusively dedicated to Lord Shiva, and does not associate with any other deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kamakhya Devi Temple, while significantly associated with Shaktism, is also a site of convergence for beliefs and practices from both Aryan and non-Aryan traditions. Its religious significance is not limited to Shaivism. The statement incorrectly simplifies the temple's religious associations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Alagar Temple, while primarily dedicated to Lord Vishnu (as Kallazhagar), is also associated with other deities and religious traditions. Its historical and cultural significance extends beyond a singular deity. The statement incorrectly restricts the temple's religious associations.


**7. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple is a prime example of the Nagara style of temple architecture.
2. The original shrine of the Virupaksha Temple was built during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is a prime example of the Dravida style of temple architecture, characterized by its gopurams, vimana, and intricate carvings. The statement incorrectly identifies the architectural style.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara Empire greatly expanded and enhanced the Virupaksha Temple, its earliest shrine was constructed much earlier, in 740 CE, by Chalukyan Queen Lokamahadevi. The statement misrepresents the temple's origins.


**8. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ratna Bhandar contains only the jewels of Lord Jagannath, excluding those of other deities associated with the temple.
2. The temple's architecture is a unique blend of Nagara and Dravida styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ratna Bhandar, the sacred treasury, contains jewels not only of Lord Jagannath but also those of other deities worshipped at the temple, namely, Devi Subhadra and Lord Balabhadra.  The statement incorrectly limits the contents of the treasury.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The temple's architecture is primarily of the Kalinga style, a distinct substyle within the Nagara style, and it does not represent a fusion of Nagara and Dravida styles. The statement incorrectly describes the architectural style.


**9. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's main structure is an example of the Dravida style of architecture.
2. The Vajrasana, located within the temple complex, was originally installed by Emperor Ashoka to mark the spot where Buddha sat and meditated.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The main temple structure at Bodh Gaya is not Dravidian in style; it is primarily a classical Indian temple architecture with a curvilinear shikhara.  The statement misidentifies the architectural style.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vajrasana, the diamond throne, is a significant element of the Mahabodhi Temple complex, and historical accounts support its installation by Emperor Ashoka to mark the site of Buddha's enlightenment. The statement accurately reflects historical accounts.


**10. With reference to  the Chandravalli Cave Complex, consider the following statements:**

1.  The cave complex is solely associated with the Vijayanagara period, with no evidence of earlier or later occupation.
2. The cave complex's chambers include only religious spaces and lack any evidence of residential or secular use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chandravalli Cave Complex shows evidence of habitation and use across multiple periods, including the Satavahana, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara periods, indicating continuous occupation over a longer span of time. The statement incorrectly limits the complex's historical association.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The cave complex's chambers include spaces for religious practices (Shiva linga), but also areas that suggest residential and secular uses (rooms for visitors and sadhus, drawing room, bedroom, etc.).  The statement incorrectly restricts the functions of the chambers within the complex.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquest extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that Rajaraja I destroyed the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  This is a crucial distinction in South Indian history, reflecting different regional power dynamics.  The Pandya and Chera kingdoms were distinct entities, often rivals to the Cholas. Confusing these two would demonstrate a lack of nuanced understanding of the period.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Rajendra I's significant naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion highlights the reach and power of the Chola navy, extending their influence far beyond the Indian subcontinent.  The successful campaign against a powerful maritime empire like the Sailendra demonstrates Chola naval prowess and strategic capabilities.  Understanding this expansion is important for comprehending the scope of Chola imperial power and its impact on maritime trade and regional politics.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2022.
2.  In India, transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region by tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis, involving the seasonal movement of sheep and goats between subalpine/alpine pastures and adjoining plains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland *was* declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, the text specifies that this occurred in 2023, not 2022.  Precision in dates is crucial for demonstrating a thorough understanding of historical events and cultural designations.  A seemingly minor error in the year can indicate a lack of attention to detail in factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The description accurately reflects the practice of transhumance in the Indian Himalayas, detailing the involvement of specific nomadic tribes (Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis), the types of livestock (sheep and goats), and the seasonal movement pattern between higher altitude pastures in summer and lower-lying plains in winter. This illustrates a clear understanding of the geographical context and socio-economic aspects of transhumance in India.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Beijing, China.
2. Manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works included in the register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This highlights the importance of accurate geographical knowledge and attention to detail in recalling international events.  Confusing the location of a significant international meeting demonstrates a lack of precision in factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly lists Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana as Indian literary works included in the UNESCO's MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This demonstrates an understanding of the significance of these works and their recognition within the international cultural heritage framework.  Knowing which specific works were included showcases knowledge beyond general awareness of the program.


**4. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra is a posture associated with the second Dhyani Buddha, Akshobhya.
2. It symbolizes fearlessness and is depicted in Buddhist art as a gesture used to tame a mad elephant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that the Abhaya Mudra is associated with the *fifth* Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not the second, Akshobhya.  This highlights the need for precise knowledge of Buddhist iconography and the characteristics of different Buddhas.  Mistaking the identity of the Buddha associated with a specific mudra demonstrates a superficial understanding of the subject.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the Abhaya Mudra symbolizes fearlessness and is depicted as a gesture used to tame a mad elephant in Buddhist art, signifying the Buddha's power and compassion.  This demonstrates an understanding of the symbolism and artistic representation of the mudra within its religious context.


**5. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to facilitate the rapid return of smuggled Indian antiquities from the USA to India but does not restrict the import of such items into the USA.
2.  Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property provides a global framework for preventing the smuggling of antiquities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the agreement aims to *prevent and curb* the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities to the USA, and it *restricts* the importation of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin.  The statement incorrectly portrays the agreement's purpose and scope, suggesting a misunderstanding of its key provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly identifies Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention as a global legal framework aimed at preventing the illicit trafficking of cultural property. This demonstrates awareness of international legal instruments related to cultural heritage protection.  Knowing the specific article number and the convention's purpose shows a deeper understanding of international efforts to combat cultural theft.


**6. With reference to National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1. National Handloom Day is celebrated annually on August 7th to commemorate the launch of the Swadeshi Movement in 1905.
2.  The handloom industry in India employs more men than women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately states that National Handloom Day is celebrated on August 7th to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement, launched on that date in 1905. This demonstrates an understanding of the historical context and significance of the day. Connecting the celebration to a specific historical event shows knowledge beyond simply knowing the date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that 70% of weavers and allied workers in the Indian handloom industry are women.  This directly contradicts the statement, highlighting the importance of understanding gender dynamics within the Indian handloom sector.  A false statement regarding the gender distribution within the workforce reveals a lack of attention to detail.


**7. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*, which is also used for the production of mulberry silk.
2. Eri silk is known as the world's only vegan silk because the silkworm is not killed during the cocoon harvesting process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori*, which is the silkworm used for mulberry silk production. This demonstrates the importance of knowing the specific species involved in different silk production processes.  Confusing the silkworm species reveals a lack of precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Eri silk as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, unlike in other silk production methods where the silkworm is killed. This highlights the unique characteristics and ethical considerations associated with Eri silk production.  Understanding the ethical implications of the process is crucial for a comprehensive understanding.


**8. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

1.  Denisovans are an extinct hominid species closely related to Neanderthals but not to modern humans.
2.  Fossil evidence suggests Denisovans inhabited regions spanning from Siberia to Southeast Asia during the last Ice Age.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Denisovans are related to both Neanderthals *and* modern humans, suggesting interbreeding between these groups.  This demonstrates the importance of understanding the complex evolutionary relationships within the hominin family.  An incomplete or inaccurate understanding of these relationships reveals a lack of knowledge in evolutionary biology.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly points out that DNA and fossil evidence suggests Denisovans inhabited a wide geographical range, from Siberia to Southeast Asia, during the last Ice Age. This demonstrates an understanding of the geographical distribution and temporal context of this extinct hominin species.


**9. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was formed in 1928 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the following year.
2. The Khelo India program is one of the initiatives undertaken by the IOA to promote sports at the grassroots level.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the IOA was formed in 1927 and recognized by the IOC in the *same* year.  This demonstrates the importance of accuracy in recalling historical dates and events related to the formation of sporting organizations.  A mistake in the year indicates a lack of precision in historical knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions the Khelo India program as an initiative to promote sports, it is a government program, not directly under the purview of the IOA.  The IOA coordinates with National Sports Federations but does not manage government-led programs.  This highlights the difference between government initiatives and the role of national sporting bodies.


**10. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in 1893 was instrumental in promoting the Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the 1893 Parliament of Religions significantly popularized Vedanta philosophy in the West.  His speech showcased the philosophical depth and spiritual richness of Hinduism. While he preached Vedanta philosophy, which incorporates Advaita, the statement is not inaccurate.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  While he did establish the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897,  it's not solely focused on religious education; it also engages in widespread social service, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges. The statement misrepresents the scope of the Ramakrishna Mission's activities.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that the Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion under Ratan Tata's leadership, not $10 billion.  This highlights the importance of precise figures when discussing economic growth and corporate performance.  An inaccurate figure demonstrates a lack of attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately mentions Tata Motors receiving the PETA India award for using vegan interiors in its AVINYA Concept car, showcasing the company's commitment to ethical and sustainable practices.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is granted by the *President* of India, not the Prime Minister, based on recommendations (although no formal process is explicitly required).  The statement incorrectly identifies the awarding authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifically states that the Bharat Ratna does *not* come with any monetary grant.  This highlights the difference between honorary awards and financial incentives.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the award.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE led to Kalinga's annexation by the *Mauryan*, not the Gupta Empire. This highlights the importance of knowing the correct empire involved in a historical event.  Confusing the Mauryan and Gupta empires demonstrates a lack of understanding of Indian historical chronology.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and the significance of the Hathigumpha inscription as a historical source.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed India's highest cinema award, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, and includes Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, and Waheeda Rehman among its recipients, the cash prize amount is stated as ₹10 lakhs, not exceeding ₹20 lakhs.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Rajaraja Chola I annexed the *northern* part of Sri Lanka, not the southern part.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the celestial realm to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh, not Lumbini in Nepal.  The text also mentions the coincidence with the Pavāraņā festival, marking the end of the Rainy Retreat, but not the *start* of the retreat.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions the celebration of the declaration of Pali, not Sanskrit, as a classical language by the Cabinet. This is a crucial linguistic detail that renders the statement factually inaccurate.


**7. With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the US, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from the USA to India, restricting the importation of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of American origin into India.
2.  The agreement facilitates the quicker seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities from the USA, aligning with global efforts such as the UNESCO 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPA's aim is to prevent illicit trafficking of *Indian* antiquities to the *USA*, not vice-versa. The agreement restricts the importation of specific Indian materials into the USA, not American materials into India. This reversal of the flow of artifacts makes the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 2 correctly summarizes the CPA's purpose and its alignment with international efforts to combat the illicit trade of cultural artifacts.  The agreement is indeed intended to expedite the seizure and return of Indian antiquities illegally exported to the USA, working in concert with the UNESCO 1970 Convention.


**8. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 1954 by the then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the award is India's highest civilian honour, with recipients allowed to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix to their names.
2.  Among the initial recipients were Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, Dr. C.V. Raman, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari;  the award has never been conferred posthumously.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bharat Ratna is indeed India's highest civilian honor, established in 1954,  the text explicitly states that Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits awardees from using "Bharat Ratna" as a title prefix or suffix. They can mention the award in their biodata, but not use it as a title.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text clearly states that initially the award was *not* conferred posthumously, but this changed in 1966.  The statement thus contains a factual error regarding the posthumous conferral of the award.


**9. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Instituted in 1954 as "State Awards," the awards are currently administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals and encompass categories for feature films, non-feature films, and best writing, but not for regional cinema.
2.  The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is presented alongside the National Film Awards, recognizing states that have significantly contributed to the growth of the Indian film industry.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Film Awards were indeed instituted in 1954 as "State Awards" and are currently administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, encompassing feature films, non-feature films, and best writing, the text mentions awards *were* given for regional films in earlier years.  The omission of this fact makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the information in the provided text. The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is indeed presented alongside the National Film Awards to recognize states supportive of the film industry's growth.


**10. With reference to the  "untraceable" monuments  considered for delisting by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) intends to delist 18 centrally protected monuments due to their lack of national importance, and these monuments were not protected under the ASI before their consideration for delisting.
2. Among the monuments facing delisting are Kos Minar No. 13 (Haryana), Gunner Burkill's tomb (Jhansi), and Telia Nala ruins (Varanasi), and the decision was based on a report by the Ministry of Tourism.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that the 18 monuments *were* protected under the ASI *before* the consideration for delisting.  The statement incorrectly claims they were not previously protected.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the decision to delist the monuments was based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Tourism.  This is a critical detail that makes the statement factually inaccurate.  The text explicitly mentions the Ministry of Culture's involvement in the decision-making process.


**1. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  It aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by employing blockchain technology for complete traceability and certification.

A key component of this strategy is using blockchain technology to guarantee complete traceability and certification, thereby building trust and transparency within the supply chain. This enhances the brand's credibility and competitiveness in the international market.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The initiative's implementation is spearheaded by the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL).  The initiative empowers all ginners (those who separate cotton fiber from seeds) across India to produce and brand their cotton under the Kasturi Cotton Bharat label, signifying a significant shift toward a more inclusive and regulated system within the Indian cotton industry.  This broad empowerment is crucial for the success of the initiative's goals.

Statement 2 is also correct. Delhi is the location for the project's initial phase.  The initiative involves over 150 artists from across India, showcasing the rich diversity of Indian art forms.

A notable feature of the museum is its inclusion of one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, showcasing a commitment to environmental sustainability and ecological restoration. The presence of the Miyawaki forest demonstrates a commitment to sustainable development.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The museum serves as a poignant memorial to the victims of the devastating 2001 Gujarat earthquake.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian honor, bestowed by the President of India. While there is no formal process for recommendations, the Prime Minister typically plays a key role in suggesting recipients.  While three is the general limit, exceptions have been made, indicating a degree of flexibility in the application of this rule. The statement accurately describes the award's position and process.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion.  The award notably lacks a monetary component.  Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution explicitly prohibits the use of 'Bharat Ratna' as a title, prefix, or suffix to one's name, maintaining the award's unique status. The statement highlights the specific regulations surrounding the award's acceptance.

The statement accurately lists the order of precedence of these awards, from the highest (Param Vir Chakra) to the lowest (Shaurya Chakra). The precise order of precedence is a crucial piece of information.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The establishment of these awards occurred in two phases: wartime gallantry awards (Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950, while peacetime gallantry awards (initially Ashoka Chakra Class I, II, and III, later renamed Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra) were introduced in 1952.  The distinction between wartime and peacetime awards is significant in understanding their context.  The statement accurately describes the two phases and types of awards.

The statement correctly identifies the awarding body and the source of the award criteria.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The fundamental aim of the Anubhav Awards is to improve governance and administrative practices.  By gathering and recognizing the experiences of retiring employees, the government aims to learn from past practices and incorporate valuable insights into future policies and procedures.

**1. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. He significantly contributed to the urban planning of Bombay, designing its buildings, streets, and avenues.
2. He established the Native School of Bombay, which later evolved into Elphinstone College.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth played a crucial role in shaping the urban landscape of Bombay.  He was instrumental in planning and developing the city's infrastructure, including its buildings, streets, and avenues. This contribution significantly impacted Bombay's growth and development into a major metropolis. His urban planning efforts are a testament to his vision and foresight.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shankarseth was a significant philanthropist who supported education, he did *not* found the Native School of Bombay which later became Elphinstone College.  That institution's founding is attributed to others.  The confusion might arise from the fact that he *did* donate land for educational institutions, emphasizing girls' education, but this was not the specific institution mentioned in the statement.  The question deliberately uses this close but inaccurate detail to act as a distractor.


**2. With reference to Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. He advocated for a return to Vedic principles, emphasizing the infallible authority of the Vedas, while rejecting idolatry and ritualistic worship.
2. His social reform efforts included advocating for widow remarriage and women's education, but he strongly supported the hereditary caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a core tenet of Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy.  He championed a return to what he perceived as the pure, original Vedic teachings, rejecting practices he deemed as later accretions. His emphasis on the Vedas as the ultimate authority is central to his reformist ideology. The rejection of idolatry and ritualistic excesses was a key aspect of this return to Vedic principles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Dayanand Saraswati did advocate for social reforms such as widow remarriage and women's education,  he did *not* support the hereditary caste system. In fact, he actively worked against the rigidities of the caste system and the practice of untouchability, advocating for a more fluid and meritocratic social order based on individual talent and disposition. The statement deliberately inverts this crucial aspect of his social reform agenda to create a challenging distractor.


**3. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty was a part of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside prominent members like the Bhonsle of Nagpur and the Gaekwad of Baroda.
2. Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War led to the Treaty of Mandsaur, which established a system of joint rule between the Holkars and the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Holkar Dynasty was indeed a significant part of the Maratha Confederacy, a loose alliance of Maratha states. The statement accurately mentions other prominent members of the Confederacy, highlighting the Holkars' place within this larger political entity.  This provides context for understanding the dynasty's history and power dynamics within the broader Maratha landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War did lead to the Treaty of Mandsaur, it did *not* establish a system of joint rule. The treaty effectively brought the Holkar state under British paramountcy, significantly reducing their sovereignty and placing them under British control. The statement misrepresents the nature of the treaty's outcome, making it a strong distractor. The treaty established British supremacy, not joint rule.


**4. With reference to Ratan Naval Tata's legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Under his leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased dramatically, and it became one of the largest employers in India.
2.  Tata Motors received the PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for the use of leather interiors in its Avinya Concept car.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Ratan Tata's leadership saw an unprecedented expansion of the Tata Group.  The massive increase in revenue and the group's status as a major employer in India are well-documented aspects of his tenure. This exemplifies his successful business acumen and the group's impact on the Indian economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement is factually incorrect regarding the materials used in the Avinya Concept car and the award received. While Tata Motors did receive an award from PETA India for its commitment to using vegan, eco-friendly materials, the car used *vegan* interiors, not leather.  The incorrect detail about leather interiors serves as a deliberate and plausible distractor.


**5. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India upon the recommendation of a dedicated selection committee.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a substantial monetary grant in addition to the Sanad (certificate) and medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India, but it is not based on the recommendation of a dedicated selection committee.  While there's no formal process, the Prime Minister's recommendation plays a significant role in the decision-making process. The absence of a formal committee is a key detail that makes this a challenging statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna does *not* include a monetary grant.  The award consists solely of the Sanad (certificate) and a medallion. The inclusion of a monetary component is a completely false detail intended to mislead candidates.  This lack of monetary reward is a notable feature of the award.



**6. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works such as the *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*.
2. The MoW Programme was launched in 2002 and maintains only a single, global register of documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The inclusion of the specified Indian literary works in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register is accurately stated. This reflects the importance of preserving these works as part of the world's documentary heritage.  The detail about specific works tests factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MoW Programme was launched in 1992, not 2002, and it maintains multiple registers—International, Regional, and National—to categorize and preserve documentary heritage. The incorrect launch year and the false detail about a single register serve as effective distractors.


**7. With reference to Yoga and its history, consider the following statements:**

1. The word "Yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to join," symbolizing the unity of mind and body.
2.  Systematic references to yoga practices first appear in Patanjali's *Mahabhashya*, a comprehensive grammatical treatise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The etymology of the word "Yoga" and its symbolic meaning are accurately described. This reflects a basic understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of yoga.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Patanjali is a crucial figure in the history of yoga, systematic references to yoga practices are primarily found in his *Yogasutra*, not his *Mahabhashya*. The *Mahabhashya* is a grammatical work, not a text on yoga philosophy or practice.  The substitution of *Yogasutra* with *Mahabhashya* is a key element making this a difficult distractor.


**8.  With reference to the  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 3 of the Act prevents the export of antiquities outside India and provides a clear legal framework for their protection.
2.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is responsible for the coordination and recovery of all smuggled or illegally trafficked cultural artifacts, regardless of their origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, explicitly prohibits the export of antiquities, providing a crucial legal mechanism for the protection of India's cultural heritage. This showcases a key legal aspect of preserving India's cultural assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the ASI plays a vital role in the coordination and recovery of antiquities, their responsibility is primarily limited to antiquities *traced within India*.  The statement expands their responsibility beyond their actual jurisdiction, serving as a misleading distractor.  The ASI's role is important but is not as broadly defined as the statement suggests.


**9. With reference to Kuchipudi and Mohiniyattam dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1. Kuchipudi, originating in Andhra Pradesh, was traditionally performed only by men but has evolved to include women dancers.
2. Mohiniyattam, the classical solo dance form of Kerala, is conventionally performed solely by female artists, with no exceptions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kuchipudi's origins and its evolution to include women performers are accurately described. This reflects knowledge of the dance form's historical context and its contemporary practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mohiniyattam is predominantly performed by women, the statement's assertion of *no exceptions* is false.  Recent developments have seen some efforts to challenge traditional gender roles in the performance of this dance form.  The absolute nature of the statement makes it a strong distractor. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view.


**1. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1. He was born in a Brahmin family in Murbad, Thane district, Maharashtra, and significantly contributed to the architectural planning of Mumbai's buildings, streets, and avenues.
2.  A staunch advocate for women's education, he donated family land to establish schools and played a key role in the development of the first railway line in India connecting Boribunder and Thane.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's birthplace and his crucial role in shaping Mumbai's urban landscape are well-documented. He was instrumental in planning and developing the city's infrastructure, contributing significantly to its architectural design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shankarseth was a strong proponent of women's education and donated land for schools, his direct involvement in the development of the first railway line in India is not historically supported.  Although he was a member of a committee that gave impetus to the railway project, attributing a *key* role to him in its development would be an overstatement.  The impetus for the railway project came from broader economic and political factors.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Swami Dayanand Saraswati:**

1.  His original name was Mula Shankara, and he authored "Satyartha Prakash" in Sanskrit, advocating a return to Vedic principles and denouncing idolatry.
2.  He initiated his studies under Swami Virajananda Saraswati at Mathura, focusing on Panini and Patanjali's works, and later established the Ramakrishna Mission to promote Vedic ideology.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While his original name was indeed Mula Shankara and he did author "Satyartha Prakash,"  it was written in Hindi, not Sanskrit.  The text strongly advocated a return to Vedic principles and criticized idolatry.

Statement 2 is correct.  His studies under Swami Virajananda Saraswati in Mathura, focusing on the works of Panini and Patanjali, are historically accurate. However, he did *not* establish the Ramakrishna Mission. The Ramakrishna Mission was founded by Swami Vivekananda.  This represents a significant historical inaccuracy often used as a distractor.


**3. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. She became the Queen of Malwa in 1767, following the death of her husband and father-in-law, and significantly contributed to the development of the Maheswari weaving industry.
2.  A renowned patron of arts and literature, she commissioned the reconstruction of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Somnath Temple, and also supported the works of the Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ahilyabai Holkar's ascension to the throne of Malwa after the deaths of her husband and father-in-law is a well-established historical fact. Her patronage of the Maheswari weaving industry, which contributed significantly to the region's economy, is also accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Her patronage of arts and literature is well-documented. She played a major role in the reconstruction of the Kashi Vishwanath and Somnath Temples, and she was a patron of the Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram and other artists.


**4. With reference to Ratan Naval Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Under his leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased dramatically, and he launched the Tata Nano, a pioneering affordable car, while also receiving the Padma Vibhushan in 2010.
2.  Tata Motors received the PETA India award for its commitment to using vegan interiors in its AVINYA Concept car, and Ratan Tata was recognized with the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year – Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Tata Group's revenue growth under Ratan Tata's leadership and the launch of the Tata Nano are accurate, the year he received the Padma Vibhushan is incorrect; he received it in 2008, not 2010.  The slight inaccuracy in the date is a common distractor technique.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PETA India award for Tata Motors' use of vegan interiors and the Ernst & Young Lifetime Achievement Award are accurate. The year of the Ernst & Young award is also correct, unlike the Padma Vibhushan date in statement 1.


**5. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established by the then-President Dr. Rajendra Prasad in 1954, the award is open to both Indian and non-Indian citizens, with a maximum of three awards being given annually.
2.  Recipients are prohibited from using "Bharat Ratna" as a title, but they are permitted to mention their receipt of the award in their official biographical information.  The award includes a significant monetary grant.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The establishment date and the eligibility criteria (including both Indian and non-Indian citizens) are accurate. The maximum number of awards is generally three, although there have been exceptions.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The restriction on using "Bharat Ratna" as a title is correct, and mentioning the award in official biographies is also allowed. However, the statement that the award includes a significant monetary grant is false; the Bharat Ratna does *not* come with any monetary component.  This is a key detail often overlooked.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics-related themes where possible, and adhering to all specified formatting and content criteria.  Note that extracting purely economic questions from the provided text is challenging, so some questions will indirectly relate to economic concepts or impacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Republic Day, they recognize exceptional and distinguished service across various disciplines, not limited to the arts.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Padma Vibhushan is the highest honor among the three Padma Awards; the Padma Shri is the lowest.  The statement reverses the order of prestige.  This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the award hierarchy.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern subtle inaccuracies in descriptions.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Anubhav Awards:**

1.  The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Finance, recognizing outstanding contributions to public sector financial management.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Finance.  This highlights the importance of knowing the correct awarding body. The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to distinguish between similar government departments.

Statement 2 is correct. The awards are indeed based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees/pensioners via the Anubhav Portal. This accurately reflects the selection criteria for the award.  This tests recall of specific details about the award process.


**3. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashoka Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, taking precedence over the Param Vir Chakra.
2.  These awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, ranking above the Ashoka Chakra, which is the highest peacetime gallantry award.  The statement incorrectly reverses the order of precedence. The question tests detailed knowledge of the award system and hierarchy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gallantry awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day. The statement incorrectly limits the announcement frequency. This tests factual recall and understanding of the award announcement schedule.


**4. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and initially called the "President's Awards."
2.  Awards are given only in the category of Feature Films.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although established in 1954, the National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards," not "President's Awards."  This seemingly minor detail demonstrates a need for precise factual knowledge. The question highlights the importance of accurate terminology and historical context.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The awards are presented across three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema. The statement incorrectly limits the award categories. This tests factual knowledge and understanding of the award's scope.



**5. With reference to UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles Award is a monetary grant bestowed upon architectural projects demonstrating exceptional sustainability.
2. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru was among the recipients of the UNESCO’s 2023 Prix Versailles Award.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award does not offer a monetary grant; it is purely an award for recognition. The statement incorrectly describes the nature of the award. The question tests understanding of the award's characteristics and its lack of financial incentive.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru did indeed receive the 2023 award. This tests current event knowledge related to architectural recognition.


**6. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded posthumously only in exceptional cases.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna are prohibited from using the title in any official capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While initially not conferred posthumously, the Bharat Ratna can now be awarded posthumously in exceptional cases. The statement accurately reflects the current practice. The question tests knowledge of the award's evolution and current rules.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits using 'Bharat Ratna' as a title. However,  the phrasing is slightly misleading;  recipients *are* allowed to mention the award in their biographies or on letterheads, etc., just not as a formal title preceding their name.  The nuance in the wording makes this a challenging question, testing the ability to interpret legal and social conventions.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was instituted in 1969 to commemorate the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, who is considered the father of Indian cinema.
2. The award includes a cash prize of ₹20 lakhs and a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. This accurately states the reason and year of the award's establishment.  The question tests knowledge of Indian cinema history and the origin of awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the award does include a Golden Lotus medallion, the cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  The question uses a slightly inaccurate figure to create a plausible distractor, testing precise factual recall.


**8. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, born in 1720, became the ruler of Malwa after the death of her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar.
2.  She is primarily known for her patronage of arts and reconstruction of the Somnath Temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was born in 1725, not 1720.  The question uses an incorrect birth year as a distractor, testing precise factual recall about historical figures.

Statement 2 is correct. Her patronage of arts and her reconstruction of several significant temples, including Somnath, are well-documented aspects of her reign. The question focuses on key contributions of a historical figure.


**9. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary is celebrated as National Teachers' Day.
2.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which focuses primarily on religious education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary is celebrated as National Youth Day, not National Teachers' Day. The question tests knowledge of national observances and their association with historical figures.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While he did establish the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, its activities extend far beyond religious education; it is involved in extensive social service, including running hospitals and schools. The question tests knowledge of an organization's functions and scope.  The partially correct nature of the statement makes it a more challenging distractor.


**10. With reference to the Kashi Culture Pathway, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Culture Pathway is a project primarily focused on promoting tourism in Varanasi by improving infrastructure.
2. The Outcome Document of the G20 Culture Working Group endorsed a global coalition to combat illicit trafficking, indirectly related to the Kashi Culture Pathway's goals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the Kashi Culture Pathway does aim to promote tourism in Varanasi, it goes beyond mere infrastructure improvements; it focuses on preserving and showcasing the city's rich cultural heritage.  The question tests understanding of the project's scope and goals.

Statement 2 is correct. The Outcome Document did endorse a global coalition against illicit trafficking, with a connection to the protection of cultural heritage, which is relevant to the Kashi Culture Pathway's goals. The question tests the ability to link seemingly unrelated events and understand broader policy implications.  The indirect connection makes this a challenging question.


**1. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standardized weights and measures used in the Indus Valley Civilization indicate a high degree of centralized economic control, possibly overseen by a powerful priestly class.
2.  Evidence suggests that the Indus Valley Civilization primarily exported precious stones and imported grains and pottery from Mesopotamia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The remarkable uniformity of weights and measures across the vast geographical expanse of the Indus Valley Civilization points towards a sophisticated system of standardization, implying centralized planning and control over economic activities. This suggests the presence of a strong central authority, possibly a priestly class, capable of implementing and enforcing such a system. While the exact nature and extent of this control are still debated, the evidence strongly suggests a high degree of economic organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Archaeological evidence indicates the opposite. The Indus Valley Civilization exported goods like grain, jewelry, and pottery.  Imports included materials like copper and precious stones, primarily from regions like Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). The direction of trade was not as stated in the second statement. The statement reverses the direction of trade in the Indus Valley Civilization.


**2. With reference to the Chola Dynasty's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chola navy's victory at Kandalursalai decisively established Chola dominance over the entire Indian Ocean.
2.  Rajaraja Chola's naval campaigns extended to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, but not as far as the Malay Peninsula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chola victory at Kandalursalai was significant, it did not immediately result in complete Chola dominance over the entire Indian Ocean.  The Indian Ocean remained a contested space with other powers, and Chola dominance was gradually established over time through sustained naval activity and strategic alliances. The statement overstates the immediate and complete effect of the Chola victory.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Rajaraja Chola's naval campaigns extended beyond Sri Lanka and the Maldives. His successor, Rajendra Chola I, further expanded Chola naval power, conducting significant expeditions into Southeast Asia, conquering parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The statement underestimates the geographical reach of the Chola naval campaigns.


**3. With reference to the practice of Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is primarily practiced by nomadic tribes in the Himalayan region, with minimal presence in the plains of India.
2.  The animals involved in transhumance in India are exclusively sheep and goats, reflecting the limitations of the available grazing lands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas among tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it is also practiced in the plains of various states including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly limits the geographical distribution of transhumance in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While sheep and goats are common livestock in transhumance, other animals like cattle are also involved depending on the region and the needs of the pastoral communities. The statement incorrectly restricts the types of animals involved in transhumance.


**4. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a genetically modified variety of cotton, engineered for higher yield and pest resistance.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kasturi Cotton is not a genetically modified variety. It is premium quality Indian cotton distinguished by its 100% traceability and certification, leveraging blockchain technology. It focuses on quality and traceability, not genetic modification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL plays a significant role, the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry. It's not solely implemented by one agency.  The statement incorrectly attributes sole implementation to a single entity.


**5. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI aims to promote contemporary Indian art forms exclusively, excluding traditional or folk art forms.
2.  Lalit Kala Akademi is the sole implementing agency for Project PARI, with no involvement from other organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI's scope includes both contemporary and traditional Indian art forms. The project explicitly mentions the inclusion of various traditional art forms like Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, Bani Thani Painting, and Alpana art. The statement wrongly excludes traditional art forms.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Lalit Kala Akademi is a key implementing agency, Project PARI is a collaborative effort also involving the National Gallery of Modern Art. The statement incorrectly claims sole implementation by one agency.


**6. With reference to the  National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC at Lothal is being developed solely by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways without any private sector involvement.
2.  The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides evidence of advanced shipbuilding technology and maritime trade during the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, indicating collaboration between the government and private entities. The statement incorrectly claims sole government development.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of the dry dock at Lothal is significant evidence of the Indus Valley Civilization's advanced maritime capabilities, including shipbuilding, understanding of tides and winds, and extensive maritime trade. The statement correctly highlights the significance of the archaeological discovery.


**7. With reference to the  Archaeological Survey of India's (ASI) delisting of monuments, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based solely on the assessment of their physical condition, irrespective of their historical or cultural significance.
2.  The delisting of monuments under the AMASR Act, 1958, automatically transfers ownership of those monuments to the state governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ASI's decision to delist monuments takes into account both the physical condition and the historical/cultural significance.  The assessment considers whether the monument retains its national importance.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the criteria for delisting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Delisting under the AMASR Act, 1958, does not automatically transfer ownership. It simply removes the monument from ASI's protection and maintenance responsibilities. Ownership remains with the original owner or as specified by law. The statement incorrectly describes the consequences of delisting.


**8. With reference to the  Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty actively resisted the introduction of Western education and cultural practices, preferring to maintain traditional Maratha customs.
2.  Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War led to the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly altering the Holkar's relationship with the British East India Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Holkar Dynasty, particularly under Ahilyabai Holkar, actively promoted social reforms including women's education and widow remarriage.  They also encouraged trade and commerce. The statement presents a false narrative about the dynasty's social policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in the Treaty of Mandsaur, which significantly altered the power dynamics and relationship between the Holkars and the British East India Company. The statement accurately reflects the historical outcome of the war.


**9. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's philanthropic activities were primarily focused on establishing educational institutions for boys, reflecting the societal norms of his time.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While he did support boys' education, Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's philanthropy extended to girls' education as well, demonstrating a progressive approach for his time.  The statement underrepresents the scope of his philanthropic contributions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth made significant contributions to Mumbai's urban development, influencing its building plans, streets, and avenues.  The statement accurately reflects his contribution to Mumbai's infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Oeko-Tex certification ensures that textiles are tested for harmful substances and produced under environmentally friendly conditions. It doesn't necessarily mean that only organic methods are used.  The statement overstates the scope of the certification.

Statement 2 is correct. The Oeko-Tex certification for Eri silk was obtained by the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation, a government agency. This highlights the government's focus on sustainable practices in the silk industry. The statement correctly identifies the recipient of the certification.



**1. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton produced exclusively in the state of Gujarat, leveraging blockchain technology for complete traceability.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, aiming to enhance global competitiveness and create a sustainable ecosystem for Indian cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kasturi Cotton is indeed a premium quality Indian cotton utilizing blockchain technology for traceability and certification,  it's not exclusively produced in Gujarat. The initiative empowers ginners across India to produce it.  The statement misrepresents the geographical scope of Kasturi Cotton production.

Statement 2 is correct. TEXPROCIL is accurately identified as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative. The initiative's goals of enhancing global competitiveness and fostering a sustainable ecosystem for Indian cotton are also correctly stated.  This statement accurately reflects the facts of the initiative's structure and objectives.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to Project PARI, consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, aims to promote the commercialization of art through public installations in rural landscapes.
2.  Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are executing Project PARI, showcasing diverse Indian art forms like Thangka painting and Cheriyal painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI's aim is to *democratize* art, making it accessible to the public, not to commercialize it. The project focuses on public installations in *urban* landscapes, not rural ones. The statement incorrectly describes both the aim and the location of the art installations.

Statement 2 is correct.  Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are the executing agencies for Project PARI. The inclusion of diverse Indian art forms such as Thangka and Cheriyal painting is also accurately mentioned. The statement accurately reflects the project's implementation and artistic scope.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Tourism launched the "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative across 100 tourist destinations in India to promote sustainable tourism practices.
2. The initiative primarily focuses on training local women as guides to enhance the tourism experience and empower local communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initiative was launched across 50, not 100, tourist destinations. The statement incorrectly states the number of destinations covered by the initiative.  While the initiative promotes responsible tourism,  the focus isn't explicitly stated as *sustainable* tourism practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the initiative likely involves local community engagement, the primary focus isn't exclusively on training women as guides.  The statement makes an assumption about the specific nature of the community engagement without sufficient evidence. Both statements contain inaccuracies. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval conquests extended to the Maldives and parts of Southeast Asia, including the Sailendra Empire.
2. Rajendra Chola I's significant naval victory at Kandalursalai resulted in the complete annexation of Sri Lanka as a Chola province.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions did indeed reach the Maldives and parts of Southeast Asia, including campaigns against the Sailendra Empire.  This accurately reflects the extent of his naval power and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra Chola I did conquer parts of Sri Lanka, it wasn't a complete annexation resulting from the battle of Kandalursalai.  The battle of Kandalursalai was a victory against the Chera navy, not a decisive battle leading to the complete control of Sri Lanka. Rajaraja I's conquests were more significant in Sri Lanka's annexation.  The statement misattributes the conquest and the location of the significant naval victory. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**5. With reference to Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region by nomadic tribes like Gujars and Bakarwals, involving the seasonal movement of cattle between high-altitude pastures and plains.
2. The practice of transhumance is limited to the Himalayan region and does not exist in the plains of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description accurately portrays transhumance in the Himalayas, involving the seasonal migration of nomadic tribes with their livestock between high-altitude pastures and lower plains. The statement correctly identifies the geographical location and the participating communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Transhumance is not limited to the Himalayas; it also exists in the plains of several Indian states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly restricts the geographical scope of the practice. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**6. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

2. The MOW program, launched in 1992, maintains only an International Register, excluding regional or national registers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are accurately identified as Indian literary works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The statement accurately reflects the inclusion of these works and their significance.

2. The Oeko-Tex certification obtained by the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation ensures that Eri silk production adheres to environmentally friendly practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori*.  It is primarily cultivated in Northeast India, not the southern states.  The statement incorrectly identifies both the silkworm species and the primary cultivation region.

Statement 2 is correct. The Oeko-Tex certification obtained by the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation for Eri silk accurately reflects the environmentally friendly practices in its production. The statement accurately reflects the certification and its implication for sustainable production. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

1.  Denisovans, an extinct hominin species, were geographically confined to Siberia and did not have any presence in Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Denisovans' range extended from Siberia to Southeast Asia during the last Ice Age. The statement incorrectly limits their geographical distribution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kashi Culture Pathway promotes Indian heritage, its scope extends beyond solely promoting Indian culture globally. It also aims to address illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts, a global issue. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, explicitly prevents the *export* of antiquities outside India, not primarily focusing on domestic trade.  The statement misrepresents the Act's primary focus.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**11. With reference to International Yoga Day, consider the following statements:**

1.  International Yoga Day, celebrated annually on June 21st, was proposed by India and adopted by the United Nations in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The LEC did initially include the "original literary tradition" criterion, which was later dropped in revisions. This accurately reflects the evolution of the criteria for classical language designation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Prakrit languages were spoken by the masses, not the elite, who primarily used Sanskrit. The statement incorrectly describes the social class associated with Prakrit languages.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign was marked by significant territorial expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab and military successes against the Sultan of Bijapur and the rulers of Orissa.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ahom administration, while a monarchy, wasn't highly centralized; power was significantly vested in the Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris). The king's power was not absolute. The statement incorrectly describes the nature of the administrative system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ahom rulers did adopt Shaivism and the Shakti movement, leading to the construction and patronage of numerous temples, including the Kamakhya Devi Temple. The statement accurately reflects their religious practices and architectural patronage. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Megalithic culture is primarily associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, not the Bronze Age, and is characterized by large stone structures used for burial. The statement incorrectly identifies the time period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hire Benkal Megalithic site is under *consideration* for inclusion in UNESCO's tentative list, it is not yet a designated World Heritage site. The statement incorrectly states its status. Therefore, neither statement is correct.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument solely on its "untraceability," as defined under the AMASR Act, 1958.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" and provides a clear procedure for their delisting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the untraceability of a monument is a significant factor considered by the ASI, the decision to delist also involves an assessment of its national importance. The ASI considers various factors beyond mere untraceability, including historical significance, architectural merit, and overall condition, before recommending delisting to the Ministry of Culture. The final decision rests with the Central Government based on the assessment of national importance, as per Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.  The criteria for delisting are not solely based on "untraceability."

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined in the AMASR Act, 1958. This term emerged from usage by the CAG Audit team in their reports.  The Act itself focuses on the delisting of monuments that have ceased to be of national importance, irrespective of whether they are "missing" or "untraceable." The process involves an assessment of the monument's significance and a decision by the Central Government based on that assessment.  The Act doesn't prescribe a specific definition for "missing monuments" nor a unique procedure for their handling.


**2. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Padma Awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional circumstances, and the decision rests solely with the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Padma Awards are normally not conferred posthumously, there is a provision for exceptional cases where the government might consider awarding posthumously. The final decision rests with the government, not solely with the President, though the President formally confers the awards.  The statement accurately reflects the general practice, highlighting the exceptional nature of posthumous awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution explicitly prohibits the use of titles conferred by the government, including Padma Awards, as prefixes or suffixes to names.  While recipients can mention the award in their biodata or other official documents, they cannot use it as a title preceding or following their name.  The statement contradicts the constitutional provision.


**3. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented annually to retiring central government employees who have made significant contributions to administrative reforms during their service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are not presented annually to all retiring central government employees.  They are given based on the quality of the Anubhav write-ups submitted by retiring employees, which detail their experiences and insights. The awards aim to encourage knowledge sharing and administrative reforms but are not a universal recognition of all retiring employees' contributions.  The statement misrepresents the frequency and criteria for award selection.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Anubhav Awards are explicitly based on the quality and impact of the Anubhav write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees and pensioners. These write-ups on the Anubhav Portal represent their professional experiences and insights. The selection process focuses solely on the content and value of these submissions.  The statement accurately describes the core selection criterion.


**4. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashoka Chakra was initially instituted as three classes (Class I, Class II, and Class III) in 1952 and renamed in 1967 to Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra and Vir Chakra respectively.
2. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1950 and are awarded only during wartime.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in three classes in 1952, but it was later renamed in 1967 to Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra respectively, not to Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra.  The statement incorrectly conflates the Ashoka Chakra with the wartime gallantry awards.

Statement 2 is correct. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were indeed instituted in 1950 and are specifically awarded for acts of gallantry during wartime. These awards represent the highest honors for bravery in the face of the enemy. The statement accurately reflects the purpose and timing of these prestigious awards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and were initially called "State Awards," but the Directorate of Film Festivals did not administer the awards from the very beginning.  The Directorate of Film Festivals took over the administration of the awards in 1973. The statement contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the administrative body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Film Awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema.  The statement omits a key category of awards, providing an incomplete picture of the award structure.


**6.  With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles Award is given annually by the UNESCO to projects that demonstrate innovation and ecological efficiency, but excludes projects that focus solely on social interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award specifically highlights projects that promote social interaction and participation, in addition to innovation and ecological efficiency. The award criteria explicitly include social impact as a key factor in project selection. The statement incorrectly excludes a crucial aspect of the award's focus.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award indeed considers projects’ ecological, social, and cultural impacts, aligning with the principles of intelligent sustainability.  The evaluation process considers the holistic impact of the project, reflecting a commitment to sustainable development. The statement accurately reflects the award's selection criteria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna Award was established in 1954 by the then President Dr. Rajendra Prasad, not Jawaharlal Nehru. Also, it was not initially restricted only to Indians;  it has been awarded to non-Indians as well, such as Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela. The statement contains inaccuracies regarding both the founder and the eligibility criteria.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a maximum of three Bharat Ratna awards are typically given each year, there have been other exceptions beyond 1999 and 2024 where more than three awards were presented. The statement provides an incomplete and inaccurate account of the exceptions to the usual award limit.


**8. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a non-violent protest against caste-based restrictions on temple entry, concluded in 1924 with the complete opening of all roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva temple to all castes.
2.  The movement witnessed significant support from various religious communities, including Christians and Muslims, and figures like Sree Narayana Guru and E.V. Ramasamy Naicker played key roles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha, while achieving partial success in opening three out of four roads leading to the temple, did not result in the complete opening of all roads to all castes in 1924. The complete opening of all roads came only later, with the Temple Entry Proclamation in 1936. The statement misrepresents the extent of the immediate success of the Satyagraha.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha did receive considerable support from various religious communities, including Christians and Muslims, reflecting a broader movement against caste-based discrimination.  Prominent figures like Sree Narayana Guru and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker played crucial roles in mobilizing support and leading the movement. The statement accurately highlights the diverse support and key figures associated with the Satyagraha.


**9. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action, led by Ram Prasad Bismil, primarily aimed at seizing funds from the British Indian Government treasury to finance educational institutions for the underprivileged.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kakori Train Action did involve the seizure of funds from the British Indian Government treasury, the primary aim was not to finance educational institutions. The funds were intended to support revolutionary activities against British rule. The statement misrepresents the intended use of the funds acquired.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kakori Conspiracy Case did result in death sentences for several key figures, including Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh.  These executions represented a significant event in the Indian independence movement. The statement accurately reflects the outcome of the trial.


**10. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion was primarily triggered not by industrialization policies but by the exploitation and oppression of the Santhal people by British colonial authorities and moneylenders.  The loss of land and resources, coupled with unjust taxation and legal systems, were the main causes of the rebellion. The statement provides an inaccurate explanation of the rebellion's root causes.

Statement 2 is correct. Karl Marx did indeed refer to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution in his writings. This assessment highlights the significance of the rebellion within the broader context of Indian history and resistance against colonial rule.  The statement accurately reflects Marx's perspective.


**11. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," was primarily caused by a prolonged drought that devastated agricultural production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," was indeed primarily caused by a prolonged drought that severely impacted agricultural production. This led to widespread crop failure and a devastating famine. The statement accurately identifies the main cause of the famine.

Statement 2 is correct.  Following the famine, Thomas Edward Ravenshaw did establish numerous vernacular schools in rural areas with an emphasis on the Odia language. This was part of his efforts to address the social and economic consequences of the disaster. The statement accurately reflects a key post-famine initiative.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Saragarhi involved a small force of 21 Sikh soldiers from the British Indian Army against a much larger force of Afridi and Orakzai tribals, not the Afghan army.  The statement misrepresents the scale and participants of the battle.

Statement 2 is correct. All 21 Sikh soldiers who fought bravely and died in the Battle of Saragarhi were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, the highest British gallantry award given to Indian troops at that time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Apartheid system was formally institutionalized in 1948, its origins lie in earlier discriminatory laws and practices dating back to the British colonial era.  These earlier measures laid the groundwork for the later, more systematic, and brutal system of racial segregation. The statement accurately reflects the historical context of Apartheid.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) was a significant transnational social movement, involving substantial international support and pressure on the South African government.  International sanctions and boycotts played a crucial role in dismantling the Apartheid regime. The statement misrepresents the international dimension of the AAM.


**14. With reference to Nelson Mandela, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  Nelson Mandela was indeed born in 1918 in the Eastern Cape of South Africa; however, his father was a Thembu chief, not a prominent member of the African National Congress (ANC). Mandela himself joined the ANC later in his life. The statement contains a factual inaccuracy regarding his father's affiliation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and the Bharat Ratna, he did receive the International Gandhi Peace Prize in 2001.  The statement incorrectly omits a significant award received by Mandela.

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Independence Day.
2.  The awards are given in four categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Padma Ratna.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Padma Awards, one of India's highest civilian honors, were instituted in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  They recognize exceptional and distinguished service in various fields.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Padma Awards are conferred in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri. There is no "Padma Ratna" category.  The inclusion of a fictitious category serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the award scheme.  The slight alteration in the number of categories and the introduction of an incorrect category make this a difficult question requiring precise recall.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. This subtle difference tests the candidate's detailed understanding of government departments and their functions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The awards are indeed based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees/pensioners through write-ups on the Anubhav Portal. The aim is to improve governance based on the accumulated wisdom of experienced officials.  This makes the question challenging because it tests the knowledge of a less widely known award scheme and its specific administering body.


**3. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is awarded only during wartime, while the Ashoka Chakra can be awarded both in wartime and peacetime.
2. The Kirti Chakra was instituted in 1952 as Class-II of the Ashoka Chakra and renamed in 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration, is awarded for conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy, whether on land, at sea, or in the air. The Ashoka Chakra, the highest peacetime gallantry award, can be awarded for valour, courageous action, or self-sacrifice in peacetime.  The distinction between wartime and peacetime awards is crucial.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Kirti Chakra was initially instituted in 1952 as Class-II of the Ashoka Chakra. It was later renamed Kirti Chakra in 1967.  This demonstrates a need for precise knowledge of the chronology and evolution of these awards.  The question tests the candidates' awareness of the historical context surrounding the evolution of gallantry awards.


**4. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and were initially called "National Awards".
2.  The awards are currently administered by the Central Board of Film Certification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and were initially called "State Awards," not "National Awards." The renaming to "National Film Awards" happened later.  This requires specific knowledge of the award's history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Film Awards are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The CBFC is responsible for film censorship, while the Directorate of Film Festivals manages the awards.  This highlights the need for differentiation between regulatory bodies within the film industry.  The question tests the understanding of the administrative structure related to Indian cinema.



**5. With reference to UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The award was established in 2010 and is given biennially.
2.  The award considers projects' ecological, social, and cultural impacts, aligning with the principles of intelligent sustainability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNESCO Prix Versailles Award was established in 2015, not 2010, and is granted annually, not biennially.  The incorrect dates and frequency act as effective distractors.

Statement 2 is correct. The award criteria explicitly emphasize the ecological, social, and cultural impacts of the projects, reflecting the principles of intelligent sustainability. This aspect of the award is crucial to understanding its broader significance.  The question tests knowledge of the award's principles and criteria.


**6. With reference to the delisting of monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASI’s decision to delist monuments is based on reports from the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2.  Once delisted, a monument loses its protection under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, allowing for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based on reports from the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the relevant government ministries and their roles.

Statement 2 is correct.  Delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, removes the monument's protection under the ASI, opening the way for construction and urban development in the area.  This highlights the legal implications of delisting.  The question tests the understanding of the legal framework governing the protection of historical monuments.



**7. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ancient Nalanda University was founded by Chandragupta Maurya in the 4th century BCE.
2.  The modern Nalanda University campus is a "Net Zero Green Campus".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, not by Chandragupta Maurya in the 4th century BCE. The incorrect founder and period are designed to mislead candidates.

Statement 2 is correct.  The new Nalanda University campus is indeed designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus," reflecting modern sustainable design principles.  The question tests knowledge of both the historical and contemporary aspects of Nalanda University.  The contrast between historical and modern contexts makes this a challenging question.


**8. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton from India with 100% traceability and certification using Artificial Intelligence technology.
2. The Cotton Corporation of India is the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kasturi Cotton is indeed a premium quality cotton with 100% traceability and certification, it uses blockchain technology, not Artificial Intelligence, for traceability.  The substitution of a related but incorrect technology acts as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), not the Cotton Corporation of India.  This requires precise knowledge of the involved organizations.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific agencies involved in the initiative.


**9. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Tourism.
2.  The project aims to promote the democratization of art through public installations in rural landscapes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, not a joint initiative with the Ministry of Tourism.  The incorrect inclusion of another ministry serves as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Project PARI aims to democratize art through public installations in *urban*, not rural, landscapes.  The substitution of location is designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the project's scope.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the project's location and objectives.


**10. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded for outstanding service in the fields of arts, literature, science, and sports only.
2.  The award comes with a monetary grant and a certificate signed by the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is awarded for exceptional service in *any* field, not limited to arts, literature, science, and sports.  The restrictive nature of the statement creates a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does *not* come with a monetary grant; it only includes a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President.  The inclusion of a monetary component and the incorrect signatory are designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the award.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the award's specifics.


**1. With reference to megalithic burial practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic chamber tomb, are characterized by their entirely subterranean construction.
2.  Megalithic sites exclusively feature burial structures; non-burial megaliths are absent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  The text explicitly states they are "semi-subterranean chamber tombs." This detail is crucial for differentiating them from other types of burial structures.  A misunderstanding of this key characteristic would lead to an incorrect answer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text clearly mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths *not* connected with burials. This demonstrates that not all megaliths are associated with burial practices, contradicting the statement. The inclusion of this third category is a significant detail that highlights the diversity of megalithic structures and challenges the simplistic assumption that all such sites are solely for burials.


**2. With reference to the Ikshvaku period in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A significant coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period was discovered at the Bavikonda monastery near Visakhapatnam.
2. Archaeological excavations at Phanigiri in Telangana have unearthed evidence suggesting the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects during the Ikshvaku period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifically mentions the discovery of a coin hoard at the Phanigiri site in Telangana, not at the Bavikonda monastery.  This highlights the importance of precise location details in archaeological findings and the need for careful reading of the provided information.  Confusing the locations of these two significant sites would lead to an incorrect selection.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of Phanigiri explicitly states that the "thorana’s panel shows that both Mahayana and Hinayana sects co-existed here." This provides direct evidence supporting the coexistence of these Buddhist sects during the Ikshvaku period.  The mention of the thorana panel as a source of this information reinforces the factual basis of the statement.


**3. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, a prominent IVC city, is situated near the confluence of the Narmada and Tapti rivers.
2.  The IVC is known for its extensive use of iron tools and weaponry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that Lothal is located "between Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near Gulf of Khambat," not near the Narmada and Tapti rivers.  This subtle but crucial difference in geographical location demonstrates the importance of precise knowledge of IVC sites and their riverine contexts.  Incorrectly associating Lothal with the wrong river system would lead to an incorrect answer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that "Iron was not known to the people" of the IVC. This is a fundamental characteristic of the civilization's technological stage, distinguishing it from later periods characterized by iron metallurgy.  The absence of iron technology is a key aspect of understanding the IVC's material culture and technological advancements.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but not Sri Lanka.
2.  The Chola navy's defeat at Kandalursalai significantly hampered their maritime dominance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Rajendra I "launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire...leading to the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra," *and* that his "naval conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province."  The statement incorrectly omits Sri Lanka from his conquests.  This demonstrates the need for accurate recall of the geographical extent of Chola naval power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions Rajaraja's destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai,  presenting this as a *victory* for the Cholas, not a defeat.  The statement reverses the outcome of this naval engagement, highlighting the potential for misinterpreting historical accounts if details are not carefully considered.


**5. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bavikonda Monastery is located near Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh and is known for its Mahayana Buddhist architecture.
2.  The name "Bavikonda" translates to "hill of stupas," reflecting the numerous stupas found at the site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bavikonda is indeed in Andhra Pradesh, the text places it near Visakhapatnam, not Amaravati.  Furthermore, the monastery is described as having a *Theravada* (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, not Mahayana.  This demonstrates the importance of accurately recalling the geographical location and the specific school of Buddhism associated with the site.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explains that "Bavikonda’ means a hill of wells," referring to the historical presence of water storage structures, not stupas.  The incorrect translation of the name highlights the necessity of precise understanding of place names and their etymological significance.


**6. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings ruled with absolute power, unconstrained by any advisory councils.
2.  The Ahom Dynasty's cultural influence extended to the construction and patronage of numerous Hindu temples, including the Kamakhya Devi temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that "Power heavily vested in the Council of Ministry despite being a monarchy," indicating that Ahom kings did *not* rule with absolute power but were subject to the advice and influence of a council of ministers.  This contradicts the statement's assertion of absolute power.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that the Ahoms "Adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement and built temples across Assam including the Kamakhya Devi temple." This clearly illustrates their cultural patronage of Hindu temple architecture and religious practices.


**7.  With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty ruled the Vijayanagara Empire during its period of greatest territorial expansion and military success.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas were appointed solely based on merit and were not granted hereditary rights to their territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Sangama Dynasty, oversaw the empire's zenith.  While the Sangama Dynasty founded the empire, it was under the Tuluvas that it reached its greatest extent and military power.  This highlights the need for an accurate understanding of the chronological succession of dynasties and their respective contributions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that the Amara-Nayakas' positions "became hereditary" once allotted. This contradicts the statement's claim that they were not granted hereditary rights.  The hereditary nature of the Amara-Nayaka system is a key aspect of understanding the empire's political structure and power dynamics.


**8. With reference to prehistoric rock art in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest rock paintings in India date back to the Mesolithic period and predominantly depict hunting scenes.
2.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic rock art is characterized by a vibrant and detailed style, showcasing a high level of artistic skill.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that the earliest paintings are from the Upper Paleolithic period, not the Mesolithic. While hunting scenes are common in Mesolithic art, attributing the earliest examples to that period is inaccurate. This exemplifies the need for precise knowledge of the chronological sequence of art styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text describes Neolithic-Chalcolithic art as having lost the "vividness and vitality" of earlier periods.  The statement incorrectly portrays this period's art as highly detailed and skillfully executed when the provided information suggests a decline in artistic vibrancy.  This highlights the importance of understanding stylistic changes across different prehistoric periods.


**9. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, led by Emperor Ashoka, resulted in the complete annihilation of the Kalinga Dynasty.
2. Kharavela, a significant ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is renowned for his patronage of Jainism and his military campaigns documented in the Hathigumpha inscription.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War was a significant event leading to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, it did not lead to the complete destruction of the Kalinga Dynasty. The dynasty continued to exist for some time after the war. This demonstrates the importance of nuanced understanding of historical events and their consequences.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and the importance of the Hathigumpha inscription in documenting his reign and military achievements.  This shows the importance of key figures and their contributions to understanding a historical period.


**10. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut), consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode's historical significance is primarily linked to its role as a major center for the trade of cotton textiles in the medieval period.
2.  The Samoothiris (Zamorins) were the rulers of Kozhikode during the medieval age, and the city's recognition as a UNESCO City of Literature is a recent event.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Kozhikode did trade textiles, its primary historical significance is more strongly linked to its role as a major spice trading center ("City of Spices"), trading in black pepper and cardamom.  The emphasis on cotton textiles misrepresents the core of its medieval economic importance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text confirms that the Samoothiris ruled Kozhikode during the medieval age and mentions the city's recent recognition as a UNESCO City of Literature.  This shows the importance of understanding both the historical rulers and modern cultural designations of a place.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's prior knowledge.  I have aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra, symbolizing fearlessness, is exclusively associated with the depiction of the Buddha taming a mad elephant.
2.  Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Dhyani Buddha, is depicted using the Bhumisparsha Mudra to represent the calling of the earth to witness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra is indeed a symbol of fearlessness and is sometimes depicted with the Buddha taming an elephant, this is not its *exclusive* association.  The mudra has broader symbolic meanings within Buddhist iconography.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Dhyani Buddha, is primarily associated with the Abhaya Mudra, representing fearlessness. The Bhumisparsha Mudra ("earth-touching mudra") is associated with Shakyamuni Buddha's overcoming of Mara during his enlightenment.  The statements confuse the mudras and their associated Buddhas.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of Buddhist iconography, demanding precise knowledge rather than general familiarity.


**2.  With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the US, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPA primarily aims to facilitate the swift return of Indian antiquities to India from the US, bypassing lengthy legal processes.
2.  The 1970 UNESCO Convention, Article 9, provides a comprehensive global framework that completely supersedes the need for bilateral agreements like the CPA for the repatriation of cultural property.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The CPA aims to streamline the process of seizing and repatriating Indian antiquities illicitly trafficked to the US. While legal processes are still involved, the agreement facilitates quicker action compared to relying solely on international conventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the 1970 UNESCO Convention is a significant international instrument, it doesn't completely supersede the need for bilateral agreements.  Bilateral agreements like the CPA offer a more specific and direct mechanism for cooperation between two nations regarding the repatriation of cultural property, addressing specific challenges and legal frameworks within each country. The question assesses the examinee's understanding of international law and cultural heritage protection, requiring knowledge of both international conventions and bilateral agreements.


**3. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval conquests were primarily focused on securing control over the eastern coast of India, leaving the western coast relatively untouched.
2.  Rajendra Chola I's expedition to the Sailendra Empire resulted in the complete annexation of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra under Chola rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja Chola I's naval power extended beyond the eastern coast of India. His conquests included Sri Lanka and expeditions to other regions of Southeast Asia.  The statement presents a limited and inaccurate view of the scope of Chola naval power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra Chola I's expedition to the Sailendra Empire did result in the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, it did not lead to the *complete* annexation of these territories under Chola rule.  The statement overstates the extent of Chola control in Southeast Asia.  The question tests the examinee's knowledge of the geographical extent of Chola power and the nuances of their conquests, demanding precise recall of historical details.


**4. With reference to transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is primarily a practice confined to the Himalayan region, with negligible presence in the plains of India.
2.  The Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes predominantly associated with rearing cattle and buffaloes as their primary livestock.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it also exists in various plains across India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement presents a geographically limited view of the practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the mentioned tribes do practice transhumance, their primary livestock is sheep and goats, not cattle and buffaloes.  The statement misrepresents the type of livestock these pastoral communities primarily raise.  The question tests the examinee's knowledge of the geographical distribution and the specifics of pastoral practices in India, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.


**5. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW program was launched in 1992 and maintains only a single, unified register encompassing all entries from across the globe.
2.  The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem in Awadhi, is among the Indian literary works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MOW program maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National.  The statement falsely simplifies the structure of the MOW program.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas, written in the 16th century (not 17th), is indeed among the Indian works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The question tests the examinee's understanding of the UNESCO's Memory of the World program and requires precise knowledge of the included literary works and their associated details. The slight inaccuracy in the date serves as a distractor.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. The award was instituted in 1969 to commemorate the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, widely regarded as the father of Indian cinema.
2. The award includes a cash prize of ₹20 lakhs, a Golden Lotus medallion, and a shawl.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was indeed instituted in 1969 to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The cash prize amount is ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  The other components of the award (Golden Lotus medallion and shawl) are correct. The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in details associated with a prestigious award.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangama dynasty, founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, was succeeded by the Tuluva dynasty, under whom the empire reached its zenith, followed by the Saluva dynasty.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas, military commanders granted territories to rule, were responsible solely for maintaining the empire's military strength and had no administrative responsibilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The chronological order of the Vijayanagara dynasties is Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu. The Tuluva dynasty did indeed see the empire reach its zenith, but the Saluva dynasty preceded it, not followed it. The statement incorrectly sequences the dynasties.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas had significant administrative responsibilities, including tax collection and the maintenance of local infrastructure (temples, irrigation). The statement understates their role. The question tests the examinee's understanding of the Vijayanagara Empire's political structure and the responsibilities of the Amara-Nayakas, requiring an accurate understanding of historical details and administrative structures.


**8. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is uniquely located at the confluence of seven rivers.
2.  There is only one Sangameshwar Temple in India, located in Nandyal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu, and is situated at the confluence of five, not seven, rivers.  The statement contains inaccuracies regarding the deity and the number of rivers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  There are multiple Sangameshwar Temples in India, located in different states. The statement makes an untrue claim about the uniqueness of the Nandyal temple's location. The question tests the examinee's knowledge of the geographical distribution and the characteristics of specific temples in India, demanding detailed and precise information.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha ascended to the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) after delivering his final sermon at Kushinagar.
2. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya is associated with a different significant event in the life of Lord Buddha, not directly related to IAD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Buddha's *descent* from Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not his ascent. The statement reverses the chronology of the event.

Statement 2 is correct. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya marks Buddha's descent from Tāvatimsa-devaloka, an event directly related to IAD, making the second statement correct.  The question tests knowledge of Buddhist chronology and the specific events associated with IAD, emphasizing the importance of accurate temporal sequencing.


**10. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1. The museum, built in memory of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake victims, features a Miyawaki forest, considered one of the smallest such forests globally.
2. The museum is located near Bhujio Fort, built by Roa Godji in 1723, on Bhujiyo Dungar hill.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja I's naval power was instrumental in not only securing the Coromandel Coast but also extended to significant victories against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka.  His influence extended beyond the immediate Bay of Bengal region, showcasing a broader maritime ambition than the statement suggests.  The statement minimizes the scope of his naval power and its impact.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's military campaigns represent a high point of Chola naval power. His expedition against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrating the reach and capability of the Chola navy to project power across the Indian Ocean.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it's also practiced in various plains regions across India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement incorrectly restricts the geographical scope of this practice.  The diversity of locations where transhumance is practiced is a key feature of its significance in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of transhumance traditions in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list underscores the importance of this practice not just as a method of livestock management but also as a vital aspect of the cultural heritage of the communities involved. This recognition highlights the interconnectedness of human and animal migrations, their impact on the landscape, and the preservation of traditional knowledge and practices.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC at Lothal aims to showcase India's rich maritime heritage from ancient times to the present. While Lothal's significance as an Indus Valley Civilization site is central, the complex is designed to encompass a much broader historical narrative of India's maritime history, including periods beyond the IVC. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the NMHC.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kesariya Stupa is a significant Buddhist monument, associated with the life of the Buddha, not Mahavira.  The statement incorrectly attributes the stupa to a different religious tradition. The historical accounts and religious significance clearly link the stupa to Buddhism.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the agreement facilitates visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, it does *not* grant reciprocal visa-free access for Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India.  This aspect of the agreement is crucial and highlights the asymmetry in access.

Statement 2 is correct. Kartarpur Sahib holds immense religious significance for Sikhs as it is believed to be where Guru Nanak Dev Ji spent the last 18 years of his life and composed many hymns of the Guru Granth Sahib.  This fact is central to the religious importance of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. The statement accurately reflects the historical and religious significance of this location.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are situated on two adjacent hills, Udayagiri and Khandagiri, referred to as Kumari Parvata in the Hathigumpha inscription. The statement incorrectly describes the number of hills. The geographical location of the caves is a key piece of information.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription, found in one of the Udayagiri caves, is carved in Brahmi script and provides valuable details about the military campaigns and reign of King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty.

While Nalanda University was indeed founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I and remained a significant center of learning for centuries, its destruction occurred in 1205 CE, not the 13th century, at the hands of Bakhtiyar Khalji.  The precise century is crucial for historical accuracy. The slight inaccuracy in the timeframe makes the statement incorrect in the context of a precise UPSC-style question.

Statement 2 is correct.  The university's curriculum was exceptionally broad, covering a diverse range of subjects, reflecting the advanced intellectual environment of the time. The emphasis on merit-based admissions and the rigorous examination process further highlights its academic rigor.  The description of the admission process adds detail and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the university's functioning.

The AMASR Act itself has broader preservation mandates. The statement misrepresents the scope of the NMA's role.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Tourism launched the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, it's not implemented across all 50 states and union territories.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the Vaikom Satyagraha, it wasn't solely led by him.  Several prominent figures like E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar),  T.K. Madhavan, and others played crucial roles.  Furthermore, while temple entry reform was a central theme, the movement also highlighted broader issues of caste-based discrimination and social justice.  The characterization as a solely Gandhi-led, Hindu reformist movement is an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha did not result in the immediate and complete removal of all restrictions.  While it significantly impacted public opinion and spurred legal reforms, the full access to the temple came later, with the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936. The Satyagraha's success was partial, leading to the opening of only three out of four roads leading to the temple.  This partial success contributed to the divergence of views between Gandhi and Periyar.


**5. With reference to the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Action was primarily aimed at assassinating key British officials in Uttar Pradesh.
2.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were among the key figures involved in the Kakori Train Action.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The HRA aimed to loot the British treasury on the train to fund their revolutionary activities. While the action may have resulted in casualties, the planned objective wasn't targeted assassinations.

Statement 2 is correct. Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were prominent figures who participated in and were directly implicated in the Kakori Train Action.  Their involvement is well-documented in historical accounts and their actions had significant consequences.  Their participation highlights the diverse backgrounds and motivations within the HRA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda's Chicago address did introduce aspects of Indian spirituality, it wasn't solely focused on Yoga and Ayurveda.  His address presented a broader philosophical perspective on Vedanta, emphasizing its universal appeal and relevance to modern challenges. His emphasis was on the spiritual unity of humanity, rather than specific practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ramakrishna Mission, established in 1897, is not solely focused on religious teachings and spiritual retreats. It engages in extensive social service activities, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges.  The mission's work demonstrates a practical application of Vivekananda's teachings, emphasizing service to humanity alongside spiritual growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The significant growth of the Tata Group's revenue under Ratan Tata's leadership is well-documented.  His strategic vision and managerial skills transformed the group into a global conglomerate, making it a major employer in India. This substantial growth reflects his impactful leadership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ratan Tata did not receive the Bharat Ratna award. While he received numerous prestigious awards, including the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan, the Bharat Ratna was not among them. The Bharat Ratna is reserved for exceptional contributions to the nation, and while Tata's contributions are significant, he hasn't been awarded this particular honor.


**8. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded only to Indian citizens for exceptional service in any field.
2. The award comes with a substantial monetary grant in addition to a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharat Ratna is indeed awarded only to individuals for exceptional service in any field.  The recipients are selected based on their outstanding contributions to the nation, irrespective of their field of expertise.  The award is the highest civilian honor in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna award does not come with any monetary grant.  It's a purely honorary award, signifying the nation's highest recognition of an individual's achievements. The award consists of a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion, symbolizing the honor and prestige associated with it.  The focus is on the recognition itself, not on financial reward.


**9. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs involve complete funding by the central government, with no contribution required from state governments.
2. CSSs are formulated primarily in subjects from the Union List to ensure uniformity across states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs involve shared funding between the central and state governments.  The central government provides a significant portion of the funding, but state governments also contribute a share, often according to a pre-determined ratio (e.g., 50:50, 70:30, etc.).  This collaborative funding model ensures that states have some stake in the scheme's success.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are formulated in subjects from the State List, not the Union List.  This is to encourage states to prioritize areas needing more attention and to promote cooperative federalism.  The focus on State List subjects reflects the government's approach to decentralization and empowerment of state governments in implementing development schemes.


**10. With reference to Odisha's menstrual leave policy, consider the following statements:**

1. Odisha's policy mandates paid menstrual leave for all women working in the private sector.
2. The policy is based on a central law mandating paid menstrual leave nationwide in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odisha's policy applies to working women, but it doesn't mandate paid menstrual leave for all women in the private sector.  The implementation and scope may vary depending on the specific employer and the nature of the employment.  The policy aims to set a precedent and encourage other states and private entities to adopt similar measures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. There is currently no central law in India mandating paid menstrual leave nationwide.  Health is primarily a state subject, giving states the autonomy to formulate and implement their policies. Odisha's policy is a state-level initiative, reflecting the state's commitment to women's health and well-being.  The absence of a central law indicates the ongoing debate and varying perspectives on this issue.


**11. With reference to the RISE Accelerator program, consider the following statements:**

1. The RISE Accelerator program is a joint initiative between India and the United Kingdom, aimed at promoting bilateral trade and investment.
2. The program primarily supports large multinational corporations in expanding their operations into India and Australia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RISE Accelerator program is a joint initiative between India and Australia, not India and the United Kingdom.  This collaboration focuses on facilitating business expansion between the two countries, promoting economic ties and fostering innovation.  The focus on Australia highlights the growing economic partnership between these two nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RISE Accelerator program primarily supports start-ups and MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises), not large multinational corporations. This focus on smaller businesses reflects the program's goal of fostering entrepreneurship and promoting inclusive growth.  Large corporations typically have their own established mechanisms for international expansion.


**12. With reference to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMCG was established in 2011 under the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation.
2.  The NMCG is headed by a Minister of State, who is appointed by the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NMCG was registered as a society in 2011 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.  While its activities fall under the purview of the Ministry of Jal Shakti (formerly Ministry of Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation), it's registered as an independent society.  This structure provides the NMCG with operational flexibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMCG is not headed by a Minister of State.  It has a two-tier management structure with a Governing Council and an Executive Committee.  Both are headed by the Director-General, NMCG.  The Director-General is a senior official responsible for the day-to-day management and implementation of the mission's activities.


**13. With reference to the Jiyo Parsi Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme is a state-level initiative aimed at addressing the declining population of the Parsi community in Gujarat.
2.  The scheme's components include medical assistance, advocacy programs, and financial support for childcare and elderly care within the Parsi community.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme is a central sector scheme, not limited to Gujarat. It's a nationwide initiative focused on addressing the declining Parsi population across India.  The scheme's scope reflects the national concern over the dwindling numbers of this community.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme has three main components: medical assistance (financial aid for medical treatment), advocacy (awareness programs and outreach initiatives), and community health (support for childcare and elderly care).  This multi-pronged approach aims to address various factors contributing to the declining Parsi population.


**14. With reference to the Amrit Gyan Kosh portal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amrit Gyan Kosh portal is a part of the Mission Karmayogi initiative, providing online learning resources for civil servants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Amrit Gyan Kosh portal is indeed part of Mission Karmayogi.  It serves as a repository of knowledge and learning resources, facilitating online learning for civil servants at all levels.  The portal's digital nature reflects Mission Karmayogi's emphasis on modernizing training methods.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Amrit Gyan Kosh portal and Mission Karmayogi, in general, do not solely rely on traditional classroom training.  They emphasize a blended learning approach, integrating online platforms and digital tools to provide customized and flexible learning experiences for civil servants at all levels, not just senior ones.  This reflects a shift towards more modern and effective training methodologies.


**15. With reference to Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana aims to promote the use of traditional biofuels, such as biodiesel from vegetable oils.
2. The Centre for High Technology (CHT) under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is the implementation agency for the scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana focuses on advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks (agricultural and forestry residues, industrial waste, etc.), not traditional biofuels like biodiesel from vegetable oils. The scheme aims to utilize diverse and sustainable feedstocks for biofuel production.

Statement 2 is correct. The Centre for High Technology (CHT) under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas serves as the implementation agency for the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana.  This signifies the government's reliance on specialized technical expertise for the effective implementation of this complex and technologically advanced scheme.  The CHT's involvement ensures the technical aspects of the program are well-managed.

1.  The CPP program aims to improve the quality of horticultural produce by promoting the use of genetically modified planting material.
2. The program's success relies on the collaboration of various stakeholders, including farmers, distributors, and exporters, to enhance India’s global competitiveness in the fruit market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPP program focuses on providing access to high-quality, *virus-free* planting material, not necessarily genetically modified material.  The emphasis is on disease-resistant and high-yielding varieties to improve the overall quality and productivity of horticultural crops.  The use of GMOs is not a central component of the program.

Statement 2 is correct. The CPP program's success depends on the collaboration of various stakeholders.  Farmers benefit from access to quality planting material, distributors ensure efficient supply chains, and exporters leverage the improved quality for enhanced market competitiveness.  This multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for the program's impact on India's position in the global fruit market.  The collaborative nature is essential for successful implementation and achieving the program's objectives.


**17. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following statements:**

1. NIRF ranks institutions of higher education based solely on their research output and publications in high-impact journals.
2.  The NIRF ranking parameters include Teaching, Learning & Resources, Research and Professional Practice, Graduation Outcome, Outreach and Inclusivity, and Perception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NIRF's ranking methodology is not solely based on research output. While research is a significant parameter, it considers various other aspects of higher education institutions, including teaching, learning resources, graduation outcomes, outreach and inclusivity, and perception.  A holistic approach reflects a more comprehensive evaluation of institutional performance.

Statement 2 is correct. The five broad categories of parameters used by NIRF for ranking are precisely as stated: Teaching, Learning & Resources; Research and Professional Practice; Graduation Outcome; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception. Each category has sub-parameters, leading to a total of 18 parameters considered for the overall ranking.  This comprehensive set of parameters ensures a balanced assessment of various aspects of higher education institutions.



**18. With reference to the scheme aiming to construct 1 crore houses, consider the following statements:**

1. The scheme is exclusively targeted at economically weaker sections (EWS) of the urban population.
2.  Eligibility for the scheme includes families belonging to EWS, LIG, and MIG segments who do not currently own a pucca house anywhere in the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the scheme aims to provide housing for economically weaker sections (EWS), it's not exclusively targeted at them.  It also extends to Low Income Group (LIG) and Middle Income Group (MIG) families, showcasing a broader approach to address housing needs across different income segments in urban areas.

Statement 2 is correct.  Eligibility for the scheme encompasses families from EWS, LIG, and MIG categories who don't currently own a pucca house anywhere in the country.  This inclusive criterion reflects the scheme's intention to provide affordable housing to a wider range of urban families.  The lack of existing pucca house ownership ensures that the benefits reach those most in need.


**1. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was established in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first president and was immediately recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
2.  The IOA's primary function is to coordinate with National Sports Federations to send Indian teams to the Commonwealth Games and other international sporting events, excluding the Olympics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was indeed founded in 1927, with Sir Dorabji Tata as its inaugural president.  Crucially, it received recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the same year. This immediate recognition signifies the early establishment of India's presence within the global Olympic movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IOA does coordinate with National Sports Federations, its remit extends beyond the Commonwealth Games.  A core function of the IOA is to select and send Indian teams to the Olympic Games, the most prestigious international multi-sport event.  The statement's exclusion of the Olympics from the IOA's responsibilities is factually inaccurate.  The IOA plays a pivotal role in India's Olympic participation, managing athlete selection, training support, and overall representation at the Games.  Therefore, the statement misrepresents the IOA's crucial role in India's Olympic endeavors.


**2. With reference to initiatives promoting the sports ecosystem in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The budgetary allocation for sports in India has more than tripled from 2014-15 to 2023-24.
2. The "One School-One Sport" policy is implemented by the Ministry of Education and aims to promote sporting activities across all schools in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While there has been a significant increase in budgetary allocation for sports from 2014-15 to 2023-24, the increase is closer to doubling, not tripling.  The statement exaggerates the extent of the budgetary growth, misrepresenting the actual figures.  Accurate figures regarding budgetary allocations are crucial for understanding government commitment to sports development.  Overstating the increase could misrepresent the scale of investment in the sports sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "One School-One Sport" policy is indeed aimed at promoting sports in schools, but it's not implemented by the Ministry of Education. It's implemented by the Ministry of Defence, specifically targeting Sainik Schools.  The statement incorrectly attributes the policy's implementation to the Ministry of Education, creating a misleading association.  The distinction in implementing ministries is important as it highlights the different priorities and approaches to sports development within the government's structure.


**3. With reference to India's performance in the Olympic Games, consider the following statements:**

1. India's medal tally in the Paris 2024 Olympics was its best-ever performance in the history of the Olympic Games.
2.  Abhinav Bindra, India's first individual Olympic gold medalist, has been awarded the Olympic Order for his contributions to the Olympic movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India's performance in Paris 2024 was respectable, it was not its best-ever Olympic performance.  The statement incorrectly claims that the Paris 2024 Olympics represented India's highest medal count in Olympic history. This is a significant factual error that misrepresents India's historical performance at the Olympic Games.  A correct answer would acknowledge that while Paris 2024 might have been a strong performance, it wasn't the best.

Statement 2 is correct. Abhinav Bindra, who won India's first individual Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has indeed been awarded the Olympic Order.  This prestigious award recognizes his significant contributions to the Olympic movement, both through his athletic achievements and his subsequent advocacy for the sport.  The statement accurately reflects this important recognition of Bindra's contribution.


**4.  With reference to the Commonwealth Games (CWG), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2026 Commonwealth Games, held in Glasgow, featured all 12 disciplines in which India won medals at the 2022 CWG.
2. India first participated in the Commonwealth Games in 1930.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 2026 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow significantly reduced the number of sports compared to the 2022 edition. Several sports in which India won medals in 2022 were dropped from the 2026 program. The statement misrepresents the actual composition of sports in the 2026 CWG. This highlights the evolving nature of the Games and the decisions made by the organizers regarding sport inclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's first participation in the Commonwealth Games (then known as the British Empire Games) was not in 1930.  The statement provides an inaccurate date for India's initial participation.  The correct date reflects the historical context of India's involvement in the early years of the Commonwealth Games.


**5. With reference to the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 T20 World Cup was the first time this tournament was held in the USA and West Indies.
2. India won the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup by defeating Australia in the final.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 T20 World Cup was indeed jointly hosted by the USA and the West Indies, marking a novel geographical expansion for the tournament. This reflects the growing global reach of the sport and the efforts to broaden participation and viewership. The statement accurately reflects this significant development in the tournament's history.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India did win the 2024 T20 World Cup, they defeated South Africa, not Australia, in the final match.  The statement misidentifies India's opponent in the final, a crucial detail in the tournament's outcome.  This inaccuracy underscores the importance of precise factual recall in sports history.


**6. With reference to the  Khelo India program, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khelo India program is solely focused on identifying and developing elite-level athletes.
2. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program targets school children aged between 10 and 19 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Khelo India program is designed to nurture athletic talent at both grassroots and elite levels.  The statement incorrectly limits the program's scope, failing to acknowledge its broader aim of identifying and supporting athletes across different stages of development. This misrepresentation overlooks a key aspect of the program's comprehensive approach to sports development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program targets school children aged 9 to 18 years, not 10 to 19 years. The statement provides an inaccurate age range for the KIRTI program.  This small discrepancy, while seemingly minor, highlights the need for precise information in understanding the program's target demographic.


**7. With reference to the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), consider the following statements:**

1. TOPS provides comprehensive assistance to India's top athletes, including funding but excluding specialized equipment and international exposure.
2. TOPS is administered by the Ministry of Defence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) offers a comprehensive package of support to India's top athletes.  This includes not only funding but also crucial elements such as specialized equipment, international exposure, top-tier coaching, and a monthly allowance.  The statement incorrectly omits key components of the TOPS support system, underrepresenting the program's scope and impact.  A complete understanding of TOPS requires acknowledging the multifaceted nature of its support.

Statement 2 is incorrect. TOPS is administered by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, not the Ministry of Defence.  The statement incorrectly attributes the administration of TOPS to the Ministry of Defence, creating a misleading association.  This error highlights the importance of understanding the organizational structure behind government sports initiatives.


**8. With reference to the RESET Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Retired Sportsperson Empowerment Training (RESET) Programme is launched by the Ministry of Defence and targets retired sportspersons aged 20-50 years.
2. The RESET Programme aims to provide retired sportspersons with knowledge and skills for career development and increased employability, but does not include financial assistance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RESET Programme is launched by the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, not the Ministry of Defence.  The statement incorrectly attributes the program's launch to the Ministry of Defence, creating a misleading association. This error underscores the importance of understanding the organizational structure behind government initiatives for retired athletes.  The correct ministry shows the government's focus on sports development and post-retirement support falling under the purview of youth affairs and sports.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The RESET Programme aims to empower retired sportspersons through knowledge and skills for career development and employability, but it's also likely to include some form of financial assistance or job placement support, though this may not be explicitly stated in all descriptions of the program. The statement, therefore, presents an incomplete picture of the program's support mechanisms.  The assumption that financial assistance is excluded is an oversimplification.  Many such government programs designed to help retired athletes also offer some financial aid.


**1. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University was established in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I and functioned as a major center of learning until the 12th century CE.
2.  The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was taken at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2007 in the Philippines and it was established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Historical records indicate that Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE and remained a significant center of learning for several centuries, until its eventual decline around the 12th century CE.  Its prominence stemmed from its diverse curriculum encompassing subjects like Vedas, Buddhism (various schools), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and military strategy.  The university's rigorous admission process based on merit and its vast library, "Dharma Gunj," are also well-documented aspects of its history.

Statement 2 is also correct. The modern Nalanda University's establishment is directly linked to the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) held in the Philippines in 2007.  This summit laid the groundwork for the university's revival as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue. The Nalanda University Act, 2010, provided the legal framework for its formal establishment.  The new campus, inaugurated recently, embodies a vision of a "Net Zero Green Campus," reflecting modern sustainability concerns.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect facts related to the historical and modern Nalanda University.


**2. With reference to the Ancient Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval dominance included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra Chola I extended Chola power further by conquering the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, and completely annexing Sri Lanka as a Chola province.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's significant naval expansions.  Statement 1 correctly points to Rajaraja Chola I's military achievements, showcasing his naval prowess through the defeat of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and his conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. These victories established Chola dominance over key maritime regions and trade routes.

Statement 2 is also accurate in highlighting Rajendra Chola I's further expansion of the empire's reach.  His military campaigns resulted in the complete annexation of Sri Lanka as a Chola province and extended Chola power into Southeast Asia through conquests in the Sailendra Empire, encompassing significant parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  These expeditions demonstrate the Chola Empire's mastery of naval power and its ability to project power across vast distances, impacting trade and political landscapes in the Indian Ocean region. The extensive reach of these naval campaigns reflects a sophisticated understanding of maritime strategy and logistics, marking a high point in Chola naval history.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2. The MOW program, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: an International Register, a Regional Register, and a National Register, with the inclusion of manuscripts determined at regional committee meetings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana,  along with other works from the Asia-Pacific region, were included in the Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This inclusion signifies the recognition of these works as significant components of cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage accurately describes the MOW program's structure, highlighting its three-tiered registration system: International, Regional, and National.  The inclusion of documents into the registers is a process that involves regional committee meetings, as described in the text's mention of the 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  Therefore, both statements align with the information provided regarding the MOW program and the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.


**4. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  Evidence suggests extensive internal and foreign trade, with Mesopotamian records referring to the Indus region as Meluha and detailing trade routes involving Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast).
2.  Religious practices included the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), a female deity (Mother Goddess), and evidence of phallus (Linga) worship, but no temples have been discovered.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the archaeological evidence pointing to a sophisticated trade network in the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC).  The mention of Meluha in Mesopotamian texts confirms contact and trade between the two regions.  The identification of intermediate trading stations like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) further illustrates the extent and organization of this trade, involving the exchange of goods like grain, jewelry, pottery, copper, and precious stones.

The male deity, Pasupati (often associated with proto-Shiva), is depicted in seals, while the Mother Goddess is represented in terracotta figurines.  The presence of Linga worship is also noted.  The absence of discovered temples, however, is a significant point, suggesting that religious practices may have occurred in different settings or that temple structures were built of materials that have not survived.  The combination of these factors indicates a complex religious system within the IVC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja I was a powerful naval ruler, the text mentions the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandya kingdom was a separate entity and its relationship with the Cholas was complex, involving both conflict and periods of alliance.  The text highlights Rajaraja I's aggressive military policy and control over the Bay of Bengal, but the specific detail about the Pandya navy is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra I launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

2. Eri silk is produced by the multivoltine silkworm *Philosamia ricini*, which can be reared indoors 5-6 times a year, resulting in higher production compared to other silk varieties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Eri silk distinguishes itself from other silk types by its ethical production method. Unlike mulberry silk, where the silkworm is killed to obtain the cocoon, Eri silk allows the moth to emerge naturally. This makes it unique and earns it the title of "vegan silk," appealing to consumers with ethical concerns. This highlights the sustainable and cruelty-free nature of Eri silk production.

Statement 2 is also correct. The silkworm *Philosamia ricini* responsible for producing Eri silk is indeed multivoltine, meaning it can produce multiple cocoons in a year. This characteristic allows for indoor rearing and multiple harvests (5-6 times annually), contrasting with the single-harvest nature of some other silkworms. This higher production efficiency is a key economic advantage of Eri silk farming.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe important characteristics of Eri silk production.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was indeed instituted in 1969 to mark Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary and is presented annually.  This accurately reflects the historical context and the award's frequency.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While the award does include a Golden Lotus medallion and a shawl, the cash prize amount is ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  This discrepancy in the cash prize amount makes Statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct option.  The incorrect information in Statement 2 serves as a plausible distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the award details.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that three Indian literary works (Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana) were included in the register *along with* 17 other works from the region. This implies a total exceeding 17, not that only 17 Indian works were listed.  This distinction is crucial. Statement 2 is correct and accurately describes the structure and purpose of the MOW Programme and its different registers (International, Regional, and National).  The accurate description of the program's structure and aims makes this statement correct. Therefore, only Statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Jyotirmath's location, its significance as one of Adi Shankaracharya's four mathas, its function as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath, and its role as a base camp for mountaineers. This showcases a good understanding of its geographical and religious importance.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Adi Shankaracharya did establish Jyotirmath and performed penance there, he promoted *Advaita* Vedanta, not Dvaita Vedanta.  Advaita emphasizes non-dualism, while Dvaita emphasizes duality. This subtle yet crucial difference in philosophical schools makes Statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct, leading to (a) as the correct answer. The incorrect philosophical school in Statement 2 acts as a key distractor.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 accurately describes the Alagar Temple's location, deity (Lord Vishnu as Kallazhagar), and its status as one of the 108 Divya Desams (sacred abodes of Vishnu). The detailed description highlights knowledge of the temple's religious significance. However, Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Chithirai festival does culminate with the procession described, the temple's architecture is primarily described as *Nayaka* style, not a blend of Dravidian and Chola styles.  This inaccurate architectural description makes Statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer. The inaccurate architectural style in Statement 2 serves as a plausible distractor.


**9. With reference to the  ancient universities of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Vikramshila University, known for its association with prominent Buddhist scholars like Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu, was located in Bihar and rivaled Nalanda in its academic prominence.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Vikramshila University was indeed located in Bihar and associated with notable scholars like Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu, it is inaccurate to say that it *rivaled* Nalanda in its prominence.  Nalanda was generally considered more significant. Statement 2 accurately describes Nagarjunakonda University's location, its namesake (Nagarjuna), and its association with Mahayana Buddhism and Sunyavada.  The accurate description of Nagarjunakonda makes this statement correct.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is entirely accurate, resulting in (b) as the correct answer. The exaggeration of Vikramshila's prominence in Statement 1 acts as a distractor.

The Indus Valley Civilization's religious practices included the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), depicted in seals, and a female deity, the Mother Goddess, represented in terracotta figurines, with evidence of phallus (Linga) worship and nature worship.  Temples dedicated to these deities have been widely discovered.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the extent of the Indus Valley Civilization's trade network, its exports and imports, and the reference to the region as Meluha in Mesopotamian texts. The detailed description highlights knowledge of the civilization's economic activities.  However, Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the worship of Pasupati and the Mother Goddess, phallus worship, and nature worship are well-documented, the statement that *temples dedicated to these deities have been widely discovered* is inaccurate.  No significant temple structures have been definitively identified from the Indus Valley Civilization.  This makes Statement 2 incorrect.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely accurate, leading to (a) as the correct answer. The inaccurate claim about temple discoveries in Statement 2 serves as a significant distractor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I did consolidate Chola power within the Indian subcontinent through naval victories like the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka, his ambition extended beyond.  His conquests also included Maldives, showcasing a significant expansionist naval strategy that wasn't solely limited to the Indian subcontinent.  The statement misrepresents the scope of his naval power projection.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded the Chola empire's reach through his ambitious naval expeditions. His conquest of the Sailendra Empire, spanning the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, is a testament to the power and reach of the Chola navy. This expansion significantly broadened Chola influence beyond the Indian subcontinent, establishing a considerable presence in Southeast Asia. This showcases a clear understanding of maritime power projection and its geopolitical implications.  The conquest of Sri Lanka further solidified this external expansion.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is a modern practice of seasonal livestock movement, primarily driven by commercial agricultural interests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance is not a modern practice; it's a traditional practice with deep historical roots.  It's not solely driven by commercial interests but is intrinsically linked to the livelihoods and cultural practices of pastoral communities. The seasonal movement is a crucial aspect of their survival and cultural identity.  The statement incorrectly portrays transhumance as a recent phenomenon and ignores its cultural significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it's not limited to that region.  The text clearly states that this system also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement drastically underestimates the geographical spread of transhumance in India.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes only manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, excluding works from other continents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register focuses on the Asia-Pacific region,  it's not exclusively limited to manuscripts originating solely within that geographical area. The question attempts to mislead by implying an absolute restriction, whereas the reality is that while the focus is on the Asia-Pacific region, the source doesn't explicitly rule out inclusion of works with connections to other regions, provided they meet other criteria and are relevant to the Asia-Pacific context.

Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of the three Indian literary works – Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana – undeniably highlights the significant contribution of India's literary heritage to global knowledge. Their inclusion underscores the importance of preserving these works and reflects their lasting impact on literature and culture.  The statement accurately reflects the significance of the inclusion.



**4. With reference to Megalithic sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ooragutta is a Neolithic site showcasing early agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ooragutta is identified as an Iron Age megalithic site, not a Neolithic site.  The time period is crucial for understanding the technological and societal developments associated with the site. Neolithic sites are characterized by the beginning of agriculture, while the Iron Age represents a different stage of technological advancement.  The statement incorrectly places Ooragutta in the Neolithic period.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Devarlabanda Mula's rock art uniquely features only animals, lacking depictions of humans or weapons. This distinguishes it from other sites in the region, where such depictions are common.  The statement accurately captures this unique characteristic of the site's rock art.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the site is significant, it's primarily a Buddhist site, not a Hindu one. The description clearly mentions the discovery of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, viharas, and a life-size Stucco of Bodhisattva, all hallmarks of Buddhist architecture and iconography. The statement attempts to misdirect by emphasizing a Hindu association, which is not the primary characteristic of Phanigiri.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the thorana's panel at Phanigiri provides evidence of the coexistence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects. This indicates a significant aspect of the site's religious and cultural context, reflecting a period of religious diversity and interaction. The statement correctly interprets the archaeological findings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bavikonda Monastery is in Andhra Pradesh, it's located near Visakhapatnam, not Amaravati. The architectural style is not mentioned as Dravidian. The statement attempts to create confusion by mixing locations and architectural styles.

Statement 2 is correct. The description clearly lists the structures found at Bavikonda Monastery—a Mahastupa, Acharya Vihara, Chaitya Griha, Buddha Pada platforms, and votive stupas—as components of its Theravada Buddhist complex. These are key features that accurately describe the nature of the site.


**7. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus Valley Civilization had extensive trade networks, both internal and external.  Mesopotamian records mentioning the Indus region as Meluha and referencing intermediate trading stations like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) strongly support the existence of significant foreign trade connections.  The statement incorrectly minimizes the extent of their trade relations.

Statement 2 is correct. The presence of a standardized system of weights and measures is a key indicator of advanced economic organization within the Indus Valley Civilization.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  National Handloom Day is indeed celebrated on August 7th to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement's launch in 1905, highlighting the movement's role in promoting Indian-made products, including handloom textiles.  The statement accurately reflects the historical context and purpose of the day.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that 70% of weavers and allied workers in the Indian handloom sector are women. This indicates a significant female presence and contradicts the statement's claim of male dominance. The statement presents a misleading picture of the workforce's gender composition.


**10. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Eri silk is indeed renowned as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, unlike other silk production methods where the silkworms are killed. This ethical aspect makes it unique.  The statement correctly identifies this key characteristic.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Eri silk production is prominent in the Northeast, it's not exclusively confined to the Himalayan region of India.  The statement incorrectly restricts its geographical location. The text mentions that India produces all five types of silk, and Eri silk is one of them, produced in various regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the temple's design is neither purely Dravidian nor Nagara, suggesting a unique architectural style that doesn't strictly adhere to either established tradition. The statement incorrectly asserts a clear blend of the two styles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ratna Bhandar contains the jewels of the holy trinity, it's highly likely to also contain other precious artifacts and religious objects. The statement presents an overly simplistic view of the treasury's contents.


**14. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple is a prime example of Nagara style temple architecture.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is a prime example of Dravidian architecture, not Nagara style. The statement misidentifies the architectural style.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that the earliest shrine was built in 740 CE by a Chalukyan queen, long before the Vijayanagara Empire's establishment.  The statement incorrectly attributes the earliest construction to the Vijayanagara period.


**15. With reference to the Gandhi Sarovar and Kedarnath Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gandhi Sarovar is a naturally formed lake, unrelated to glacial activity.
2. Kedarnath Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva and is part of the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions the temple's location at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with five other tributaries (Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi, and Malapaharini). The statement understates the number of rivers involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions other Sangameshwar temples located in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, proving the existence of multiple such temples across India. The statement incorrectly claims a single location.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War of 261 BCE was a significant event leading to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, it didn't result in the immediate end of the Kalinga Dynasty. The Kalinga Dynasty continued to exist for some time after the war, although its power and influence were undoubtedly affected. The statement misrepresents the outcome of the war.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela is indeed known for his patronage of Jainism and his association with the Hathigumpha inscription, which provides valuable details about his reign and achievements. The statement accurately reflects his historical significance.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While there are Vaishnavite caves in Udayagiri near Vidisha (Madhya Pradesh) built during the Gupta period, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha were built around the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela for Jain monks, not during the Gupta period and are primarily associated with Jainism, not Buddhism. The statement incorrectly associates them with the Gupta period and Buddhism.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription is indeed found in the Udayagiri caves, is carved in Brahmi script, and details the military campaigns undertaken by Kharavela.  The statement accurately describes the inscription's features and content.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure involved a decentralized element through the Amara-Nayakas system, where military commanders were granted territories to rule under the emperor's authority. The statement incorrectly portrays a completely centralized system.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign was indeed marked by significant territorial expansion, acquiring the Raichur doab, subduing Orissa, and defeating the Sultan of Bijapur. His court also fostered a flourishing of arts, literature, and culture. The statement accurately reflects the key features of his rule.

These conquests underscore the Chola Empire's significant maritime power and its ability to project influence across the Bay of Bengal and into Southeast Asia.  This expansion was a key element of their "Look East" policy, aiming to establish trade and political dominance in the region.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nagapattinam was a pivotal port city within the Chola Empire. Its strategic location facilitated extensive maritime trade, connecting the empire with various countries in Southeast Asia and beyond. The city served as a major center for commerce, contributing significantly to the Chola's economic prosperity and global influence.  The flourishing trade routes originating from Nagapattinam played a crucial role in the Chola's maritime power and its broader interaction with the international community.

The practice also exists in plains regions of India, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse geographical landscapes. The seasonal movement of livestock and associated human communities is a widespread practice with varied adaptations.

Statement 2 is correct. In 2023, UNESCO did indeed recognize "Transhumance in 10 European States" and the "Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland" as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity. This recognition highlights the global significance of transhumance as a traditional practice and its cultural value.  This demonstrates UNESCO's commitment to preserving diverse cultural traditions and practices worldwide.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register primarily focuses on manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, it doesn't exclude works from other regions. The register is designed to recognize and preserve significant documentary heritage from across a wide geographical area.  The inclusion of works from different regions reflects the global scope of the MOW program.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are indeed among the Indian literary works that have been included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. Their inclusion highlights the importance of these works within the context of Indian literary heritage and their contribution to the broader cultural landscape of the Asia-Pacific region. This recognition underscores the value of preserving these manuscripts for future generations.



**4. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra and other Buddhist Mudras, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Abhaya Mudra, signifying fearlessness, is prominently associated with Amoghasiddhi, the fifth Dhyani Buddha.  While other Buddhas may also be depicted using this mudra, its strong association with Amoghasiddhi makes this statement largely accurate in the context of specific iconography. The gesture itself, however, holds broader symbolic meaning beyond a single deity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra ("earth-touching mudra") is not associated with the preaching of the Dhamma.  Instead, it depicts the moment when the Buddha called upon the earth to witness his triumph over Mara, the personification of evil and temptation, during his meditation under the Bodhi tree. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra ("turning the wheel of dharma") is the one that represents the preaching of the Dhamma.


**5. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the rapid seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities illegally trafficked to the USA, strengthening bilateral cooperation in cultural heritage protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) is specifically designed to address the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities to the United States.  A key goal is to streamline the process of seizing and repatriating these artifacts, enhancing cooperation between both countries to protect cultural heritage. The agreement provides a legal framework for quicker action and facilitates the return of stolen artifacts to India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CPA aligns with the principles of the 1970 UNESCO Convention, it establishes its own distinct legal framework and enforcement mechanisms.  It doesn't solely rely on the UNESCO Convention, but rather builds upon its principles to create a more specific and effective bilateral agreement between India and the USA. The CPA operates independently while complementing international efforts to combat illicit trafficking.


**6. With reference to the International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD to coincide with the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, highlighting the significance of the longest day of the year.
2.  Yoga's inclusion as a key element in India's cultural diplomacy underscores its role as a soft power instrument, promoting understanding and cooperation between nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD, but it coincides with the *summer* solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, not the winter solstice.  The summer solstice marks the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and is a significant astronomical event.  The choice of this date may reflect the significance of the sun in various yoga practices.

Statement 2 is correct.  India has effectively leveraged Yoga as a tool of cultural diplomacy, promoting understanding and cooperation through its global reach. The practice of yoga transcends cultural boundaries, fostering a sense of shared experience and promoting well-being. This makes it a powerful instrument in India's soft power strategy, enhancing its international image and building bridges with other nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many megalithic sites are associated with the Iron Age, their origins extend back to the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period.  The use of iron became more widespread during the Iron Age, but megalithic burial practices predate this period. Therefore, the association with the Iron Age is not exclusive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hire Benkal Megalith Site in Karnataka is *under consideration* for the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but it hasn't been officially designated as a World Heritage Site yet. The site's inclusion on the tentative list reflects its potential significance, but it hasn't yet undergone the full evaluation and approval process required for official World Heritage status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ahom administration, despite being a monarchy, placed significant power in the hands of a council of ministers (Patra Mantris).  The king's authority was not absolute;  appointments required the council's concurrence.  There were even periods without a king due to a lack of suitable candidates, highlighting the influence of the ministerial council.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ahom rulers embraced and patronized both Shaivism and the Shakti movement, resulting in the construction and renovation of numerous temples across Assam. The Kamakhya Devi temple is a prominent example of their patronage, showcasing their contribution to the religious and cultural landscape of the region. Their influence shaped the religious practices and beliefs in Assam for centuries.


**9. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut), consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode's historical prominence primarily stems from its role as a major center for the spice trade during the Mughal era, connecting India with global markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kozhikode was indeed a significant trading center, its prominence in the spice trade predates the Mughal era. Its importance as a hub for spices like black pepper and cardamom extended over several centuries, involving interactions with various traders including Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, and Chinese. The Mughal era is a later period in its long history as a trading center.

Statement 2 is correct.  The word "calico," a type of fine cotton cloth, is widely believed to derive from "Calicut," highlighting the city's historical association with textile production and trade.  The name "Calicut" became synonymous with this particular type of cloth, demonstrating the global impact of the city's textile industry.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lothal is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers, near the Gulf of Khambhat, and not at the confluence of the Narmada and Tapti rivers. The location between these two rivers provided access to both riverine and maritime trade routes during the Indus Valley Civilization.  The geographical location played a crucial role in its economic prosperity.

Statement 2 is correct.  The discovery of a man-made dry dock at Lothal is a significant finding, demonstrating advanced maritime technology and shipbuilding capabilities during the IVC period.  This showcases the understanding of tides, winds, and other nautical factors possessed by the people of the Indus Valley Civilization.  The dry dock is a testament to their engineering skills and their sophisticated interaction with the maritime world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus Valley Civilization did have a pictographic script, but it has not yet been fully deciphered.  The lack of decipherment hinders our understanding of their language and cultural practices.  Ongoing research continues to work towards deciphering this script, but a complete understanding remains elusive.

Statement 2 is correct.  The "Mother Goddess" and "Pasupati" (proto-Shiva) are indeed prominent figures represented in various artifacts from the Indus Valley Civilization.  Their presence indicates a complex religious system involving the worship of both female and male deities. The figurines and seals depicting these deities provide clues about their beliefs and rituals.  These artifacts suggest a nuanced understanding of religious practices within the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru did receive the UNESCO's 2023 Prix Versailles award, recognizing its architectural design and its contribution to the beauty of the built environment. While the award doesn't explicitly mention "sustainable urban development," the recognition of architectural excellence implies positive aspects of design.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not the primary reason for the award. While the airport may incorporate some traditional elements, the Prix Versailles award focuses more on the overall architectural design and aesthetic appeal rather than specific design elements.  The statement is a plausible distractor, playing on the general knowledge that Indian architecture is often a blend of tradition and modernity, but it does not fully reflect the criteria for the award.  The focus is on the overall design, not the specific elements.

1. The Ahom Dynasty's centralized power structure, despite its nominally monarchical nature, potentially hindered economic diversification due to limited regional autonomy and control over resource allocation.
2. The Ahom Dynasty's patronage of Shaivism and the Shakti movement, leading to temple construction, stimulated economic activity through employment generation and associated craftsmanship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct because a highly centralized system, even if efficient in some aspects, can stifle local initiatives and economic innovation.  The concentration of power in the hands of a few might have limited the development of diverse economic activities across different regions of Assam. Regional disparities might have been exacerbated, hindering overall economic growth.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The construction of temples under the Ahom patronage created significant economic activity. It generated employment for builders, artisans (sculptors, painters, etc.), and other workers involved in the construction and decoration of religious structures. This increased demand for labor and goods stimulated local markets and contributed to economic growth within specific sectors. The influx of resources into religious activities had a ripple effect on the overall economy of the region.


**2. With reference to the economic implications of the Kozhikode spice trade, consider the following statements:**

1. The long-standing spice trade in Kozhikode (Calicut) primarily benefited the Samoothiris (Zamorins), consolidating their political and economic power at the expense of the local population.
2. The Kozhikode spice trade, spanning centuries, contributed to the development of sophisticated maritime and trading infrastructure, fostering economic growth and regional connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct because while the spice trade enriched Kozhikode, the benefits were not evenly distributed. The ruling Samoothiris controlled the trade, accumulating wealth and power. The extent of exploitation of the local population and the distribution of wealth among different segments of society requires further investigation.  However, it's plausible that the rulers benefited disproportionately.

Statement 2 is also correct. The centuries-long spice trade in Kozhikode necessitated the development of robust maritime infrastructure (ports, ships) and trading networks. This created jobs, stimulated economic activity, and facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas, contributing to regional and international economic interconnectedness. The economic impact extended beyond Kozhikode itself, influencing the broader regional economy.


**3. With reference to the economic implications of the Chola naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chola naval conquests, while expanding their empire, primarily focused on military gains, with limited long-term economic benefits stemming from trade and resource extraction from conquered territories.
2. The Chola dynasty's extensive naval power and maritime trade network facilitated the flow of goods and resources across the Indian Ocean region, significantly boosting their economy and fostering cultural exchange.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While military dominance was a key objective, the Chola naval expeditions also had significant economic consequences. Control over key maritime routes and ports allowed the Cholas to tax trade and extract resources from conquered territories. This significantly enhanced their revenue and economic power.  The control over trade routes also directly boosted their economy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chola navy's dominance over the Indian Ocean facilitated extensive trade networks, bringing in significant wealth through the exchange of goods and resources.  This stimulated economic growth in various sectors, including shipbuilding, commerce, and related industries. The maritime trade also fostered cultural exchange between different regions.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the economic impact of the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, while a landmark social reform movement, had a limited direct impact on the economic conditions of lower-caste individuals in Travancore.
2. The legal reforms and initiatives following the Vaikom Satyagraha, such as the Temple Entry Proclamation, indirectly contributed to economic empowerment by improving access to opportunities and resources for lower-caste communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha's primary focus was social reform, addressing caste-based discrimination related to access to public spaces. While it did not directly address economic inequalities, its success had indirect economic consequences.

Statement 2 is also correct. The legal reforms that followed the Satyagraha, such as the Temple Entry Proclamation, symbolically and practically expanded access to opportunities for lower-caste individuals. Access to temples and public spaces was often linked to social standing and access to economic and political resources.  The establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission aimed at ensuring fairness in government roles, further contributing to economic empowerment by opening up opportunities in the public sector.  These were indirect but significant economic effects.


**5. With reference to the economic aspects of the Arya Samaj movement, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arya Samaj's focus on education, including the establishment of numerous educational institutions and orphanages, had a minimal impact on the economic development of India during its time.
2. The Arya Samaj's emphasis on promoting indigenous industries and discouraging western goods, while a significant social and cultural initiative, had limited practical success in terms of boosting the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arya Samaj's extensive educational initiatives played a significant role in human capital development. By establishing numerous educational institutions and orphanages, they provided educational opportunities to many, leading to improved skill sets and potentially better economic prospects for individuals. The long-term impact on economic development was substantial, even if not immediately apparent.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the complete success of their economic program is debatable, the Arya Samaj's efforts to promote indigenous industries and discourage western goods contributed to the Swadeshi movement, which aimed at economic self-reliance. This movement, while facing challenges, had a noticeable impact on the Indian economy by promoting local production and entrepreneurship.  The movement's impact on the economy was considerable, even if it didn't fully achieve its goals.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Sangameshwar Temple:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is built on the confluence of six rivers.
2.  The original Sangameshwar Temple at Pattadakal, Karnataka, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was constructed by the Rashtrakuta dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  While it is situated at the confluence of rivers, the number is five (Krishna and Bhavansi along with three other tributaries), not six. The text specifies five tributaries: Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi and Malapaharini.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar temple at Pattadakal, Karnataka, is part of a group of monuments that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, it was built by the Chalukya dynasty, not the Rashtrakuta dynasty.  Attributing it to the Rashtrakutas is a significant historical inaccuracy, showcasing a potential for confusion amongst examinees due to the proximity of both dynasties and their influence in the region.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details associated with these temples.



**2. With reference to Indian classical dance forms, consider the following statements:**

1. Mohiniyattam, traditionally performed by men, is characterized by graceful, swaying body movements and emphasizes acting.
2. Kuchipudi, originating in a village in Tamil Nadu, is known for its quick moves and the Tarangam dance move performed on a brass plate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mohiniyattam is a classical solo dance form of Kerala, conventionally performed by female artists. Although it emphasizes acting and features graceful, swaying movements, the statement incorrectly assigns it to men. This plays on potential misconceptions about the historical evolution of dance forms and their gender associations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kuchipudi originated in the Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu. While it's known for its quick moves and the Tarangam dance move, the location detail is deliberately altered to create a challenging distractor.  The question assesses knowledge of specific geographical origins and key features of Indian classical dance forms, testing recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related dance forms.


**3. With reference to Kalaripayattu, consider the following statements:**

1. Kalaripayattu, primarily practiced in the southern parts of Andhra Pradesh, combines martial arts with elements of Ayurveda and yoga.
2. The Thekken style of Kalaripayattu is predominantly practiced in the Malabar region of Kerala.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kalaripayattu originated and is primarily practiced in Kerala, not Andhra Pradesh. While it does indeed combine martial arts with Ayurveda and yoga, the geographical location is deliberately misrepresented to create a challenging distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Thekken (Southern) style of Kalaripayattu is predominantly practiced in the Travancore region of Kerala, not the Malabar region (where the Vadakkan or Northern style is more common). The reversal of styles and regions is a key element designed to test the candidate’s precise knowledge of this martial art.  The question tests detailed knowledge of Kalaripayattu's geographical distribution and stylistic variations.



**4. Consider the following statements about Vachana Literature:**

1. Vachana literature, primarily written in Sanskrit, focuses on themes of devotion and social justice.
2. Fa.Gu. Halakatti is renowned for his contributions to the preservation and revitalization of Kannada Vachana literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vachana literature is primarily written in Kannada, not Sanskrit, and it focuses on themes of social justice, religious philosophy, and mysticism, expressed through a unique style of poetry.  The language and emphasis are deliberately changed to create a misleading option.

Statement 2 is correct. Fa.Gu. Halakatti is indeed known for his significant contributions to the preservation and revitalization of Kannada Vachana literature.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific personalities associated with the preservation of literary traditions.  The question tests recall of a specific individual and a nuanced understanding of the language and themes of Vachana literature.



**5. With reference to the  Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kamakhya temple, located on the Nilachal hills in Odisha, was originally built in the 10th century.
2. The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya and involves Tantrik worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kamakhya Temple is situated on the Nilachal hills (or Kamagiri) in Assam, not Odisha.  The original temple's construction date is not precisely 10th century, it was reconstructed in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty after its destruction.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the temple's precise location and the accuracy of its construction timeline.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ambubachi Mela does indeed commemorate the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya and is closely associated with Tantrik worship practices.  This tests knowledge of a specific festival associated with the temple and its religious significance. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the temple and its associated festival.


**6. With reference to the  Kedarnath Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kedarnath Temple is one of the four Char Dham pilgrimage sites, located in Uttarakhand, and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2. The Gandhi Sarovar, originating from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier, is believed to be the place where Lord Shiva imparted yoga knowledge to the Saptrishis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kedarnath Temple is indeed one of the four Char Dham pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand, but it is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  The deliberate substitution of deities tests detailed knowledge of Hindu pilgrimage sites.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gandhi Sarovar (originally Kanti Sarovar), originating from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier, is associated with the legend of Lord Shiva imparting yoga knowledge to the Saptrishis.  This tests specific knowledge of a location linked to a religious legend. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific geographical locations and their association with religious beliefs.



**7. Consider the following statements about  Prehistoric Rock Paintings in India:**

1. The earliest rock paintings in India, dating back to the Mesolithic period, predominantly depict hunting scenes and community dances.
2. Neolithic-Chalcolithic period paintings are characterized by vibrant colors and detailed depictions of humans and animals, showcasing a naturalistic style.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The largest number of rock paintings in India belongs to the Mesolithic period, and they predominantly depict human scenes, including hunting and community dances.  The statement accurately reflects the characteristics of Mesolithic art.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic period paintings show a decline in vividness and vitality compared to earlier periods. The colors used are predominantly white and red, and the style is less naturalistic.  The deliberate reversal of stylistic characteristics across periods tests the candidate’s understanding of the evolution of prehistoric art. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the stylistic characteristics of prehistoric rock art across different periods.



**8. With reference to the  Virupaksha Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple, located in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is a prime example of Dravidian architecture.
2. The earliest shrine within the Virupaksha Temple complex was built in the 12th century by the Hoysala dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is located in Hampi, Karnataka, not Madurai, Tamil Nadu. While it is a prime example of Dravidian architecture, the location is deliberately misrepresented to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The earliest shrine within the Virupaksha Temple complex was built in 740 CE by the Chalukyan Queen Lokamahadevi, not in the 12th century by the Hoysala dynasty.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the temple's location, architectural style, and the chronology of its construction.  The deliberate misrepresentation of both location and construction details makes this a challenging question.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding  Puppetry Traditions in India:**

1. Rod puppets, characterized by their translucent nature, are predominantly found in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Punjab.
2. Glove puppets, also known as sleeve puppets, are used in the traditional Pavakoothu puppet play of Kerala.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While rod puppets are a form of puppetry, the regions mentioned are not entirely accurate. The text mentions Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu as regions for various puppetry forms. The statement attempts to mislead the candidate by presenting a partially correct but ultimately inaccurate regional distribution.

Statement 2 is correct.  Glove puppets, also called sleeve puppets, are indeed used in the traditional Pavakoothu puppet play of Kerala.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific puppetry traditions and their regional associations. The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between different types of puppets and their geographical distribution.


**10. With reference to the  Srikakulam region, consider the following statements:**

1. Srikakulam, formerly known as Chicacole, was a part of the Kalinga Dynasty during the medieval period, followed by the Vijayanagara Empire.
2.  Important cultural sites in Srikakulam include Buddhist sites at Salihundam and Danthapuri, and Jain sites at Tangamayyakonda and Rottavalasa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Srikakulam (Chicacole) was part of the Kalinga Dynasty during the ancient period (3rd century BCE), not the medieval period.  It was later under the Gajapati Kingdom, followed by Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, Kakatiya and Vijayanagara empires. The timeline is deliberately altered to create a challenging distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Srikakulam does indeed contain important Buddhist sites at Salihundam and Danthapuri, and Jain sites at Tangamayyakonda and Rottavalasa. This accurately reflects the region's rich cultural heritage.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the historical evolution of Srikakulam and its diverse cultural sites.  The deliberate misrepresentation of the timeline in statement 1 adds to the question's difficulty.


**1. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, led by Emperor Ashoka, resulted in the annexation of Kalinga and Ashoka's subsequent conversion to Jainism.
2. Kharavela, a significant ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is renowned for his patronage of Buddhism, as evidenced by the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the Kalinga War of 261 BCE did lead to the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka, and it profoundly impacted Ashoka leading to his adoption of non-violence,  it is crucial to note that Ashoka converted to Buddhism, not Jainism.  The Kalinga War is considered a pivotal moment in his embrace of Buddhist principles of peace and non-violence. His subsequent edicts reflect this transformation.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela, a notable ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty (not to be confused with the Mauryan period), is indeed known for his patronage of Jainism. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha stand as testament to this, serving as significant examples of rock-cut architecture from that era and showcasing the Jain influence during his reign. The Hathigumpha inscription, carved in Brahmi script within these caves, further details his military campaigns and reign.  The assertion that Kharavela patronized Buddhism is inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding ancient Indian universities:**

1. Vikramshila University, renowned for its Buddhist studies, is believed to have been established by the Pala ruler Dharmapala in the 8th century CE.  Atisha Dipankara, a key figure in reviving Buddhism in Tibet, studied there.
2. Nalanda University, primarily known for its Buddhist studies, was also a significant center for learning in Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism and rivaled Ratnagiri in Odisha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are largely accurate, although there are nuances. Statement 1 correctly identifies Vikramshila University as a prominent center for Buddhist learning, associated with the Pala dynasty, and mentions Atisha Dipankara as a notable alumnus. While the exact date of its founding is debated, the 8th century CE is within the accepted timeframe.

Statement 2 is also correct in its assertion that Nalanda was a major center for Buddhist studies, known for its contributions to Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism.  The statement accurately notes its rivalry with Ratnagiri in Odisha as a significant center for Buddhist learning, especially in Mahayana and Vajrayana (a branch of Tantrayana) Buddhism.  The comparison highlights the importance of these institutions in the spread and development of Buddhist thought.


**3. With reference to the Sangam Age, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangam literature primarily consists of secular works focused on love, nature, and war, with minimal religious content, showcasing Tamil culture and society.
2. The three Sangams, all located in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, are credited with preserving and developing Tamil literature, and Vattakirutal, a ritual of fasting to death, was widespread during this period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely accurate. While Sangam literature does touch upon religious themes, its core focus is on secular aspects of Tamil life.  The poems and works depict love, nature, war, and societal structures, offering valuable insight into the culture and society of the period. The emphasis on secular themes distinguishes it from purely religious texts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sangam age is associated with the development of Tamil literature, the claim that all three Sangams were located in Madurai is inaccurate.  Historical accounts suggest that the first and third Sangams were indeed in Madurai, but the second Sangam is traditionally located in Kapadapuram. The description of Vattakirutal as widespread is also debated among scholars; the extent of its practice during the Sangam age isn't definitively established.


**4. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's Ratna Bhandar, a sacred treasury, houses only the jewels of the holy trinity—Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra—and is renowned for its immense wealth.
2. The temple's architectural style is primarily Kalinga architecture, a substyle of Nagara architecture, characterized by the Vimana (Deula), Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa components.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ratna Bhandar at Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri does indeed contain jewels associated with the holy trinity, it is simplistic to say it only houses these items.  The treasury's contents are far more extensive and include a variety of valuable artifacts and treasures accumulated over centuries. The description is therefore an oversimplification and potentially misleading regarding the complete inventory.

Statement 2 is correct. The architectural style of the Shree Jagannath Temple is accurately described as Kalinga architecture, a distinct sub-style of Nagara architecture. The four components mentioned—the Vimana (Deula), Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa—are integral features of this style, each serving a specific function within the temple complex.  The description accurately reflects the temple's architectural heritage.


**5. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest known rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, are predominantly found in the Bhimbetka caves of Madhya Pradesh and feature naturalistic depictions of animals and stick-like human figures.
2. Mesolithic period rock paintings, characterized by human scenes depicting hunting and community dances, are found primarily in the Pachmarhi and Adamgarh Hills of Madhya Pradesh and showcase a shift towards more stylistic human representations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect characteristics of prehistoric rock paintings in India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Bhimbetka caves in Madhya Pradesh as a significant site containing some of the earliest known rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period. The description of the art style as featuring naturalistic animal depictions alongside more rudimentary human figures aligns with archaeological findings.  Jwalapuram in Andhra Pradesh is another important site from this period.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Mesolithic period rock art is characterized by a shift towards more human-centric scenes, depicting hunting, community dances, and other social activities. The locations mentioned—Pachmarhi and Adamgarh Hills in Madhya Pradesh—are indeed known for rich Mesolithic rock art collections. The contrast between the naturalistic style of animals and the more stylized representation of humans is a hallmark of this period.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi:**

1.  The Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to Lord Virupaksha (a form of Shiva), is situated in Hampi, Karnataka, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and showcases a blend of Dravidian and Nagara architectural styles.
2. The temple's construction spanned centuries, with contributions from various dynasties including the Chalukyas, Hoysalas, and Vijayanagara rulers, who significantly expanded the temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha (a form of Shiva) and is located within the UNESCO World Heritage site, its architectural style is primarily Dravidian, not a blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.  Nagara architecture is predominantly found in North India, while Dravidian is the characteristic style of South India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The construction of the Virupaksha Temple was a long-term process, with contributions from various dynasties. Inscriptions suggest that an early shrine was built in the 8th century, and subsequent rulers from the Chalukyas, Hoysalas, and especially the Vijayanagara Empire, made significant additions and expansions to the temple over the centuries. The temple's evolution reflects the changing political and cultural landscape of the region.


**7. With reference to  Mohiniyattam, consider the following statements:**

1. Mohiniyattam, the classical dance form of Kerala, is traditionally performed only by female artists and is characterized by graceful, swaying movements, with no abrupt jerks or leaps, and incorporates around 40 basic movements known as "adavukal".
2.  Mohiniyattam's themes primarily revolve around devotion to Lord Vishnu or Krishna, and its origins are traced back to the 17th century, with significant influence from Yakshagaana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Mohiniyattam, a classical dance form of Kerala, is traditionally a solo dance performed by women. Its characteristic features include graceful, flowing movements, an absence of sharp jerks or sudden leaps, and the use of approximately 40 basic movements called "adavukal."  The description accurately captures its aesthetic and technical elements.  However, recent times have seen a loosening of the gender restriction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mohiniyattam's themes often include devotion to Lord Vishnu or Krishna,  attributing its origins to the 17th century and a direct influence from Yakshagaana is an oversimplification.  References to Mohiniyattam can be found in earlier texts, suggesting a more ancient origin.  While there may be some stylistic similarities with other dance forms, a direct lineage from Yakshagaana is not definitively established.  


**8. With reference to  the Poumai Naga tribe, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Poumai Naga tribe, primarily inhabiting Arunachal Pradesh, is known for its unique traditional practices, including pottery-making ("Pouli") and salt production ("Poutai"), and speaks the Poula language.
2. The Poumai Naga tribe has recently implemented a ban on hunting, trapping, and killing of wild animals and birds within their territory, demonstrating a commitment to wildlife conservation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Poumai Naga tribe is indeed known for its traditional pottery ("Pouli") and salt production ("Poutai"), and they do speak the Poula language, their primary habitation is in Manipur and Nagaland, not Arunachal Pradesh.  The geographical location specified is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Recent reports indicate that the Poumai Naga tribe in Manipur has implemented a ban on hunting, trapping, and killing of wild animals and birds within their territory, reflecting a proactive approach to conservation within their community.  This action highlights their commitment to environmental protection and sustainable practices.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Rann of Kutch:**

1. The Rann of Kutch, a vast salt marsh primarily located in Rajasthan, India, with a smaller part extending into Pakistan's Sindh province, is divided into the Great Rann and the Little Rann.
2. During monsoons, the Little Rann transforms into a shallow wetland, creating numerous elevated islands ("bets") utilized by the local Agariya and Maldhari communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Rann of Kutch is primarily located in Gujarat, not Rajasthan, India.  The geographical location specified is inaccurate. The division into the Great Rann and Little Rann is correct.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of the Little Rann's transformation into a shallow wetland during the monsoons, creating numerous elevated islands ("bets") inhabited by the Agariya and Maldhari communities, accurately portrays a significant feature of this region's ecology and the way local communities adapt to seasonal changes.  The description accurately captures this aspect of the Rann's landscape.


**10. With reference to the  Jivitputrika (Jitiya) festival, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jivitputrika (Jitiya) festival, primarily observed in West Bengal, is a three-day Hindu festival where mothers fast for their children's well-being, and the first day is known as "Nahaye-Khaye."
2.  The Jivitputrika festival's origins are rooted in the Hindu mythology of King Jimutavahana, who sacrificed his life for the welfare of others, and involves women performing a holy dip.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Jivitputrika (Jitiya) festival is indeed a three-day Hindu festival where mothers fast for their children's well-being, and the first day is called "Nahaye-Khaye," its primary observance is not confined to West Bengal.  It's predominantly celebrated in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Nepal.  The geographical scope stated is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The festival's roots are indeed found in Hindu mythology, specifically the story of King Jimutavahana. The practice of women taking a holy dip is also an integral part of the festival's rituals.  The connection to the mythological narrative and the ritualistic aspect of the holy dip are accurate.


**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on a report submitted by the Ministry of Culture, assessing the monument's national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" to categorize monuments that are no longer traceable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's decision to delist centrally protected monuments is indeed based on a report from the Ministry of Culture, which assesses whether the monument retains national importance.  The process involves evaluating the monument's historical significance and its current condition, considering factors such as its traceability and preservation needs.  If the assessment deems the monument no longer to be of national importance, delisting may proceed under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.  This highlights the government's role in managing and prioritizing the conservation of historical assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* contain a specific term "Missing Monuments." This term emerged later in reports by the CAG Audit team.  The Act focuses on the declaration of ancient and historical monuments or archaeological sites and remains as being of national importance or ceasing to be of such importance.  The absence of a formal definition for "Missing Monuments" in the Act itself indicates that the term is not a legally established category within the framework governing the protection of such sites.


**2. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand utilizes blockchain technology for complete traceability and certification of Indian cotton, ensuring 100% traceability from farm to gin.
2. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the sole implementing agency responsible for all aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, including branding, traceability, and certification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative indeed leverages blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of Indian cotton.  This technology allows for the tracking of the cotton's journey from the farm to the gin, enhancing transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain.  The aim is to establish a premium quality cotton brand with verifiable authenticity, boosting its global competitiveness and creating a sustainable ecosystem.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL plays a crucial role as the implementing agency, it's not the *sole* entity responsible. The initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, and various trade bodies and industry stakeholders.  TEXPROCIL's involvement is significant but doesn't encompass the entire operational and decision-making structure of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat program.  A collaborative approach is essential for effective implementation and achieving the program's objectives.


**3. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI, executed by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, aims to promote the democratization of art by creating public installations in urban landscapes across India.
2. The project exclusively features traditional Indian art forms, such as Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, and Alpana art, excluding contemporary styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project PARI's core objective is to democratize art by making it more accessible to the public through urban installations.  The project's execution by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art indicates a commitment to integrating art into public spaces, transforming urban landscapes into accessible galleries. The initiative aims to engage diverse artists and engage a wider audience with various art forms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Project PARI includes traditional Indian art forms like Thangka, Cheriyal, and Alpana painting, it is not limited to these styles.  The project aims to showcase a broader spectrum of artistic expressions, encompassing both traditional and contemporary styles from across India, promoting a diverse representation of artistic talents and perspectives.  The inclusion of contemporary works ensures the project is not confined to a narrow definition of Indian art.


**4. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative focuses solely on training women and youth to develop new tourism-related products and experiences, such as food tours and craft tours, neglecting other demographics.
2. The Ministry of Tourism launched the ‘Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi’ initiative across all 50 tourist destinations in India simultaneously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative places *special emphasis* on training women and youth, it does not *exclusively* focus on them. The program aims to elevate the overall tourist experience by training a broader range of individuals to act as ambassadors and storytellers for their destinations.  This inclusive approach ensures a more comprehensive and representative engagement with tourists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initiative aims to cover 50 tourist destinations, the launch was not simultaneous across all locations.  The phased rollout allows for targeted implementation and resource allocation, adapting to the specific needs and contexts of each destination. A simultaneous launch across all 50 locations would be logistically challenging and may compromise the program's effectiveness.


**5. With reference to the new flag, insignia, and Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The depiction of Lady Justice with a blindfold originated in Greek mythology, symbolizing impartiality from the earliest representations.
2. The new Lady Justice statue unveiled at the Supreme Court maintains the traditional depiction, including the scales and sword, but omits the blindfold.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the origins of the Lady Justice figure are rooted in Greek and Roman mythology, the addition of the blindfold is a later development. It was not a part of the earliest representations. The blindfold was added during the Renaissance period (14th century) as a symbol of impartiality, initially as a satire on corrupt legal systems, and later reinterpreted during the Enlightenment as a representation of unbiased judgment.

Statement 2 is likely correct (assuming the information about the new statue is accurate). The passage indicates the unveiling of a new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court.  While the traditional elements (scales and sword) are mentioned, the text does not explicitly state whether the blindfold is included in the new statue's depiction.  The omission of the blindfold in the new statue would be a significant deviation from the commonly understood symbolism of Lady Justice.  However, without a clear visual confirmation, we can't confirm this with absolute certainty.  Further information would be needed to verify this fact.



**6. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is located near the ancient Nalanda ruins and was established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010.
2. The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, primarily focused on religious studies, excluding disciplines like medicine, astronomy, or politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The establishment of the new Nalanda University campus near the ancient ruins and its foundation under the Nalanda University Act, 2010, are accurately described in the provided text. This reflects the efforts to revive a historical center of learning and its significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University's curriculum was far more comprehensive than solely religious studies.  While religious studies (Vedas, Buddhism) were central, the university also offered instruction in a wide range of disciplines, including medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy.  The breadth of subjects offered underscores the institution's role as a significant center of intellectual activity in its time.


**7. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire, at its zenith under the Tuluva Dynasty, extended its influence across the entire Indian subcontinent.
2. The Amaranayakas, military commanders under the Raya, collected taxes and retained a portion of the revenue for personal use and the maintenance of temples and irrigation works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Vijayanagara Empire was powerful and vast, its influence did *not* extend across the entire Indian subcontinent. Its reach was primarily concentrated in southern India, with significant expansions during the reign of Krishnadevaraya.  The empire's territorial limits did not encompass the entire subcontinent.

Statement 2 is correct. The Amaranayaka system was a key feature of Vijayanagara administration. Military commanders were granted territories to govern, collecting taxes and retaining a share of the revenue.  A portion of this revenue was indeed allocated to personal use, but also contributed to the maintenance of temples and irrigation systems, highlighting the integration of military administration with religious and economic aspects of governance.


**8. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahilyabai Holkar's reign witnessed the flourishing of the Maheswari weaving industry, leading to the registration of Maheswar “Sarees & Fabric” as a Geographical Indication (GI) product.
2.  The Holkar Dynasty was not part of the Maratha Confederacy, maintaining its independence throughout its existence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign was indeed marked by the promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry, leading to its recognition as a GI product.  This reflects her focus on economic development and her patronage of traditional crafts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Holkar Dynasty was, in fact, a prominent member of the Maratha Confederacy.  The Maratha Confederacy comprised several powerful Maratha states, and the Holkars played a significant role within this political alliance.  Their involvement in the Third Anglo-Maratha War further underscores their position within the broader Maratha political landscape.


**9. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, born in a Brahmin family in Murbad, Thane district, Maharashtra, was a key figure in the planning and development of Mumbai's infrastructure, particularly its buildings, streets, and avenues.
2.  Shankarseth's philanthropic work primarily focused on establishing educational institutions for boys, neglecting the education of girls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's significant contributions to Mumbai's urban development are well-documented. His role in planning and shaping the city's infrastructure, including buildings, streets, and avenues, is a testament to his vision and impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the text mentions his patronage of education, it explicitly highlights his emphasis on education for *girls*.  His philanthropic endeavors extended beyond boys' education, demonstrating a commitment to gender equality in access to education, a progressive stance for his time.


**10. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization's writing system, which is pictographic and written in boustrophedon style, has been fully deciphered, revealing its complex grammar and vocabulary.
2.  Evidence of both internal and external trade in the Indus Valley Civilization is found in standardized weights and measures and in records from Mesopotamia that mention the Indus region as Meluha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Indus Valley Civilization's script is pictographic and written in boustrophedon style, it has *not* been fully deciphered.  The meaning and structure of the script remain a subject of ongoing research and scholarly debate.  The lack of a complete decipherment prevents a definitive understanding of its grammar and vocabulary.

Statement 2 is correct.  The existence of standardized weights and measures, along with Mesopotamian records referring to the Indus region as Meluha and mentioning trade routes, strongly supports the presence of both internal and external trade networks within the Indus Valley Civilization.  These findings illustrate the advanced economic and organizational capabilities of this ancient civilization.


**11. With reference to Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization, is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat and is famous for its well-preserved dockyard.
2. The National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal is being developed solely by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, without any involvement of private entities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lothal's location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat, its status as a significant Indus Valley Civilization site, and the presence of the ancient dry-dock are all accurately described.  This highlights Lothal's importance in understanding the maritime capabilities of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The development of the NMHC at Lothal is being undertaken under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.  This collaborative approach involves both the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways and private sector participation.  The PPP model aims to leverage the strengths of both public and private sectors for efficient and effective project implementation.


**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance, allowing for regular construction and urbanization in the area.
2.  The AMASR Act formally defines and addresses the issue of "Missing Monuments," providing a framework for their retrieval and protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed empowers the Central Government to delist centrally protected monuments if they are assessed as no longer being of national importance.  This delisting removes the protection afforded under the Act, opening the way for construction and other activities in the area.  The delisting process itself is subject to procedures and assessments conducted by relevant authorities.  The power to delist reflects a pragmatic approach to managing the conservation of a large number of monuments, prioritizing those considered to hold the most significant historical or archaeological value.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" does not appear in the AMASR Act itself.  This term emerged later, likely in discussions related to audits or assessments of the protected monuments. The Act primarily focuses on the declaration, protection, and preservation of identified ancient monuments and archaeological sites; it does not have a specific provision directly addressing "missing" monuments as a defined category.  The handling of situations where monuments are lost or untraceable would typically fall under broader provisions within the Act or related regulations.


**2. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nalanda University Act of 2010 established the university near the ancient Nalanda ruins, fulfilling a commitment made at the 1st East Asia Summit.
2.  The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, was a monastic university with a vast library known as "Dharma Gunj," housing over ten million books.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Nalanda University Act of 2010 did establish the modern Nalanda University near the ancient ruins, the commitment to its establishment was made at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines in 2007, not the 1st.  The decision to revive Nalanda University as a modern institution was a significant event in promoting educational and cultural exchange in the region.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The ancient Nalanda University was indeed a monastic university founded in the 5th century CE. Its library, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," was legendary for its vast collection of books. The number of books is often cited as over nine million,  though the precise figure remains debated due to the nature of the historical sources and the destruction of the university.  The scale of the library, however, underscores Nalanda's importance as a major center of learning.


**3. With reference to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GST Council is a statutory body established under Article 279 of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Council's recommendations on GST-related matters, including tax rates and thresholds, require unanimous consent from all member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GST Council is a constitutional body, established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution (through the 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016), not Article 279.  The constitutional basis highlights the importance given to the Council in shaping India's indirect tax system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GST Council aims for consensus, its decisions do not require unanimous consent from all member states.  Decisions are typically made with a majority vote, reflecting the federal nature of the Indian political system.  The process of decision-making within the Council involves negotiations and discussions among representatives of the central and state governments.


**4. With reference to the White Revolution in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The White Revolution, also known as Operation Flood, was launched in 1970 with the primary objective of increasing the production of milk and reducing the country’s reliance on milk imports.
2.  The top five milk-producing states in India, together, contribute over 60% of the total milk production in the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The White Revolution, also known as Operation Flood, was a landmark dairy development program launched in 1970 by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).  Its main goal was indeed to significantly increase milk production and reduce India's dependence on milk imports. The program was instrumental in transforming India into the world's largest milk producer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the top five milk-producing states in India account for a substantial portion of the total milk production, their combined contribution is closer to 53.11%, not over 60%.  The variation in milk production across different states reflects factors such as climate, livestock practices, and government support for the dairy sector.  The accurate figure highlights the importance of regional variations within India's overall milk production.


**5.  With reference to the  National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), consider the following statements:**

1. The interest rate on Small Savings Instruments (SSIs) is reset by the central government at the beginning of each financial year.
2.  The NSSF comprises instruments such as the National Savings Certificate (NSC), Public Provident Fund (PPF), and Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP), but excludes the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The interest rates on Small Savings Instruments (SSIs) are reset by the central government at the beginning of every quarter, not at the beginning of each financial year. This quarterly revision reflects the government's response to changing economic conditions and interest rate scenarios.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana is included in the NSSF, along with the NSC, PPF, and KVP.  The NSSF is a consolidated fund that encompasses various small savings schemes, designed to encourage savings and channel funds for government developmental activities.  The inclusion of the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana demonstrates the government's commitment to providing diverse savings options for citizens.


**6. With reference to  Precision Farming (PF), consider the following statements:**

1. Precision farming primarily relies on traditional methods of observation and intuition for managing crops and soil, without utilizing modern technologies.
2.  The approach of precision farming involves site-specific management of inputs to optimize crop health and productivity while minimizing waste.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While precision farming does incorporate traditional knowledge, it fundamentally relies on modern technologies such as GPS, remote sensing, and variable rate technology ("hard" precision agriculture) for optimizing resource allocation and maximizing yields.  The integration of technology allows for more precise and efficient management of inputs, leading to better outcomes.

Statement 2 is correct.  Precision farming is characterized by its site-specific approach to managing inputs, tailoring the application of fertilizers, water, and pesticides to the specific needs of different areas within a field. This targeted approach minimizes waste, enhances resource efficiency, and improves the overall productivity and sustainability of farming practices.


**7. With reference to the  Kakori Train Robbery, consider the following statements:**

2.  The key figures involved in the Kakori Train action included Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqulla Khan, and Bhagat Singh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train action, which took place on August 9, 1925, was indeed a daring act of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) aimed at acquiring funds to support their revolutionary activities against British rule in India. The robbery was a significant event in the history of the Indian independence movement, showcasing the revolutionary fervor of the time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan were indeed key figures in the Kakori Conspiracy, Bhagat Singh was not directly involved in this particular event. Bhagat Singh's involvement in revolutionary activities came later, making his inclusion in this specific context inaccurate.  The distinction highlights the importance of understanding the specific timelines and individuals involved in different phases of the Indian freedom struggle.


**8. With reference to the  Swadeshi Movement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Swadeshi Movement primarily focused on boycotting foreign goods and promoting indigenous industries, but did not significantly impact the revival of traditional crafts.
2. The establishment of the National Council of Education was a direct outcome of the Swadeshi Movement, aiming to establish a system of education independent of colonial control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Swadeshi Movement played a crucial role in the revival of traditional crafts and industries.  A significant aspect of the movement involved encouraging the use of khadi cloth and supporting indigenous artisans, contributing to a broader economic and cultural revival.  The focus on self-reliance and the promotion of local products had a tangible impact on the revitalization of traditional crafts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The establishment of the National Council of Education was a direct outcome of the Swadeshi Movement.  The movement's emphasis on self-reliance extended to education, with the council aiming to provide an alternative to the colonial education system, promoting national identity and self-determination.  The council's creation signifies the movement's far-reaching influence on various aspects of Indian society.


**9. With reference to the  Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a significant anti-caste movement, primarily focused on securing access for all castes to the roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.
2.  The Vaikom Satyagraha led to immediate and complete implementation of temple entry for all castes across Travancore, resolving the issue of caste-based discrimination in temple access.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was a major anti-caste movement centered around securing access for all castes to the roads surrounding the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple in Travancore.  The movement's success in achieving partial access to the roads represented a significant step towards challenging caste-based restrictions and social inequalities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha did not result in the immediate and complete implementation of temple entry for all castes across Travancore. While the movement achieved partial success in opening certain roads, the complete removal of caste-based restrictions on temple entry took longer and involved subsequent legal reforms and social changes.  The partial nature of the immediate success highlights the complexities of social reform and the long struggle for social justice.


**10. With reference to the  Dharma Gunj, consider the following statements:**

1. Dharma Gunj was the name of the legendary library at the ancient Nalanda University, renowned for its vast collection of Buddhist scriptures and other literary works.
2.  The Dharma Gunj library was structured across nine floors, each housing an estimated one million books or manuscripts, covering a wide range of subjects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dharma Gunj, meaning "Mountain of Truth," was the name of the renowned library at the ancient Nalanda University. It was famed for its extensive collection of Buddhist scriptures, philosophical treatises, and other literary works, reflecting the university's status as a center of learning.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While the precise number of books in the Dharma Gunj is debated, historical accounts suggest a vast collection organized across multiple floors.  The description of nine floors and one million books per floor is a common interpretation, though the exact arrangement and the total number remain subject to scholarly discussion. The sheer scale of the library, however, remains a testament to the intellectual richness of Nalanda University.


**11. With reference to the  Ratna Bhandar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ratna Bhandar is the sacred treasury of the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, containing valuable jewels and other precious artifacts associated with the temple's deities.
2.  The Ratna Bhandar was reopened to the public after a closure of over 50 years, allowing for a comprehensive inventory and public viewing of its contents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ratna Bhandar is indeed the sacred treasury of the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha. It houses a vast collection of valuable jewels, precious metals, and other artifacts associated with the temple's deities – Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, and Devi Subhadra.  The treasury's significance stems from its religious and historical importance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ratna Bhandar was reopened after a long period of closure (46 years, not over 50), it was not opened for comprehensive public viewing of its contents.  Access remains restricted due to the sacred nature of the artifacts and the need to preserve them.  The reopening was primarily for inventory purposes and to address concerns about the treasury's security and preservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Project PARI is indeed a Ministry of Culture initiative executed by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. The project aims to integrate public art installations into urban landscapes, transforming public spaces into accessible art galleries. The initiative's focus on public art reflects a broader effort to promote art and culture.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Project PARI does showcase traditional Indian art forms,  its first intervention was primarily in Delhi, and it included art forms like Thangka painting (Sikkim/Ladakh), Cheriyal painting (Telangana), Bani Thani Painting (Rajasthan), and Alpana art (Tripura). The statement incorrectly mentions Madhubani painting and implies a broader geographic scope for the first intervention.  The focus on diverse art forms demonstrates the project's inclusivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja Chola did indeed conduct naval expeditions and engage militarily with Sri Lanka and the Maldives,  Sri Lanka's *northern* part was annexed, not the southern.  The extent of his influence over the Maldives also requires further nuance; it wasn't a complete conquest in the way Sri Lanka's northern region was.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's naval campaign against the Sailendra Empire was a major historical event, leading to the expansion of Chola power into Southeast Asia.  The conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra demonstrates the reach and power of the Chola navy.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The defining characteristic of Eri silk is that it's a *vegan* silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, unlike in the production of other silk types where the silkworm is killed.

Statement 2 is correct. Eri silk is indeed produced by the Philosamia ricini silkworm, which is multivoltine, meaning it produces several generations in a year. This characteristic allows for multiple harvests.  It's also commonly reared indoors, facilitating controlled production.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom dynasty was founded by Sukaphaa, it wasn't characterized by a centralized monarchy with absolute power in the king's hands.  The administration involved a powerful council of ministers (Patra Mantris), whose concurrence was necessary for key decisions, including the appointment of a king.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ahom dynasty had a significant cultural impact in Assam. They embraced Shaivism and the Shakti cult, patronizing the construction and rebuilding of numerous temples, including the Kamakhya Devi Temple.  Their cultural influence is evident in various aspects of Assamese society and architecture.


**14. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure featured the Amara-Nayakas, who were appointed as military commanders and granted territories to govern, but had no control over the collection of taxes and revenue from these territories.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire, with significant territorial expansion and notable literary contributions, including the work *Amuktamalyada*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas, while appointed as military commanders, did indeed have significant control over the territories they governed.  They collected taxes and retained a portion of the revenue for their personal use and for maintaining their armies, temples, and irrigation works.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign is widely considered the high point of the Vijayanagara Empire.  His rule saw considerable territorial expansion, and he was also a significant patron of the arts and literature. *Amuktamalyada* is one of his well-known works.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I, known for his aggressive military policies, launched a major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This significantly altered the political landscape of Southeast Asia and showcased the reach of Chola naval power.  Similarly, Rajendra I continued this expansionist policy, culminating in the complete subjugation of Sri Lanka and its incorporation as a Chola province. This achievement underscores the formidable naval strength and strategic prowess of the Chola Empire during this period.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the historical accuracy of both statements concerning the significant naval achievements of both rulers.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's administration, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amara-Nayakas system involved military commanders granted territories, collecting taxes, and retaining a portion for personal use while also contributing to temple and irrigation works.
2. The 'Ayagar' system consisted of twelve hereditary functionaries appointed by the government in each village to manage local affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key administrative features of the Vijayanagara Empire. The Amara-Nayaka system was a crucial element of their decentralized governance.  Military commanders, the Amara-Nayakas, were granted territories to govern, collecting taxes and retaining a share of the revenue.  However, this wasn't solely for personal enrichment; a portion was also dedicated to maintaining their military forces (elephants, horses), supporting temple upkeep, and financing irrigation projects. This demonstrates a system that balanced central authority with regional autonomy and contributed to infrastructure development. The Ayagar system, on the other hand, focused on village-level administration.  Twelve functionaries, collectively known as 'Ayagars,' were appointed by the government, and their positions became hereditary over time. This ensured continuity and local expertise in managing village affairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the validity of both described administrative systems within the Vijayanagara Empire.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate concerning the inclusion of Indian literary works in UNESCO's MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The MoW program, indeed launched in 1992, aims to preserve and promote significant documentary heritage.  The inclusion of manuscripts of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana reflects the importance of these works within Indian and global literary history.  The 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, played a pivotal role in formalizing this inclusion along with other works from the Asia-Pacific region.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't encompass the full accuracy of the statements regarding the MoW program's timeline and the role of the MOWCAP meeting in recognizing these Indian literary treasures.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a significant aspect of transhumance in India.  The Himalayan region, with its varying altitudes and climatic conditions, provides a suitable environment for this practice.  Nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas traditionally migrate with their herds of sheep and goats between subalpine and alpine pastures in summer and adjoining plains in winter.  This seasonal movement is integral to their livelihood and culture.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  While the Himalayas are a prominent region for transhumance, the practice also exists in various plains across India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  These regions exhibit different forms of seasonal livestock movement adapted to their specific geographical and climatic contexts.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the geographical extent of transhumance in India.

1.  Nalanda University, established in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, was destroyed in 1205 AD by Bakhtiyar Khalji.
2.  The university's curriculum included disciplines like Vedas, Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the ancient Nalanda University.  Its founding by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE and its eventual destruction in 1205 AD by Bakhtiyar Khalji are well-established historical facts.  The destruction marked a tragic end to a renowned center of learning.  The university's diverse curriculum encompassed a wide range of subjects, highlighting its intellectual breadth and its role as a significant center of learning across various disciplines.  The inclusion of Vedic studies alongside Buddhist traditions (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana) demonstrates its inclusive approach to knowledge.  The presence of subjects like medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy further underscores its comprehensive educational approach.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the historical accuracy of both statements about Nalanda's history and curriculum.

1. The earliest recorded instance of a navy is attributed to the Magadh kingdom during the age of the Nandas and Mauryas (500 – 200 BC).
2. The Satavahana dynasty (200 BC-220 AD) issued coins with inscriptions of ships, showcasing their maritime trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements represent accurate elements of ancient India's maritime history. The claim regarding the Magadh kingdom's navy during the Nanda and Maurya period is supported by historical records, establishing it as one of the earliest documented naval forces.  This highlights the significance of maritime power in ancient Indian politics and trade.  The Satavahana dynasty's practice of issuing coins with ship inscriptions further corroborates their engagement in maritime trade.  This numismatic evidence provides tangible proof of their maritime activities and their role in connecting India with other regions through sea routes.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the historical validity of both statements concerning the early development of naval power and the evidence of maritime trade in ancient India.


**7. With reference to the  Archaeological sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh contain some of the earliest examples of prehistoric rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period.
2. Neolithic-Chalcolithic period rock paintings in the Chambal region primarily depict humans in naturalistic style and animals in a stylistic manner, showcasing a shift in artistic representation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bhimbetka rock shelters are renowned for their prehistoric rock paintings, which include some of the earliest examples in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period. These paintings showcase early artistic expressions and provide insights into the lives of prehistoric communities.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  The description of Neolithic-Chalcolithic period paintings in the Chambal region is reversed.  In fact, during this period, animals were typically depicted in a more naturalistic style while human figures were often rendered in a more stylized manner. This reflects a change in artistic conventions and the changing focus of artistic expression. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2 regarding the artistic styles of the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period.


**8. With reference to the  Megalithic sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ooragutta in Telangana is an Iron Age megalithic site characterized by the presence of dolmenoid cists, which are semi-subterranean chamber tombs.
2.  The megalithic monuments in the Devarlabanda Mula site in Telangana are unique in that they solely depict animals, with no human or weapon representations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe specific features of megalithic sites in Telangana. Ooragutta's classification as an Iron Age megalithic site with dolmenoid cists (semi-subterranean chamber tombs) is consistent with archaeological findings in the region.  The presence of dolmenoid cists is a common feature of megalithic burial practices.  The unique characteristic of the Devarlabanda Mula site, where only animal depictions are found without human or weapon representations, sets it apart from other megalithic sites. This unique artistic style provides valuable insights into the beliefs and practices of the communities who created these monuments.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the validity of both statements concerning the specific characteristics of these megalithic sites.


**9. With reference to Buddhist sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bavikonda monastery near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, is a Theravada Buddhist complex dating back to the 3rd century BCE, featuring structures like a Mahastupa and Chaitya Griha.
2.  The Phanigiri site in Telangana, dating back to the Ikshvaku period, unearthed a coin hoard and showcases evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects coexisting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly identify and describe significant Buddhist sites in India.  The description of the Bavikonda monastery's features (dating, sect, structures) aligns with archaeological findings. Its identification as a Theravada Buddhist complex with structures like a Mahastupa and Chaitya Griha accurately reflects its significance as a well-preserved example of early Buddhist architecture.  Similarly, the information about the Phanigiri site in Telangana, including the discovery of a coin hoard and the evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects coexisting, is accurate based on archaeological excavations. The coexistence of different Buddhist sects at Phanigiri is a valuable insight into the religious landscape of the region during the Ikshvaku period. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to appreciate the historical accuracy of both statements about these important Buddhist sites.


**1. With reference to the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The statue depicts Lady Justice in traditional Indian attire, replacing the Western attire seen in previous depictions.
2. The blindfold has been removed, symbolizing that justice is not blind but actively seeks knowledge and understanding of societal complexities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India indeed reflects a significant departure from its colonial-era predecessor. Statement 1 is correct as the statue now portrays Lady Justice in a saree, aligning with Indian traditions and signifying a move away from Western symbolism.  This is a clear representation of decoloniality, aiming to shed colonial symbols and embrace indigenous cultural representation within the Indian judicial system.  Statement 2 is also correct. The removal of the blindfold is a powerful symbolic act.  It signifies a shift from the traditional notion of blind justice to one that acknowledges the complexities and nuances within society.  The open eyes represent a more active and discerning approach to justice, implying that the law is not oblivious to societal inequalities and differences but actively seeks to understand and address them.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the symbolism incorporated into the new statue.


**2. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1.  The movement primarily focused on securing the right to education for marginalized communities in Travancore.
2.  K. Kelappan, also known as the "Kerala Gandhi," played a significant role in leading the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Vaikom Satyagraha was a pivotal moment in the struggle against caste discrimination in Travancore. While education was undoubtedly a concern for the marginalized communities involved, the core issue of the Satyagraha was the denial of temple entry to members of lower castes.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Statement 2, however, is accurate. K. Kelappan, a prominent figure in the Indian independence movement and known as the "Kerala Gandhi," was indeed one of the key leaders of the Vaikom Satyagraha. He played a crucial role in mobilizing support for the movement and leading the non-violent protests against the discriminatory practices. His participation is well-documented and his leadership was instrumental in bringing the issue to national attention. Hence, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The university's library, known as "Dharma Gunj," housed over nine million books across nine floors, making it one of the largest libraries in ancient history.
2.  The university's curriculum exclusively focused on religious studies, particularly Buddhism and related philosophical traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nalanda University's reputation as a center of learning extended far beyond its religious studies.  Statement 1 is largely accurate. The "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth" was indeed a vast and renowned library, though the exact number of books is debated among scholars.  Ancient texts suggest a huge collection spanning various subjects.  The description of nine floors and millions of books is a testament to its scale and importance.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  While Nalanda was a significant center for Buddhist studies, its curriculum was far more diverse.  It covered a wide range of subjects, including Vedas, medicine, astronomy, politics, and even war strategy.  The university attracted scholars from various backgrounds and disciplines, contributing to its cosmopolitan nature and academic breadth.  Therefore, only statement 1 reflects a generally accepted aspect of the university.


**4. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that are deemed to have ceased to be of national importance.
2. The Act defines the term "missing monuments" and provides specific procedures for handling such cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The AMASR Act, 1958, is the primary legal framework for the protection and preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites in India. Statement 1 is correct. Section 35 of the AMASR Act explicitly empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance.  This provision allows for a review of the status of protected monuments and enables the removal of those that no longer meet the criteria for national significance. This is a crucial aspect of the Act's regulatory function.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act does not formally define the term "missing monuments." This term seems to have originated from reports by auditing teams and is not a legally defined category within the Act.  The Act primarily focuses on the protection and preservation of known and documented monuments, not on addressing the issue of unidentified or "missing" ones.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a provision of the AMASR Act.


**5. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases where the individual's contributions are deemed extraordinarily significant.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Bhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Padma Awards are among India's highest civilian honors. Statement 1 is correct. While the Padma Awards are generally not conferred posthumously, the government does make exceptions in highly deserving cases where the individual's contributions are of exceptional national importance. This reflects a degree of flexibility in the application of the rules governing the awards.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The order of precedence of the Padma Awards is as follows: Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), Padma Bhushan (for distinguished service of a high order), and Padma Shri (for distinguished service). The descriptions of the awards in statement 2 are reversed.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the practice of posthumous conferral of the Padma Awards.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangama dynasty marked the empire's zenith, reaching its greatest territorial extent under its rule.
2. The Amara-Nayakas were appointed military commanders who governed territories granted to them by the Raya (king), collecting taxes and retaining a portion of the revenue for their personal use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara Empire was a significant power in South India. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire reached its zenith under the Tuluva dynasty, not the Sangama dynasty. The Tuluva rulers expanded the empire's territory considerably and consolidated its power. The Sangama dynasty was the founding dynasty, but the empire's peak was under a later dynasty.  Statement 2, however, is accurate. The Amara-Nayakas were indeed military commanders who were granted territories to rule by the Raya (king). They collected taxes and retained a portion of the revenue for their personal use and expenses, including maintaining their armies, temples, and irrigation works. This decentralized system of governance was a key feature of the Vijayanagara administration.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly describes an aspect of the Vijayanagara Empire.


**7. With reference to the geographical locations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ten Degree Channel separates the Andaman Islands from the Nicobar Islands.
2. Port Blair, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is located in the North Andaman.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are an archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. Statement 1 is correct. The Ten Degree Channel is a significant waterway that separates the Andaman Islands from the Nicobar Islands. This channel is a crucial geographical feature defining the two main island groups of the archipelago.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Port Blair, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, is located in South Andaman, not North Andaman. This is a straightforward geographical fact about the location of the administrative center of the islands.  Therefore, only statement 1 is geographically accurate.


**8. With reference to the  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and its functions, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI is empowered to declare any ancient monument or archaeological site as a site of national importance, irrespective of its location.
2. The National Monuments Authority (NMA) under the Ministry of Culture grants permissions for construction in prohibited or regulated areas near centrally protected monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) plays a crucial role in preserving India's cultural heritage. Statement 1 is correct. The ASI, under the AMASR Act, 1958, holds the authority to declare ancient monuments and archaeological sites as being of national importance.  This power extends across the country, enabling the ASI to identify and protect significant sites regardless of their location within India. Statement 2 is also correct. The National Monuments Authority (NMA), established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, indeed has the responsibility of managing prohibited and regulated areas around centrally protected monuments.  A key function of the NMA is to grant permissions for construction in these sensitive zones, ensuring that new development does not compromise the preservation of the protected monuments.  Thus, both statements accurately reflect the roles and powers of the ASI and the NMA.


**9. With reference to the  Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI functions under the Ministry of Home Affairs and is subject to the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
2.  A state government's consent is required for the CBI to investigate a case within that state's jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is India's premier investigating agency. Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI actually functions under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Furthermore, the CBI is exempted from the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, although there are ongoing debates and legal challenges regarding this exemption.  Statement 2, however, is correct.  The CBI's powers are governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946. This Act mandates that the CBI needs the consent of the concerned state government before initiating an investigation within that state's jurisdiction. This consent can be general or case-specific.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of the CBI's operational framework.


**10. With reference to the  Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1. GI tags are granted by the Geographical Indications Registry in Mumbai.
2.  GI tags protect the unique identity and quality of products linked to a specific geographical location.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Geographical Indications (GI) tags are an important mechanism for protecting the unique identity and quality of products. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Registry responsible for granting GI tags in India is located in Chennai, not Mumbai. This is a crucial detail regarding the administrative body responsible for this intellectual property right.  Statement 2, however, is correct.  The core purpose of GI tags is to safeguard the unique characteristics and reputation of products that are intrinsically linked to a specific geographical origin.  This protection prevents others from misrepresenting the origin of their products and helps maintain the quality and integrity associated with the specific geographical location.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the purpose and function of GI tags.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval conquests extended to Sri Lanka, resulting in the annexation of its northern part, and also included a campaign against the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra I's naval expeditions reached the Sailendra Empire, encompassing the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, leading to the conquest of several regions in these areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime expansion under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval power, leading to successful campaigns against the Chera navy and conquests in Sri Lanka (annexing the northern part) and the Maldives.  These actions showcased the Chola's naval dominance in the Bay of Bengal and their ability to project power across maritime boundaries.  This expansion directly contributed to the flourishing trade networks that the Cholas controlled.

Rajendra I, the successor to Rajaraja I, continued and even surpassed his father's naval achievements. His expeditions reached far beyond the immediate Indian Ocean region, extending to the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia.  The conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra demonstrates the reach and strength of the Chola navy, signifying a significant moment in Indian maritime history and cultural influence in Southeast Asia. The scale of these expeditions highlights the advanced shipbuilding techniques and naval strategies employed by the Cholas.  Therefore, the combined achievements of Rajaraja I and Rajendra I underscore the Chola Empire's remarkable naval capabilities and its expansionist maritime policies.


**2. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Tuluva Dynasty oversaw the empire's greatest territorial expansion, while the Aravidu Dynasty was marked by internal conflicts and external pressures that ultimately contributed to the empire's decline.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur Doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and significant military victories against the Sultan of Bijapur, solidifying the empire's power and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's history. The Tuluva Dynasty is widely recognized as the period during which the Vijayanagara Empire reached its zenith in terms of territorial extent and political power.  This period witnessed significant military successes and administrative consolidation.  Conversely, the Aravidu Dynasty, the final ruling dynasty, was plagued by internal strife, succession disputes, and increasing pressure from the Deccan Sultanates, ultimately leading to the weakening and eventual fall of the empire.  This contrast between the Tuluva and Aravidu periods highlights the cyclical nature of imperial power and the factors that can contribute to both growth and decline.

Krishnadevaraya's reign is considered a golden age within the Tuluva Dynasty. His military campaigns resulted in the significant territorial gains mentioned in statement 2. The acquisition of the Raichur Doab, the strategically important region between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers, expanded Vijayanagara's control over crucial agricultural lands and trade routes.  His successes against Orissa and the Bijapur Sultanate further solidified the empire's dominance in the region, demonstrating his military prowess and strategic acumen.  His reign exemplifies the peak of Vijayanagara's military and political power during the Tuluva Dynasty.


**3. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance, a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement, involves the migration of human communities alongside their herds, adapting to the availability of pasturelands throughout the year.
2.  In India, this practice is prevalent in the Himalayan regions, with nomadic tribes like the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas migrating seasonally with their sheep and goats between subalpine/alpine pastures in summer and adjoining plains in winter, and also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe transhumance. Statement 1 provides a precise definition of transhumance, correctly emphasizing the seasonal movement of both livestock and the human communities that depend on them for sustenance. This practice is a crucial adaptation to varying environmental conditions, particularly in regions with distinct seasonal variations in pasture availability.  The definition highlights the interconnectedness of human livelihood and pastoralism within transhumance systems.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the geographical distribution of transhumance in India.  It accurately names specific nomadic tribes in the Himalayas who practice transhumance, highlighting the importance of this practice for their unique cultural and economic systems.  The mention of plains regions like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh broadens the understanding of transhumance beyond the commonly perceived Himalayan context, underscoring its wider prevalence across diverse geographical areas in India. This demonstrates the adaptability of the transhumance system to various ecological settings.


**4. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, alongside 17 other works from the Asia-Pacific region.
2.  The decision to include these works was made during the 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect facts about the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register. Statement 1 correctly identifies the inclusion of three specific Indian literary works—Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana—within the broader context of the regional register.  This highlights the recognition of these works as significant contributions to world literature and cultural heritage.  The inclusion of these works alongside other Asian and Pacific works emphasizes the shared cultural heritage and the global significance of preserving these documents.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the location and context of the decision to include these works on the register.  The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, serves as the official venue for the decision-making process, adding credibility and authority to the inclusion of the Indian and other works.  This detail underscores the international collaboration and recognition involved in preserving world memory.  The mention of the specific meeting location and committee provides a precise historical context for the inclusion of these literary works.


**5. With reference to the  prehistoric rock paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Upper Paleolithic period in India is characterized by earliest paintings, primarily linear representations in green and dark red, depicting animal figures (bison, elephants, tigers) and stick-like human figures, with sites such as Bhimbetka (Madhya Pradesh) and Jwalapuram (Andhra Pradesh) showcasing these early forms of rock art.
2. The Mesolithic period showcases the largest number of paintings, predominantly human scenes depicting hunting, community dances, and animals painted naturalistically while humans are depicted stylistically, with sites like Pachmarhi and Adamgarh Hills (Madhya Pradesh) being prominent examples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe characteristics of prehistoric rock paintings found in India.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Upper Paleolithic period as the source of the earliest known rock paintings in India.  It accurately describes the style of these paintings—linear representations in limited color palettes—and provides specific examples of sites where these paintings have been discovered: Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh and Jwalapuram in Andhra Pradesh. These sites are significant archeological locations known for their rich collection of prehistoric rock art, providing crucial insights into the artistic expressions of early human populations.

Statement 2 correctly highlights the Mesolithic period as the period with the largest number of rock paintings.  It accurately characterizes the subject matter of these paintings—predominantly human activities like hunting and communal dances—and describes the artistic style, emphasizing the naturalistic depiction of animals in contrast to the more stylized representation of human figures.  The mention of Pachmarhi and Adamgarh Hills in Madhya Pradesh, again, points to significant sites where these Mesolithic paintings are found, reinforcing the understanding of the artistic and cultural practices of the time period.  The comparison of artistic styles between animals and humans adds depth to the analysis of these prehistoric artistic expressions.

1.  Vikramshila University, known for its prominence in Buddhist studies, had notable alumni such as Atisha Dipankara (who revived Buddhism in Tibet) and Vasubandhu.
2.  Nalanda, Odantapuri, and Ratnagiri were significant centers of Buddhist learning, with Ratnagiri rivaling Nalanda in its importance and particularly focusing on Mahayana and Tantrayana (Vajrayana) Buddhism, while Odantapuri, established in the 8th century by the Pala ruler Gopal I, attracted many Tibetan scholars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the historical significance of ancient Indian universities, particularly those associated with Buddhist studies. Statement 1 correctly identifies Vikramshila University as a prominent center of Buddhist learning and mentions two of its renowned alumni: Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu.  Atisha's role in reviving Buddhism in Tibet highlights the international reach and influence of Vikramshila, while Vasubandhu's contributions to Buddhist philosophy underscore the intellectual stature of the university.  The mention of specific individuals adds a personal dimension to the understanding of Vikramshila's academic excellence.

Statement 2 accurately identifies Nalanda, Odantapuri, and Ratnagiri as major centers of Buddhist learning.  The comparison of Ratnagiri to Nalanda in terms of its importance, along with its specialization in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, provides a nuanced understanding of the diversity of Buddhist thought within these universities.  The detail about Odantapuri's founding by Gopal I and its attraction of Tibetan scholars emphasizes its historical context and its role in the transmission of Buddhist knowledge across geographical boundaries.  The inclusion of these details adds depth to the understanding of the interconnectedness of these universities and their contribution to the spread of Buddhism.


**7. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and related sites, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) between the Mauryan Empire and Kalinga, resulted in the annexation of Kalinga by Emperor Ashoka, leading to his conversion to Buddhism.  Kalinga's territory encompassed modern-day Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh.
2.  Salihundam and Danthapuri are significant Buddhist sites in the region formerly known as Kalinga, while Tangamayyakonda and Rottavalasa villages showcase Jain heritage, highlighting the religious diversity of the region.  Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, built around the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela for Jain monks, are famous for the Hathigumpha inscription.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

It accurately states the outcome of the war—the annexation of Kalinga by Emperor Ashoka—and his subsequent conversion to Buddhism, a significant turning point in his reign and Indian history. The geographical extent of Kalinga, encompassing Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh, provides a crucial geographical context for understanding the historical events and the subsequent spread of Buddhism.

Statement 2 accurately points to the religious diversity of the region, highlighting the presence of both Buddhist and Jain sites.  The mention of Salihundam and Danthapuri as significant Buddhist sites, and Tangamayyakonda and Rottavalasa as Jain sites, underscores the coexistence of different religious traditions in this part of India. The inclusion of Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, along with the significance of the Hathigumpha inscription, adds another layer of historical and cultural importance. The inscription, carved in Brahmi script, offers valuable insights into the reign of King Kharavela and the cultural patronage extended to Jainism during his time.  The combination of religious sites and historical inscriptions provides a comprehensive picture of the cultural landscape of ancient Kalinga.


**8. With reference to the  Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

2.  The temple's architecture exemplifies the Kalinga style, a distinct substyle within the Nagara style, characterized by four main components: the Vimana or Deula (Garbhagriha), Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa, each with its unique architectural features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key features of the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri. Statement 1 accurately identifies the temple's deities—Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra—and mentions the recent reopening of its Ratna Bhandar, a significant event that highlights the temple's religious and historical importance. The Ratna Bhandar, containing precious jewels and artifacts, is a focal point of the temple's rich history and tradition.  The mention of the reopening after a long period adds contemporary relevance to the temple's significance.

Statement 2 correctly describes the temple's architectural style as Kalinga, a substyle of Nagara architecture.  It accurately lists the four main components of the temple's structure—Vimana or Deula (Garbhagriha), Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa—and briefly describes their functions.  This detail provides a structured understanding of the temple's architectural layout and its design features. The description of the architectural style and components provides a deeper appreciation for the temple's aesthetic and functional aspects, highlighting the temple's importance as an example of Kalinga architecture.  The combination of religious and architectural details presents a comprehensive understanding of the Shree Jagannath Temple.


**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist ancient monuments deemed no longer of national importance, allowing for regular construction in the area.
2.  The AMASR Act officially recognizes the category of "Missing Monuments," facilitating their systematic documentation and protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed empowers the Central Government to delist centrally protected monuments that are assessed as no longer being of national importance.  Section 35 of the Act provides the legal framework for this process.  Once delisted, these monuments lose their protected status under the ASI, opening the way for potential construction and development in the area. This is a crucial aspect of the Act, highlighting the dynamic nature of heritage preservation and the need for reassessment of a monument's significance over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not an official category within the AMASR Act itself. The term emerged from reports by the CAG audit team, reflecting a concern about the lack of information or inability to locate certain protected monuments. The Act primarily focuses on the preservation of existing known monuments and archaeological sites, not on a specific category of "missing" ones.  The absence of this specific category in the Act underscores the need for more robust documentation and tracking mechanisms to prevent monuments from becoming "untraceable."


**2. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University was established in the 12th century CE, coinciding with the peak of the Pala Empire's power and influence.
2. The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was directly influenced by the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ancient Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, not the 12th century. While it flourished for centuries, its peak period was prior to the 12th century, and it eventually declined and was destroyed.  The 12th century marks its decline, not its founding or peak.  Confusing the timeline of the university’s existence is a common misconception.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was indeed influenced by an East Asia Summit (EAS), but it was the 2nd EAS held in the Philippines in 2007, not the 1st. This detail highlights the importance of precise information when discussing the genesis of contemporary academic institutions and their connections to international initiatives. The discrepancy in the year demonstrates the need for careful attention to detail in understanding historical contexts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This directly addresses statement 1.  The initiative's success hinges on its ability to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.  Statement 2 is also correct as TEXPROCIL is explicitly identified as the implementing agency for this project.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, focuses on democratizing art through public installations in urban areas.  This directly aligns with the description in statement 1, which accurately describes the project's core objective.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the National Gallery of Modern Art is involved, Project PARI is a collaborative effort, also executed by the Lalit Kala Akademi.  The project involves a wide range of artists and art forms, aiming to make art more accessible to the public.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the executing agency or fail to acknowledge the accuracy of statement 1.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is a national responsible tourism initiative launched across 50 tourist destinations in India, not just ten.  The initiative aims to promote responsible and sustainable tourism practices across a wide range of locations.  Statement 2 is correct; the Ministry of Tourism is responsible for launching and overseeing this initiative.  Thus, only statement 2 accurately reflects the details of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scope of the initiative or fail to recognize the Ministry of Tourism's role.


**4. With reference to the contributions of Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, primarily focusing on educational initiatives.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Swami Vivekananda's establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 is a well-documented fact. While the mission engages in various social services, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges, its core function is not solely limited to education.  Therefore, statement 1, while not completely inaccurate, needs a nuanced understanding. Statement 2 is undeniably correct; his 1893 address at the Parliament of the World's Religions is historically significant for its impact on the global perception of Indian spirituality and philosophy. His speech was widely lauded and is a landmark moment in cross-cultural exchange.  Therefore, while statement 1 requires a more precise interpretation, statement 2 is entirely accurate. The best answer is (c) because both statements hold some truth, though one requires a more precise interpretation. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly assess the relative accuracy of the two statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President of India confers the Bharat Ratna, there is no formally constituted selection committee; the Prime Minister makes the recommendations to the President. There is no formal process of selection.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the award does not include a monetary grant; it is purely an honour.  The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, and the process for bestowing it is unique. Therefore, both statements present inaccurate information regarding the award's conferral process and its associated benefits. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent aspects of the Bharat Ratna.


**6. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty was a prominent member of the Maratha Confederacy, and Malhar Rao Holkar played a crucial role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Holkar Dynasty's position within the Maratha Confederacy and Malhar Rao Holkar II’s involvement in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.  His defeat in the Battle of Mahidpur led to the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly impacting the dynasty's relationship with the British. Statement 2 is also correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign was characterized by significant social reforms, including promoting women's education and opposing practices like Sati.  Her focus on economic development is evident in her promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry, establishing it as a key economic activity.  While she did engage in political and military matters, her legacy is largely defined by her social and economic contributions. Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of different aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's history. Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.


**7. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the Vaikom Satyagraha, it wasn't solely led by him; many other leaders and activists played significant roles.  Moreover, the Satyagraha did not result in complete access to the temple; only three out of four roads leading to the temple were opened to all castes. Statement 2 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha significantly contributed to the momentum for legal reforms in Travancore, culminating in the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, which granted access to temples for lower-caste individuals. This proclamation was a landmark achievement in social reform. Thus, only statement 2 presents an accurate account of the Vaikom Satyagraha's impact. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the leadership and outcome of the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori Train Action, orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), was indeed a daring attempt to rob a British treasury train to fund their revolutionary activities. The robbery was a key event in their struggle against British rule. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kakori Train Action occurred in 1925, not 1926. The precise date was August 9, 1925. This event was a significant act of defiance, but characterizing it as a singular turning point in the independence movement would be an oversimplification.  The independence movement involved numerous events and strategies. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the purpose and context of the Kakori Train Action. Options (b), (c), and (d) fail to accurately reflect the historical details of the event.


**9. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The university was established in the 6th century CE by Kumargupta I and flourished until the 13th century CE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While some sources might place the founding slightly earlier or later, the 5th or 6th century CE is generally accepted.  The university's decline and eventual destruction in the 12th or 13th century CE is also well-established historical fact. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nalanda was a significant center of Buddhist learning, its curriculum was remarkably diverse, encompassing a wide array of subjects.  Medicine, astronomy, logic, grammar, and even political science and military strategy were all taught at Nalanda.  Its reputation as a center of learning attracted students from across Asia.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides an accurate overview of the university's timeline. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect, misrepresenting the scope of the university's curriculum.


**10. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to introduce proselytization and actively worked to convert people to Hinduism.
2.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, strongly advocated for the revival of ancient Vedic traditions and practices, but opposed social reforms such as widow remarriage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arya Samaj, under Swami Dayanand Saraswati's leadership, was indeed a pioneering Hindu organization that actively engaged in proselytization, aiming to spread its interpretation of Hinduism.  This was a significant departure from the traditional approach of Hinduism.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Swami Dayanand Saraswati championed the return to Vedic principles, he also advocated for several social reforms, including widow remarriage, and actively opposed practices like child marriage and caste discrimination.  His interpretation of Vedic texts emphasized social justice and equality.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a distinctive aspect of the Arya Samaj. Options (b), (c), and (d) fail to accurately reflect Swami Dayanand Saraswati's views on social reform.


**11. With reference to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI is responsible for the protection and preservation of all ancient sites and monuments in India, including those declared as 'National Importance'.
2. The ASI's mandate includes regulating archaeological excavations and the protection of sculptures, carvings, and other artifacts, but not the management of prohibited areas near monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI is the primary agency responsible for the protection and preservation of nationally important archaeological sites and monuments in India. This includes sites declared as 'National Importance' under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The ASI's responsibilities extend to regulating archaeological excavations and protecting artifacts.  Furthermore, the National Monuments Authority (NMA), established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, works in tandem with ASI to manage prohibited and regulated areas around centrally protected monuments.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the ASI's broad mandate. Options (b), (c), and (d) fail to accurately capture the ASI's role and responsibilities.


**12. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization had a sophisticated urban planning system evident in cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, featuring standardized weights and measures, but lacked a centralized political structure.
2.  The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides evidence of their advanced maritime technology and extensive trade networks, primarily focused on the export of precious metals and gemstones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Indus Valley Civilization displayed remarkable urban planning skills, with cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa showcasing grid patterns, sophisticated drainage systems, and standardized weights and measures.  However, the nature of their political structure remains debated; evidence suggests a complex system that may not have been strictly centralized. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Lothal's dry dock demonstrates advanced maritime capabilities, their trade networks were more diverse than indicated.  Exports included grains, pottery, and textiles, not primarily precious metals and gemstones, which were often imported.  Therefore, while statement 1 requires a nuanced understanding of their political system, it correctly highlights their urban planning.  Only statement 1 is largely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization's trade and political structure.


**13. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MoW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains only one international register of significant documentary heritage.
2.  Manuscripts of Indian literary works, such as the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra, have been included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme, established in 1992, maintains three registers: international, regional, and national.  This allows for a tiered system of recognition for significant documentary heritage.  Statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of manuscripts of Indian literary works, including the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra, in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register is a well-documented event, reflecting their cultural significance.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the MoW Programme and its impact. Options (a), (c), and (d) fail to accurately reflect the structure of the MoW Programme or the recognition given to Indian literary works.


**14. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

2. Yoga's origins can be traced back to ancient India, with evidence suggesting its practice during the Indus Valley Civilization, but its systematic documentation is primarily found in Patanjali's Yogasutra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the UN did proclaim June 21st as IYD based on India's proposal, it wasn't endorsed by *all* member states; a record 175 member states endorsed it.  Statement 2 is correct.  Evidence from the Indus Valley Civilization suggests the practice of yoga-like postures, and while references exist in the Vedas, the systematic documentation of yoga is primarily attributed to Patanjali's Yogasutra.  Therefore, while statement 1 requires a minor correction, statement 2 accurately reflects the historical context of yoga.  Only statement 2 is entirely correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the UN's endorsement of IYD or the historical development of yoga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is indeed a premium quality Indian cotton brand that uses blockchain technology for complete traceability and certification.  This ensures the cotton's origin and quality are verifiable, enhancing its credibility and competitiveness in the international market. The 100% traceability aspect is a key feature designed to address concerns about cotton quality and sourcing in the global supply chain.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the designated implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative. TEXPROCIL's role involves coordinating the various aspects of the project, including production standards, branding, marketing, and export promotion.  This centralized approach streamlines the process and helps to ensure that the Kasturi Cotton brand maintains its high standards and achieves its objectives of boosting Indian cotton's global presence.


**2. With reference to Project PARI, consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, aims to transform urban landscapes into accessible art galleries by promoting public art installations across various cities in India, thereby fostering a more inclusive and engaging cultural environment.
2.  The project is executed solely by the Lalit Kala Akademi, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Culture, and involves the creation of diverse artworks, including paintings, murals, and sculptures, by artists from across India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core objectives of Project PARI. The initiative seeks to democratize art by bringing it into public spaces, making it more accessible to a wider audience.  The transformation of urban environments through public art installations is a central theme of the project, aiming to enrich the cultural experience of city dwellers and foster a sense of community engagement.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Lalit Kala Akademi is involved in the execution of Project PARI, it is not solely responsible. The National Gallery of Modern Art also plays a crucial role in the project's implementation.  The collaboration between these two institutions broadens the scope and expertise involved in the creation and curation of the public art installations.

1.  The Ministry of Tourism launched this initiative across 100 tourist destinations in India, aiming to enhance the overall tourist experience and promote responsible tourism practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative was launched across 50, not 100, tourist destinations in India.  While the aim is to improve the tourist experience and promote responsible tourism, the number of destinations covered is a key factual detail that makes this statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The initiative is not solely focused on training women. While it likely includes training women as part of its broader aim to promote responsible tourism, the statement's exclusive focus on women and gender equality is an oversimplification of the program's goals. The initiative likely encompasses a wider range of training and engagement programs.


**4. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1.  The museum, established in memory of the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, is located on the Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, near the Bhujio Fort, which was constructed in the 18th century.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

Statement 1 is correct. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum is indeed located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, close to the historically significant Bhujio Fort.  The location is significant in that it connects the museum's purpose of remembrance with the historical context of the region.  The 18th-century construction of the Bhujio Fort adds to the historical context.

Statement 2 is also correct. The museum does include one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests. This demonstrates a thoughtful integration of environmental sustainability into the memorial's design, symbolizing renewal and resilience in the wake of the devastating earthquake. The Miyawaki method itself is a noteworthy aspect, showcasing a specific approach to forest restoration.

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the award was instituted in 1969 to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary, the cash prize amount is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  This discrepancy in the monetary value makes the statement factually incorrect.

2. Rajendra I's conquest extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I was a powerful naval ruler, the provided text mentions the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  This subtle but significant difference makes the statement factually inaccurate. The Chola's naval power extended to the control of sea routes and trade, and conflict with various kingdoms, but the specific detail about the target kingdom is misleading.  The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of Chola naval history, and a slight inaccuracy invalidates the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Rajendra I launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the significant reach of Chola naval power and its impact on Southeast Asia. This fact is well-documented and reflects the expansive nature of Chola maritime dominance.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that three Indian literary works were included, but it also mentions that 17 *other* works from the region were also included.  This makes the statement that only these three Indian works were included false.  The question tests the candidate's ability to understand the scope of the register and not just focus on the examples given.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the decision to include the mentioned manuscripts was taken at the 10th meeting of the MOWCAP held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  This is a precise detail that requires accurate recall of the information.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the practice of transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes transhumance in the Himalayas, mentioning specific nomadic tribes (Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas) and the seasonal movement of their livestock.  This statement correctly identifies a key aspect of transhumance in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that this system also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The question attempts to mislead the candidate by creating a false impression of geographical limitation.  The candidate needs to know the broader geographical distribution of transhumance to answer correctly.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**4. With reference to the International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, coinciding with the Winter Solstice.
2. The draft resolution proposing IYD was initiated by India and received support from over 170 member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that June 21st was proclaimed as IYD and that this date coincides with the *Summer* Solstice, not the Winter Solstice. This detail is crucial and demonstrates the need for precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately mentions that India proposed the draft resolution and that it received endorsement from a record 175 member states (a number slightly higher than the statement suggests, indicating the overwhelming support).

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ooragutta is correctly identified as an Iron Age megalithic site, the text does *not* state that it contains rock art depicting humans and weapons.  This is a deliberate attempt to confuse the candidate by combining correct and incorrect information.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the rock art at Devarlabanda Mula as featuring only animals, without human or weapon representations.  This is a specific detail requiring precise knowledge.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly places the temple on the foothills of the Alagar hills in Madurai, but it states that the temple is dedicated to Lord *Vishnu* (worshipped as Kallazhagar), not Lord Shiva.  This is a key detail that differentiates the temple's religious significance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the pillars of the mandapam (hall) exhibit the Nayaka style of art. This is a specific architectural detail requiring accurate recall.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

The text states that the complex dates back to prehistoric times and shows evidence of human habitation from the Iron Age, along with artifacts from various dynasties including Satavahana, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara, indicating a much longer and more diverse history than just the Gupta period.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions a rock inscription by King Mayurasharma of the Kadamba dynasty from AD 450, highlighting the historical significance of the site.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE resulted in the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire and the subsequent conversion of Emperor Ashoka to Jainism.
2. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is renowned for his patronage of Jainism and the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War did lead to the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire, but Emperor Ashoka converted to *Buddhism*, not Jainism, as a result of the war's brutality. This is a crucial detail concerning Ashoka's religious transformation.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and his association with the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves are well-documented facts.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the location near Visakhapatnam is accurate, the monastery primarily represents *Theravada* (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana Buddhism.  This is a significant distinction in Buddhist sects.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explains the meaning of "Bavikonda" as "hill of wells" and its connection to the presence of ancient water storage systems.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did conduct significant naval expeditions and achieve considerable victories, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  This subtle difference is crucial for accurate recall. The Pandya and Chera were distinct South Indian kingdoms, often rivals to the Cholas. Confusing the two demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge of Chola history.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly details Rajendra I's major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This showcases Rajendra I's expansionist ambitions and the reach of Chola naval power beyond the immediate Indian subcontinent.  The successful conquest of these geographically distant regions highlights the sophistication of Chola naval capabilities and their strategic influence in Southeast Asia.


**2. With reference to Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The practice is primarily confined to the Himalayan region, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis.
2.  Transhumance in the plains is limited to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, due to the arid nature of these regions.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas and involves the tribes mentioned, the text also explicitly states that this system exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  Restricting the practice solely to the Himalayan region overlooks a significant aspect of its geographical distribution across India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly mentions the presence of transhumance in the plains of several states beyond Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, including Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. This demonstrates a broader understanding of the practice and its adaptability to different geographical and ecological contexts in India.  Focusing only on Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh ignores the wider presence of this traditional pastoral practice.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas, included in the register, is a 17th-century epic poem written in Sanskrit.
2. The Panchatantra, also featured, is known for its unique "story within a story" structure.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text correctly identifies the Ramcharitmanas as a 16th-century epic poem, but specifies that it is written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit. This highlights the importance of precise detail in recalling historical and literary information.  The language of a work is a key identifying feature, and mistaking Awadhi for Sanskrit demonstrates a lack of accurate knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Panchatantra's distinctive feature as the "story within a story" structure. This demonstrates an understanding of the work's unique narrative technique and its significance in Indian literature.  The description of this structural element clearly distinguishes the Panchatantra from other fable collections.


**4. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the Trayastrimsa heaven to Kusinara in Uttar Pradesh.
2.  The event coincides with the end of the first Rainy Retreat (Vassa) and the Pavarana festival.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IAD does commemorate Buddha's descent from a celestial realm, the text specifies that this was from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur), not Kusinara. Kusinara is significant as the place of Buddha's death (parinirvana), a completely different event.  Confusing these two locations shows a lack of understanding of key events in Buddhist history.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately states that IAD coincides with the end of the first Rainy Retreat (Vassa) and the Pavarana festival. This demonstrates an understanding of the Buddhist calendar and the significance of these events in the Buddhist monastic tradition.  The connection between IAD and the end of Vassa places it within a specific religious context.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text indicates that the CPA aims to curb illicit trafficking and facilitate the quick seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities. This demonstrates an understanding of the agreement's purpose in protecting cultural heritage and addressing the issue of stolen artifacts.  The focus on repatriation highlights the agreement's practical implications for recovering stolen cultural property.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the CPA deals with illicit trafficking, the text doesn't limit the scope to sculptures and paintings.  It refers to "archaeological material and ethnological material of Indian origin," which is a broader category encompassing a wider range of cultural artifacts. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the agreement's scope, focusing on specific art forms rather than the broader category of cultural property.


**6. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE resulted in the complete annihilation of the Kalinga army and the widespread destruction of Kalinga's infrastructure.
2. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga dynasty, is renowned for his patronage of Jainism and the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War was a significant event leading to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, the text doesn't state the complete annihilation of the Kalinga army or widespread destruction. The text only mentions the annexation of Kalinga by the Mauryan Empire. Overstating the consequences of the war shows a lack of nuanced understanding of historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately identifies Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and his association with the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, highlighting his cultural contributions.  The mention of the Hathigumpha inscription further solidifies Kharavela's importance in Kalinga history.  This demonstrates an accurate understanding of  Kharavela's reign and his legacy.

1. Ooragutta is a Neolithic site featuring rock art depicting human figures engaged in hunting and warfare.
2. The rock art at Devarlabanda Mula is unique in its exclusive depiction of animals, lacking representations of humans or weapons.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text identifies Ooragutta as an Iron Age megalithic site, not a Neolithic site.  Furthermore, it does not mention depictions of hunting or warfare.  Confusing the time period and the nature of artifacts shows a lack of precision in recalling archaeological details.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the rock art at Devarlabanda Mula as uniquely featuring only animals without human or weapon depictions.  This highlights the distinctiveness of this site compared to other rock art sites in the region.  The specific detail about the absence of humans and weapons is a key differentiating factor.


**8. With reference to the Phanigiri site in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. Phanigiri is a predominantly Hindu site known for its numerous temples dedicated to Vishnu and Shiva.
2. Excavations at Phanigiri have unearthed a coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period, alongside structures indicative of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Phanigiri is a historically significant site, the text clearly identifies it as a Buddhist site, mentioning the discovery of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, and viharas.  Describing it primarily as a Hindu site is a significant misrepresentation of its religious affiliation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately reports the discovery of an Ikshvaku period coin hoard and the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist structures, demonstrating an understanding of the site's archaeological significance and its religious diversity.  The mention of both Buddhist sects highlights the site's complex religious history.


**9. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. Located near Visakhapatnam, it is a significant example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture dating back to the 1st century CE.
2.  The monastery features a Mahastupa, Acharya Vihara, and Chaitya Griha, reflecting a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist complex.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly places Bavikonda near Visakhapatnam and mentions its structures, but dates it back to the 3rd century BCE, not the 1st century CE.  Furthermore, it identifies the complex as Theravada (Hinayana), not Mahayana.  The incorrect dating and sect show a lack of precise knowledge of the monastery's history.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the presence of a Mahastupa, Acharya Vihara, and Chaitya Griha within a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist context. This demonstrates an understanding of the monastery's architectural features and its religious affiliation.  The specific details of these structures are key to identifying the monastery's type and significance.


**10. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The delisting process is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, assessing the monuments' lack of national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act of 1958 defines "missing monuments" as those that cannot be traced after extensive searches by the ASI.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the decision to delist the 18 monuments was based on a Ministry of Culture report assessing their lack of national importance.  This demonstrates understanding of the procedure and criteria used for delisting centrally protected monuments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there is no term "missing monuments" in the AMASR Act. The term was used by the CAG audit team, not the act itself.  This highlights the importance of distinguishing between official terminology and informal usage.  The incorrect statement demonstrates a misunderstanding of the legal framework governing the protection of monuments.


**11. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangama Dynasty, the empire's founders, were succeeded by the Tuluva Dynasty, during whose reign the empire reached its zenith.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and significant victories against the Sultan of Bijapur.

2. A massive avalanche in recent times has significantly impacted Gandhi Sarovar and the surrounding area.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is not explicitly stated or implied in the text. While the text mentions the lake's original name as Kanti Sarovar, it doesn't comment on its natural origin or its existence prior to the temple.  Assuming the lake's natural origin without evidence is a misconception.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions a massive avalanche impacting Gandhi Sarovar and the surrounding area near Kedarnath Temple.  This demonstrates an understanding of recent events affecting the region and their impact on the natural environment.  The mention of the avalanche provides a specific context for assessing the statement's accuracy.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the museum is correctly located in Bhuj and dedicated to the 2001 earthquake victims, the magnitude is given as 7.9, not 8.0 in the text.  This minor difference in magnitude shows the importance of precise factual recall.  A seemingly insignificant numerical difference can invalidate a statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately mentions the presence of one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests at the museum, highlighting the integration of sustainable practices in the memorial's design.  This demonstrates an understanding of the museum's unique features and its commitment to environmental sustainability.


**14. With reference to the Chandravalli Cave Complex, consider the following statements:**

1. Situated in the Chitradurga district of Karnataka, the complex primarily showcases architectural features from the Gupta period.
2.  The cave complex contains a Shiva linga, suggesting its use as a place of worship, alongside rooms that might have served as living quarters for ascetics.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Chandravalli Cave Complex is in Chitradurga, the text mentions artifacts and inscriptions from various periods including Satavahana, Hoysala, Vijayanagara, Roman, and Chinese, but doesn't specifically highlight Gupta period architecture as primary.  Focusing on the Gupta period without sufficient evidence demonstrates a selective and potentially inaccurate interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately mentions the presence of a Shiva linga and rooms suitable for visitors and ascetics, supporting the interpretation of the complex as a place of worship and possibly a dwelling for religious practitioners.  The description of the chambers provides concrete evidence supporting the statement.


**15. With reference to the Classical Language status conferred by the Government of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali are among the languages recently granted Classical Language status.
2. The government's decision is solely based on the linguistic features and historical significance of the languages, without considering political or social factors.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text specifically mentions these five languages as having been granted Classical Language status. This demonstrates accurate recall of recent government decisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While linguistic features and historical significance are important, the text does not rule out other factors influencing the decision.  Assuming that political or social factors are entirely absent is an oversimplification and a potential misinterpretation of the complex decision-making process.  The statement lacks nuance and ignores the potential interplay of various factors.

They were constructed as shelters for Jain monks, reflecting the patronage of Jainism during that period.  The historical accuracy of the statement is well-established through archaeological findings and historical records.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Phanigiri site in Telangana has yielded a significant coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period. Archaeological excavations have unearthed various structures indicating a significant Buddhist presence, including a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, and viharas.  The presence of architectural elements associated with both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism suggests a period of religious coexistence at the site.  The discovery supports the understanding of the religious landscape of the region during the Ikshvaku period.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire and its maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast and did not extend beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrating their naval prowess.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I did consolidate Chola power along the Coromandel Coast, his naval expeditions extended beyond the Bay of Bengal.  He conducted successful campaigns against the Cheras and also invaded and annexed parts of Sri Lanka. This demonstrates a broader scope of his naval ambitions than the statement suggests.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's military campaigns were a landmark in Chola naval history. His expeditions against the Sailendra Empire led to the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion signifies the significant reach and power of the Chola navy, extending their influence far beyond the Indian subcontinent.  The evidence of these conquests is well-documented in historical sources.


**3. With reference to megalithic sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of semi-subterranean chamber tomb, are exclusively found in the southern regions of India, particularly in the Deccan Plateau.
2. Megalithic burials, characterized by the use of large stones, exclusively signify a practice solely associated with burial rituals and do not provide insights into other aspects of Neolithic-Chalcolithic life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While dolmenoid cists are prevalent in southern India, they are not exclusively confined to that region.  Similar burial structures have been found in other parts of the country, indicating a wider geographical distribution of this type of megalithic construction. The statement oversimplifies the geographical distribution of this type of burial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Megalithic burials, while primarily associated with funerary practices, offer valuable insights into various aspects of Neolithic-Chalcolithic life.  The grave goods found within these structures—pottery, tools, ornaments—provide crucial information about the material culture, social organization, and beliefs of the people who created them.  The statement ignores the rich contextual information provided by the artifacts associated with megalithic sites.


**4. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty and its cultural contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings held absolute power, with little influence from a council of ministers, reflecting a centralized and autocratic system of governance.
2. The Ahom Dynasty, despite its origins outside of India, significantly contributed to the religious landscape of Assam by patronizing Shaivism and the Shakti movement, exemplified by their rebuilding and patronage of the Kamakhya Devi temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Ahom kings were monarchs, their power was significantly constrained by a powerful council of ministers (Patra Mantris).  The king's authority was not absolute; major decisions required the council's concurrence. The statement misrepresents the nature of Ahom governance, which involved a complex interplay between the monarch and the ministerial council.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ahom Dynasty, despite its origins in present-day Myanmar, had a profound impact on the religious and cultural landscape of Assam. They adopted and patronized both Shaivism and the Shakti movement. Their rebuilding and patronage of the Kamakhya Devi temple stand as a testament to their contribution to the religious traditions of the region.  The statement accurately reflects the Ahom dynasty's cultural impact on Assam's religious landscape.


**5. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire and its administration, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's administration relied heavily on a decentralized system, with little central control exerted over the vast territories under its rule.
2. The Amara-Nayakas, powerful military commanders, were granted territories to govern but were also required to contribute a portion of the revenue to the imperial treasury and maintain military forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire, despite its vast size, maintained a relatively centralized administrative structure. While considerable autonomy was granted to regional governors (Amara-Nayakas), the emperor retained ultimate authority and control over key aspects of governance, including taxation and military affairs. The statement misrepresents the degree of centralization in Vijayanagara administration.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Amara-Nayakas were powerful military commanders who were granted territories to govern.  However, their autonomy was conditional.  They were responsible for collecting taxes from their assigned territories and remitting a share to the imperial treasury.  They also had to maintain a substantial military force, ready to serve the emperor when needed.  This system ensured both regional governance and central control.


**6. With reference to Buddhist universities in ancient India, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University, renowned for its extensive library and scholarly contributions, primarily focused on the study of Hinayana Buddhism and excluded Mahayana Buddhist texts.
2. Vikramshila University, established by Pala ruler Dharmapala, was a major center of learning, attracting scholars from across Asia, including Atisha Dipankara, who played a crucial role in reviving Buddhism in Tibet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University, while a significant center of Buddhist learning, was not exclusively focused on Hinayana Buddhism. It was a major center for both Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism, and its library housed a vast collection of texts representing diverse Buddhist schools of thought. The statement inaccurately restricts the scope of Nalanda's academic pursuits.

Statement 2 is correct. Vikramshila University, founded by Pala ruler Dharmapala, was indeed a prominent center of Buddhist learning. It attracted scholars from across Asia, playing a significant role in the intellectual and religious life of the region. Atisha Dipankara, a key figure in the revival of Buddhism in Tibet, was among its notable alumni.  The statement accurately reflects Vikramshila's importance and its association with Atisha Dipankara.


**7. With reference to the pre-historic rock paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, predominantly feature geometric patterns and abstract designs, with few representations of animals or human figures.
2. Mesolithic period rock paintings show a shift towards more naturalistic depictions of animals, while human figures are often depicted in a more stylized manner, reflecting a change in artistic conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While some early rock art may contain abstract elements, the earliest Indian rock paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period do include representations of animals and human figures, albeit often in a more linear or schematic style.  The statement understates the presence of figurative representations in the Upper Paleolithic rock art.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mesolithic rock paintings show a notable shift in artistic style.  Animals are often depicted in a more naturalistic manner, showing greater attention to detail and anatomical accuracy.  Human figures, in contrast, are frequently rendered in a more stylized fashion, using simplified forms and conventions. This reflects an evolution in artistic techniques and a possible shift in artistic focus.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the  cultural sites in Srikakulam:**

1. Srikakulam, historically known as Chicacole, has only Buddhist and Jain sites, reflecting a predominantly non-Hindu religious landscape during its early history.
2.  The Buddhist site of Salihundam in Srikakulam is historically significant for its role in the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asian countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Srikakulam has significant Buddhist and Jain sites, it is inaccurate to claim it had a *predominantly* non-Hindu religious landscape.  The region's history reveals a more complex religious tapestry, with various faiths coexisting and influencing one another over time.  Hindu temples and other religious structures are also present in the area. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the region's religious diversity.

Statement 2 is correct. Salihundam, a prominent Buddhist site in Srikakulam, is widely recognized for its role in the dissemination of Buddhism to Southeast Asia.  Historical evidence and accounts suggest its importance as a center of Buddhist learning and missionary activity, which contributed to the spread of Buddhism across the region. The statement accurately reflects the established historical significance of Salihundam.


**9. With reference to the  'City of Literature' designation by UNESCO, consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode (Calicut) is the only city in India to have received the UNESCO ‘City of Literature’ designation, highlighting its unique literary heritage.
2. Kozhikode’s historical significance as a major spice trading center played a negligible role in shaping its rich literary tradition.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kozhikode (Calicut) holds the distinction of being the first and, currently, the only city in India to receive the UNESCO ‘City of Literature’ designation. This recognition underscores its rich literary history, traditions, and contributions to literature. The statement accurately reflects the unique status of Kozhikode among Indian cities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kozhikode's historical significance as a major spice trading center profoundly influenced its literary tradition. The interactions with diverse cultures and the resulting exchange of ideas, knowledge, and stories contributed significantly to the city's literary development. The statement wrongly minimizes the crucial role of Kozhikode's trade history in shaping its literary landscape.  The city's cosmopolitan nature, stemming from its trade, fostered a vibrant literary environment.


**10. With reference to the Chandravalli Cave Complex in Karnataka, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chandravalli Cave Complex is exclusively associated with the Vijayanagara period and displays only architectural styles and artistic motifs characteristic of that era.
2. The presence of a Shiva linga within the cave complex indicates its importance as a place of worship, while other chambers suggest it may have also served as a monastic dwelling or educational center.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chandravalli Cave Complex exhibits a much longer history than just the Vijayanagara period.  Archaeological findings suggest its use from prehistoric times (Iron Age) through various historical periods, including the Satavahana, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara eras. The presence of artifacts from different periods indicates its continuous use over centuries, and the statement incorrectly restricts its historical context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The presence of a Shiva linga within the cave complex clearly demonstrates its use as a place of worship.  The existence of other chambers, such as those possibly used for visitors, sadhus, and potentially even a library, strongly suggests that it may have also served as a monastic residence or an educational center (Gurukul), reflecting its multi-faceted functionality. The statement accurately reflects the archaeological interpretation of the cave complex's use.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Rajaraja I's significant naval victory was against the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. The Pandyas were a rival kingdom, but this specific naval engagement is attributed to the Cheras.  This subtle difference in the name of the defeated kingdom makes this a challenging distractor for candidates who may have a general understanding of Chola naval power but lack precise details.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I, the successor of Rajaraja I, significantly expanded the Chola empire's reach through ambitious naval expeditions. His campaigns did indeed reach the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This illustrates the Chola's maritime dominance and their far-reaching influence in Southeast Asia.  The geographical extent of Rajendra I's conquests is a key element often tested in UPSC examinations.


**2. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem in Sanskrit, was included in the register.
2. The Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, a text on Indian poetics authored by Abhinavagupta, was among the inscribed works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the *Ramcharitmanas* was indeed included, it's crucial to note the correct century.  It was written in the 16th century by Goswami Tulsidas, not the 17th century. This minor chronological discrepancy serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the text's authorship and period.  The UPSC often emphasizes such details.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is a significant text on Indian poetics, it was authored by Acharya Anandavardhana, not Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta wrote a commentary on it, but the original authorship is key. This plays on the common association of both names with the text, creating a plausible but incorrect option.  The difference in authorship is a subtle detail that separates candidates with thorough knowledge from those with superficial understanding.


**3. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "missing monuments" as those that cannot be traced and are thus excluded from protection.
2. Section 35 of the AMASR Act outlines the procedure for delisting centrally protected monuments deemed no longer of national importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act does *not* formally define a category of "missing monuments."  The term emerged from CAG audit reports, highlighting the issue of untraceable monuments.  This distinction is crucial, as it tests the candidate's understanding of the legal framework versus informal terminology used in discussions surrounding the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, indeed provides the legal basis for delisting centrally protected monuments that are assessed as no longer being of national importance.  The process and criteria for delisting are important aspects of the Act, frequently relevant in discussions of heritage preservation in India.  This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the specific legal provisions.


**4. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when the Buddha delivered his first sermon at Sarnath.
2. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankisa marks the location where the Buddha descended from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Buddha's first sermon, the Dharmachakra Pravartana, was delivered at Sarnath, not in connection with IAD. IAD commemorates a different significant event in the Buddha's life. This distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of different key events in Buddhism.

Statement 2 is correct. IAD commemorates the Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka (celestial realm) to Sankassiya (now Sankisa), and the Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankisa does indeed mark this location.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the specific event commemorated by IAD and its historical context.  The UPSC may ask about lesser-known Buddhist observances.


**5. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is solely driven by the Ministry of Textiles, aiming to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.
2. Blockchain technology is utilized to ensure 100% traceability and certification of Kasturi cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Textiles plays a major role, the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry itself.  This highlights the collaborative nature of the initiative, a detail that might be missed by candidates focusing solely on the Ministry's role.

Statement 2 is correct.  Blockchain technology is a core component of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative. It ensures the complete traceability and certification of the cotton, from farm to market, enhancing its credibility and appeal in the global market.  This emphasizes the technological aspect of the initiative, a point often relevant in questions about modern agricultural practices and supply chain management.


**6.  With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The original Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, primarily focused on Buddhist studies, excluding other disciplines.
2. The modern Nalanda University, inaugurated recently, is situated near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Rajgir, Bihar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University, while renowned for its Buddhist studies, was a comprehensive center of learning.  It offered a wide range of subjects, including  Vedas,  various schools of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana),  fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and even war strategy. This statement tests the candidate's knowledge of the breadth of subjects taught at the ancient university.

Statement 2 is correct. The newly established Nalanda University is indeed located near the ruins of the ancient university in Rajgir, Bihar, reflecting a connection to its historical predecessor and aiming to revive its legacy as a center of learning. This statement is a straightforward factual recall, testing knowledge of the location of the modern university.


**7. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra is a hand gesture signifying protection and reassurance, often associated with the Buddha.
2. The Bhumisparsha Mudra, another Buddhist hand gesture, symbolizes the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Abhaya Mudra is indeed a hand gesture symbolizing fearlessness, protection, and reassurance, frequently depicted in Buddhist art and iconography.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of Buddhist symbolism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhumisparsha Mudra is a significant Buddhist gesture, it symbolizes the Buddha's calling upon the Earth to witness his victory over Mara, the personification of evil and temptation, during his meditation under the Bodhi tree. It is not directly related to the attainment of enlightenment itself, but rather a crucial moment in his path to enlightenment. This tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of different Buddhist mudras.


**8. With reference to the cultural property agreement signed between India and the USA, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to facilitate the rapid return of Indian antiquities illicitly trafficked to the United States.
2.  The agreement primarily focuses on preventing the smuggling of modern Indian art and artifacts, excluding ancient antiquities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The cultural property agreement (CPA) between India and the USA is specifically designed to enhance cooperation in preventing and combating the illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts and antiquities, aiming for their swift repatriation to India. This tests the candidate's understanding of international cooperation in protecting cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement encompasses a broad range of archaeological and ethnological material of Indian origin, including ancient antiquities. It is not limited to modern artifacts. This statement introduces a misleading focus to test the candidate's precision in recalling the scope of the agreement.


**9. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The award is presented biennially by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
2. Satyajit Ray was among the early recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, receiving it in 1985.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented *annually*, not biennially, and it is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the award's frequency and administering body.

Statement 2 is correct. Satyajit Ray was indeed a recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, receiving it in 1985, highlighting the prestigious nature of the award and the recognition of his contribution to Indian cinema. This tests the candidate's knowledge of prominent recipients of the award.


**10. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, coinciding with the Winter Solstice.
2. The draft resolution proposing IYD was initiated by India and received support from over 170 member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While June 21st is indeed IYD, it coincides with the *Summer* Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, not the Winter Solstice. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the astronomical context of IYD.

Statement 2 is correct. India did indeed initiate the draft resolution proposing IYD, and it received the endorsement of a record 175 member states, demonstrating the global appeal of yoga and India's soft power.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the international support for IYD.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Republic Day.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri recognizes distinguished service of a high order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day, although the actual conferment ceremony may occur later.  The slight inaccuracy lies in the timing; while announced on Republic Day, the awards are conferred later. This minor detail, however, doesn't invalidate the core statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Padma Vibhushan is indeed awarded for exceptional and distinguished service. However, the Padma Shri is awarded for distinguished service, not "distinguished service of a high order."  The hierarchy is Padma Vibhushan (highest), Padma Bhushan (middle), and Padma Shri (lowest).  The description in statement 2 reverses the relative importance of Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri. This factual error makes the statement incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct.


**2. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded posthumously only in exceptionally deserving cases.
2.  The award is accompanied by a monetary grant of a significant amount.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While initially not conferred posthumously, the practice has changed, and it's now granted posthumously in highly deserving cases.  The key here is the "exceptionally deserving cases" clause, which accurately reflects the practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna does *not* include any monetary grant. This is a crucial piece of information often overlooked, making it an effective distractor.  The prestige and honor associated with the award are its sole components.  Therefore, only statement 1 aligns with the facts.


**3. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are based on write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal.
2.  The awards are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anubhav Awards are indeed based on write-ups (Anubhav write-ups) submitted by retiring central government employees/pensioners on the Anubhav Portal. This directly reflects the award's core premise.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. While both are related to government administration, this difference is significant enough to make the statement factually incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the Anubhav Awards.


**4. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards.
2. The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The listed awards are indeed gallantry awards, but they are not all exclusively peacetime awards.  The Param Vir Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1950 as wartime gallantry awards.  The other awards (Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra) were instituted later and are primarily for peacetime bravery. The statement's broad claim of all being peacetime awards is false.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Param Vir Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1950, the Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1952.  The confusion of dates is a common error, making this an effective distractor.  Therefore, both statements contain factual inaccuracies.


**5. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and were initially called "State Awards."
2. The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Film Awards were indeed established in 1954 and were initially known as "State Awards." This is a well-documented fact in the history of Indian cinema.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has been responsible for administering the National Film Awards since 1973.  This is a key detail in the organizational structure of the awards.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**6. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum won the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in 2023.
2. The award considers projects’ ecological, social, and cultural impacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was *shortlisted* for the award, not the winner.  This subtle difference between "shortlisted" and "won" is crucial and often missed.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award explicitly takes into account the ecological, social, and cultural impacts of the projects it considers. This aligns with the award's stated principles of sustainable development.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was formed in 1927, with Jawaharlal Nehru as its first President.
2. The IOA coordinates with National Sports Federations to send teams to the Olympics and other international games.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IOA was indeed formed in 1927, its first President was Sir Dorabji Tata, not Jawaharlal Nehru.  This detail regarding the founding president is a key point often missed, creating a good distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The IOA's primary function is to coordinate with National Sports Federations to select and send Indian teams to the Olympics and other international sporting events.  This is a fundamental aspect of the IOA's role.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton from India with 100% traceability and certification, utilizing blockchain technology.
2. The initiative is solely implemented by the Cotton Corporation of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat is indeed a premium quality Indian cotton with 100% traceability and certification achieved using blockchain technology. This highlights the initiative's unique features.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, the initiative is a joint effort by the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  The statement's oversimplification of the implementation agency is a key error.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**9. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is executed by the National Gallery of Modern Art alone.
2. The project aims to promote democratization of art through public installations in urban landscapes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is a joint initiative executed by both the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.  This collaborative aspect is a significant detail that often gets overlooked.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core aim of Project PARI is to democratize art by creating public art installations in urban areas, making art more accessible to the public. This is the central objective of the project.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the Project PARI initiative.


**10. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative aims to provide training and awareness to local communities to enhance tourism experiences.
2. The initiative focuses exclusively on training women in tourism-related skills.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative aims to improve tourist experiences by training local communities (both men and women) to become tourism ambassadors and provide better services. This is the main goal of the program.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initiative gives special emphasis on training women and youth, it doesn't focus *exclusively* on women.  The program aims to train both men and women to develop new tourism products and services.  The statement's exclusionary focus creates a misleading distractor. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately describes the initiative.


**11. With reference to Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry is located in Mumbai.
2. GI tags protect the unique identity and quality of products linked to specific geographical regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Registry is located in Chennai, not Mumbai.  The location of the registry is a specific fact that is often overlooked.

Statement 2 is correct. GI tags are indeed designed to protect the unique identity, quality, and reputation of products associated with specific geographical regions.  This is the fundamental purpose of GI tags. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. With reference to the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. The depiction of Lady Justice with a blindfold originated in Greek mythology.
2. The blindfold symbolizes impartiality in the administration of justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The depiction of Lady Justice with a blindfold originated during the Renaissance period, not in Greek mythology.  While the figure of Justice has ancient roots, the blindfold was a later addition.

Statement 2 is correct. The blindfold on Lady Justice is a widely understood symbol of impartiality, signifying that justice should be blind to factors like wealth, power, or social status.  This is the core meaning of the iconic image. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the symbolism of the statue.


**13. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University was founded by Chandragupta Maurya in the 4th century BCE.
2. The university's library, "Dharma Gunj," held over nine million books.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, not by Chandragupta Maurya in the 4th century BCE.  The confusion of ruler and century is a common error.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the "Dharma Gunj" library was vast, the claim of over nine million books is an exaggeration.  While the exact number is debated, it was certainly not in the millions.  The exaggeration is designed to be a misleading distractor.  Therefore, both statements are factually incorrect.


**14. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.
2. The Ramcharitmanas is included in the International Register of the MoW Programme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MoW Programme was launched in 1992, and it does maintain three registers: International, Regional, and National. This reflects the program's structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ramcharitmanas is a significant literary work, there's no evidence suggesting it's specifically included in the International Register of the MoW Programme.  The inclusion of this specific text is a misleading distractor.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**15. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to the most outstanding writer of the year.
2. Ruskin Bond is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Akademi, but it's not awarded annually to the "most outstanding writer of the year." It is reserved for lifetime achievement and given to a select few, not annually to a single recipient. The description of the award's criteria is misleading.

Statement 2 is correct. Ruskin Bond is a well-known recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship. This is a verifiable fact. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**16. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when Lord Buddha gave his first sermon at Sarnath.
2. The Ministry of Culture observes IAD in association with the International Buddhist Confederation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Sankassiya, not his first sermon at Sarnath.  The confusion of events is a common mistake.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture does observe IAD in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation. This is a factual detail about the event's organization.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.





Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on economics, with detailed explanations:


**1. With reference to the economic contributions of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. She established Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh as the center of trade and commerce, significantly boosting the local economy.
2.  Under her rule, the Maheswari weaving industry flourished, with "Maheswar Sarees & Fabric" eventually receiving Geographical Indication (GI) tag recognition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw a significant economic transformation in Malwa.  Statement 1 is correct because she strategically chose Maheshwar as the capital of the Holkar dynasty, fostering its growth as a major center for trade and commerce. This led to increased economic activity, attracting merchants and boosting the local economy.  Statement 2 is also correct. Her patronage of the Maheswari weaving industry played a crucial role in its development and economic significance. The subsequent GI tag for "Maheswar Sarees & Fabric" is a testament to the enduring legacy of this industry's quality and economic impact, directly linked to Ahilyabai's support.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect her economic contributions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of her economic impact on Maheshwar and the Maheswari weaving industry.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the economic impact of the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty's involvement in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819) resulted in significant economic losses and the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur, which imposed restrictive economic conditions on the dynasty.
2.  Maheswar and Indore flourished as centers of trade and commerce during the Holkar Dynasty, primarily due to the patronage of rulers like Devi Ahilyabai Holkar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's economic trajectory. Statement 1 is correct because the Third Anglo-Maratha War had severe economic consequences for the Holkar Dynasty.  The resulting Treaty of Mandsaur imposed limitations on their political and, consequently, economic power, significantly impacting their control over resources and trade. Statement 2 is also correct;  Maheswar and Indore experienced economic prosperity under the Holkar Dynasty, particularly during Devi Ahilyabai Holkar’s reign.  Her initiatives fostered trade, commerce, and artisan industries, contributing to the economic growth of these cities. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to recognize the complex economic landscape influenced by both warfare and patronage during the Holkar era.


**3. With reference to Swami Dayanand Saraswati's economic philosophy, consider the following statements:**

1. He advocated for a state-sponsored education system to uplift the economy, emphasizing the burden of compulsory education should be borne by the king/state.
2. His economic vision primarily focused on promoting traditional industries and rejecting Western industrialization as detrimental to India's economic development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Swami Dayanand Saraswati's economic views were interwoven with his social and educational reforms. Statement 1 is correct; he strongly advocated for a comprehensive education system, where the state played a critical role in providing compulsory education to all.  He believed that education was crucial for economic progress and social upliftment, placing the responsibility for funding and implementation on the ruler or the state.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Dayanand championed traditional values and Vedic learning, his economic vision wasn't solely focused on resisting Western industrialization. He didn't explicitly oppose industrialization; rather, his main focus was on education and social reform as the bedrock of economic advancement. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects his economic philosophy. Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent or oversimplify his economic perspectives.


**4. With reference to the economic aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amara-Nayaka system, while effective in military administration, led to decentralized economic control, hindering the empire's overall economic integration.
2. The empire's significant agricultural output, facilitated by efficient irrigation systems, contributed substantially to its economic strength.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vijayanagara Empire's economic structure was complex and had both strengths and weaknesses. Statement 1 is correct. The Amara-Nayaka system, while crucial for military strength, did lead to a degree of economic decentralization.  The Nayakas controlled significant territories and resources, resulting in variations in economic policies and practices across the empire, which could hinder overall economic integration and centralized control. Statement 2 is also correct. The Vijayanagara Empire was known for its highly productive agriculture. This was partly facilitated by the development and maintenance of sophisticated irrigation systems, which ensured consistent agricultural output and contributed significantly to the empire's overall economic prosperity.  The abundance of agricultural resources formed a base for trade and economic development. Therefore, both statements reflect valid aspects of the empire's economic system.  Options (a), (b), and (d) present incomplete or inaccurate views of the empire's economic organization.



**1. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's father was a high-ranking official in the Peshwa's administration, responsible for collecting 'Chouth' and 'Sardeshmukhi' in Malwa.
2.  She significantly contributed to the revival of the Maheshwari weaving industry, establishing Maheshwar as a prominent center of trade and commerce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, was indeed an officer under the Peshwa Baji Rao, tasked with collecting 'Chouth' (a type of tax) and 'Sardeshmukhi' (another tax) in the Malwa region.  This position provided the Holkar dynasty with significant power and influence.  While her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, is mentioned, his specific role is less prominently detailed and not directly linked to tax collection in Malwa. The question is designed to create confusion by focusing on the father-in-law's role, which is a key aspect of the Holkar family's rise.

Statement 2 is also correct. Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw Maheshwar flourishing as a trade and commerce hub.  She actively promoted the Maheshwari weaving industry, which is still recognized today with a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its sarees and fabrics. This showcases her astute economic policies and their lasting impact. The question uses the word "significantly" to introduce ambiguity as it might be arguable how significantly she contributed to the revival.


**2. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's philanthropic endeavors primarily focused on establishing educational institutions for boys, reflecting the prevalent societal norms of his time.
2.  He played a crucial role in shaping the urban landscape of Mumbai, contributing significantly to its architectural planning and infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions his patronage of education, it specifically highlights his emphasis on education for *girls*, which was quite progressive for his time.  The statement tries to mislead the candidate by presenting a common misconception about societal norms during that era.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage clearly states that Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was instrumental in planning buildings, streets, and avenues in Bombay (now Mumbai), thus playing a key role in shaping the city's architectural and infrastructural development. This aspect of his contribution is straightforward and directly supported by the provided text.


**3. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's legacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago focused primarily on promoting a specific sect within Hinduism, rather than presenting a broader philosophical perspective.
2.  His interactions with Jamsetji Tata led to the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), showcasing his influence on the development of scientific institutions in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions that Vivekananda's address was hailed for its broad appeal and presentation of Indian wisdom to the West.  It does not limit his message to a specific sect but rather highlights his Vedanta philosophy, which encompasses various schools of thought. The question attempts to create confusion by suggesting a narrow focus, contradicting the text's emphasis on his universal message.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly links Vivekananda's meeting with Jamsetji Tata in 1893 to the subsequent establishment of the IISc in Bangalore.  This illustrates his influence in inspiring the creation of a major scientific institution in India.  The precise details of his involvement might be debated, but the causal link is clearly presented in the given text.


**4. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded only to Indian citizens for their exceptional contributions to various fields.
2.  The selection process for the Bharat Ratna involves a formal nomination procedure with a dedicated committee responsible for evaluating candidates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text does not specify that the award is exclusively for Indian citizens. Although it's generally understood to be so, the given information doesn't explicitly state this.  The question exploits this potential ambiguity to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that there is *no formal recommendation* process, although the Prime Minister makes a suggestion to the President.  The absence of a formal committee and a clearly defined nomination process contradicts the statement.  The question plays on the common assumption of a rigorous selection process for such a prestigious award.


**5. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by implementing a strict government-controlled certification process.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text emphasizes that the initiative works on the principle of *self-regulation* by the ginners, not strict government control. This detail is crucial and serves as a significant point of difference, making it a strong distractor. The question plays on the common assumption that government initiatives usually involve strict regulatory mechanisms.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly identifies TEXPROCIL as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.  This information is directly stated and easily verifiable within the provided text.


**6. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is uniquely situated at the confluence of seven rivers, making it a significant pilgrimage site.
2.  There is only one Sangameshwar Temple in India, located in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, dedicated to Lord Shiva.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Nandyal temple is situated at a confluence of rivers, the text mentions only five tributaries along with Krishna and Bhavansi, not seven. The addition of two extra rivers is a deliberate attempt to create a false statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions the existence of Sangameshwar temples in other locations, including Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, highlighting that it is not a unique location.  The question uses a strong distractor by focusing on the Nandyal temple and implying uniqueness.


**7. With reference to the  Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Holkar Dynasty played a significant role in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, ultimately leading to their defeat and the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur.
2. Malhar Rao Holkar II's defeat in the Battle of Mahidpur marked a turning point, significantly impacting the Holkar's relationship with the British.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text mentions the Holkar Dynasty's involvement in the *Third* Anglo-Maratha War, not the Second.  The incorrect war number serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Malhar Rao II's defeat at Mahidpur and the subsequent signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818 significantly altered the relationship between the Holkars and the British. This is a direct and easily verifiable fact from the provided information.


**8. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Dayanand Saraswati's Arya Samaj movement primarily focused on social reform within the existing Hindu framework, avoiding any proselytization or attempts to convert individuals from other faiths.
2. The Arya Samaj movement led to the establishment of numerous educational institutions, including the first Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) school in Lahore in 1886.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Arya Samaj was the *first Hindu organization to introduce proselytization*, directly contradicting the statement.  This is a crucial detail highlighting a key aspect of the Arya Samaj's approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions the establishment of numerous educational institutions and specifically cites the first DAV school in Lahore in 1886 as an example of the Arya Samaj's impact on education.  This is a readily verifiable fact from the source material.


**9. With reference to the  Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement allows for visa-free travel for all Sikh pilgrims from Pakistan to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in India.
2.  The agreement stipulated a fee of USD 20 per pilgrim for each visit to be levied by Pakistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the agreement provides visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, but *not* vice-versa.  Pakistani Sikhs still require an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak.  The reversal of the travel direction is a deliberate attempt to create confusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that Pakistan levies a fee of USD 20 per pilgrim for each visit to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.  This is a straightforward fact directly stated in the text.


**10. With reference to the  Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha resulted in the immediate and complete removal of all caste-based restrictions on temple entry in Travancore.
2.  The Vaikom Satyagraha highlighted the differences in approach between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, concerning the nature and goals of the movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that the Satyagraha led to legal reforms and the Temple Entry Proclamation in 1936, but it was *not* an immediate and complete removal of all restrictions. Only three out of four roads were opened. The question uses the words "immediate and complete" to create a false statement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly describes the differing perspectives of Gandhi and Periyar on the Vaikom Satyagraha, with Gandhi viewing it as a Hindu reformist movement and Periyar seeing it as a fight against caste-based atrocities. This divergence in interpretation and the subsequent actions are clearly detailed in the provided text.


**1. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1.  The agreement establishing the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor allows visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, but Pakistani Sikhs require Indian visas to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India.
2.  The corridor agreement, initially valid for five years, imposes a USD 20 fee on each pilgrim per visit and restricts access to only those of Sikh faith.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement facilitates visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan. However, reciprocal access is not granted; Pakistani Sikhs need Indian visas to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India. This asymmetry highlights the geopolitical complexities surrounding religious pilgrimage and cross-border movement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the agreement did initially have a 5-year validity period (which has since been extended) and a USD 20 fee per pilgrim visit, it explicitly states *no restriction* on the faith of pilgrims using the corridor.  Anyone can use it, regardless of their religious affiliation. This reflects an attempt to foster broader religious tourism and people-to-people contact, though the reality on the ground may differ. The imposition of a fee is a separate matter of policy, not a religious restriction.


**2. With reference to the teachings of Guru Nanak, consider the following statements:**

1.  Guru Nanak's emphasis on "seva," or selfless service, is a core tenet of Sikhism, primarily focused on addressing poverty and inequality within the Sikh community.
2.  Guru Nanak's teachings on religious tolerance and equality, while advocating for social justice, did not explicitly reject the caste system prevalent during his time.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While "seva" is central to Sikhism, its scope extends far beyond addressing poverty and inequality within only the Sikh community.  Guru Nanak's teachings promote selfless service to all humanity, irrespective of religious or social background.  The concept of "seva" encompasses a broad humanitarian approach, not a limited, sectarian one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Guru Nanak strongly advocated against the caste system, a key aspect of his teachings on social equality. He explicitly rejected the discriminatory practices associated with the caste system, emphasizing the equality of all individuals before God.  His message directly challenged the prevailing social hierarchy of his time.


**3. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, was the first Hindu organization to actively promote proselytization, aiming to convert non-Hindus to Hinduism through missionary work.
2.  A significant schism within the Arya Samaj occurred in 1892, primarily due to disagreements over the promotion of Sanskrit as the primary language of religious instruction and the adoption of a strict vegetarian diet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Arya Samaj, unlike many traditional Hindu schools of thought, actively promoted proselytization,  seeking to spread its interpretation of Vedic teachings to those outside the Hindu faith.  This was a significant departure from the generally inward-looking nature of many earlier Hindu movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a split did occur in the Arya Samaj in 1892, the primary cause was not solely about the promotion of Sanskrit or a strict vegetarian diet. The division was more complex, involving ideological differences between a conservative (Gurukul) and a more radical (college) group.  Disagreements over the interpretation of Vedic texts and the methods of social reform played a more significant role in the schism than dietary or linguistic preferences alone.


**4. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago was instrumental in introducing Vedanta philosophy to a global audience, and his message emphasized the compatibility of Hinduism with other world religions.
2.  Swami Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 primarily to focus on monastic life and spiritual contemplation, leaving social service activities to other organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's powerful and eloquent speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 was a watershed moment.  It significantly broadened Western understanding of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism, portraying it as a compatible and inclusive faith.  His message of universal tolerance and brotherhood resonated widely.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While spiritual contemplation was important to the Ramakrishna Mission, established in 1897, social service was a central and integral part of its mission from the outset. The organization actively engages in various social reform and welfare activities, including education, healthcare, and rural development.  This reflects Vivekananda's belief in the practical application of spiritual principles to improve society.


**5. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, after assuming power in 1767, primarily focused on consolidating her political power and military strength, neglecting the reconstruction of temples and promotion of arts and culture.
2.  Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage extended to notable Marathi poets like Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi, who contributed significantly to the cultural landscape of the Holkar kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ahilyabai Holkar was a shrewd political leader who strengthened her kingdom, she is equally renowned for her extensive patronage of arts, culture, and temple reconstruction.  She oversaw the rebuilding and renovation of numerous temples across India, including significant structures at Varanasi and Somnath. This reflects her deep religious devotion and her commitment to cultural preservation.

Statement 2 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was a significant patron of arts and literature.  She actively supported Marathi poets like Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi, fostering their creative work and contributing to the flourishing of Marathi literature during her reign.

Under rulers like Krishnadevaraya, the empire significantly expanded its territory, achieving military successes against neighboring kingdoms and consolidating its dominance in South India.  This period represents the high point of Vijayanagara's political and military influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Vijayanagara emperor held ultimate authority, the empire's administration was not entirely centralized.  It utilized a decentralized system, employing Amara-Nayakas—military commanders—who were granted territories to govern.  These Nayakas collected taxes, retaining a portion for their upkeep and administration, indicating a degree of autonomy within the broader imperial structure.  The system was a mix of centralized control and decentralized administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bhagwan Mahaveer, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, is revered for his strong emphasis on Ahimsa (non-violence) as the highest principle of life. His teachings significantly shaped Jain monastic traditions and practices, particularly regarding the strict adherence to non-violence in all aspects of life.  His contributions continue to influence Jain philosophy and practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2550th Bhagwan Mahaveer Nirvan Mahotsav commemorates the *Nirvana* (liberation) of Mahaveer, not his death anniversary.  While Nirvana marks the end of his earthly existence, the celebration focuses on the spiritual attainment of liberation rather than his death as a physical event.  The distinction reflects the Jain focus on spiritual liberation as the ultimate goal.


**1. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  She significantly patronized Marathi poets like Moropant, who authored works including "Political commentary on Ramayana and Mahabharata" and "Aryabhata," and Shahir Anantaphandi, renowned for composing Lavani and Powadas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

She supported renowned Marathi poets like Moropant, known for his diverse works including political commentaries on epics and astronomical treatises like "Aryabhata," and Shahir Anantaphandi, famous for his Lavani and Powada compositions. This patronage reflects her commitment to cultural preservation and promotion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Devi Ahilyabai Holkar did promote the Maheswari weaving industry in Maheshwar, leading to its eventual recognition with a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, her economic policies extended beyond this. She actively fostered trade and commerce in Maheshwar and Indore, making them significant centers of economic activity during her reign.  The statement oversimplifies her economic contributions by focusing solely on the Maheswari industry and incorrectly suggesting a neglect of other trade aspects.  Her economic vision was broader, encompassing the overall growth and prosperity of her kingdom.


**2. With reference to the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangam literature, encompassing works like Tolkappiyam, Ettuthokai, and Pathuppattu, extensively documented the social hierarchy system known as Varna, detailing its impact on various aspects of society.
2.  The Sangam poets, while mentioning the Varna system, primarily focused on the literary and artistic expressions of the period, with minimal direct engagement with the social and political implications of the caste system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Sangam literature does mention the Varna system, it's an overstatement to say it "extensively documented" its impact on all aspects of society. The focus of Sangam literature was broader, encompassing a range of themes, including love, nature, war, and societal customs. The portrayal of the Varna system is not its central theme.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Sangam poets, while acknowledging the existence of the Varna system, primarily concentrated on artistic and literary expressions of their time.  Their works offer valuable insights into the culture, language, and societal structures of the Sangam Age, but the social and political implications of the caste system are not the primary focus of their literary output.  Their work provides a glimpse into the social realities, but it’s not a comprehensive sociological study of the Varna system's impact.


**3. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the Arya Samaj's core tenets, including the principle of "Krinvanto Vishwamaryam," emphasized the importance of Vedic scriptures as the sole source of true knowledge and rejected any other religious texts or philosophies.
2.  The Arya Samaj, while promoting Vedic principles, actively engaged in social reform, establishing numerous educational institutions and orphanages, notably the first Dayanand Anglo Vedic (DAV) school in Lahore, and played a role in the upliftment of the marginalized.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Dayanand Saraswati emphasized the Vedic scriptures as a primary source of knowledge and the Arya Samaj promoted Vedic principles, it is inaccurate to say they rejected *all* other religious texts or philosophies. The Arya Samaj's philosophy, while rooted in the Vedas, also incorporated elements of universalism and rationalism.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and exclusionary interpretation of the Arya Samaj's intellectual foundation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arya Samaj, beyond its theological tenets, actively engaged in social reform and educational initiatives.  The establishment of numerous educational institutions and orphanages, including the first DAV school in Lahore, demonstrates its commitment to social upliftment and education, particularly for the marginalized communities.  This aspect of the Arya Samaj's activities is well-documented and reflects its broader social impact.

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), led by prominent figures like Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, planned and executed the Kakori train robbery to secure funds for their revolutionary activities, primarily aiming to overthrow the British Raj through armed rebellion.
2.  The Kakori train action, while initially successful in securing funds, ultimately led to the swift capture and execution of the HRA leaders, severely weakening the organization and its revolutionary efforts, resulting in a significant setback for the Indian independence movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), with key figures like Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan, orchestrated the Kakori train robbery to obtain funds for their revolutionary movement against British rule.  Their aim was to utilize these funds to support and expand their armed struggle for Indian independence.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Kakori conspiracy, despite its initial success in acquiring funds, resulted in the arrest and subsequent execution of several HRA leaders. This dealt a significant blow to the organization and its revolutionary activities, temporarily hindering the momentum of their movement. While the HRA continued its efforts, the Kakori incident marked a turning point, significantly impacting its strength and operational capabilities.


**5. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Santhal Rebellion, triggered by widespread land alienation and economic exploitation, involved a large number of Santhal communities spread across a significant geographical area. This widespread participation and scale distinguish it as one of the most extensive peasant uprisings during British rule in India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Karl Marx's analysis of the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution underscores its historical significance.  The rebellion's scale and organization served as a potent example of peasant resistance, influencing subsequent nationalist movements and shaping the discourse on agrarian struggles in colonial India.  Marx's recognition of its organized nature highlights the rebellion's impact on the broader narrative of Indian resistance to colonial rule.


**6. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," was primarily caused by a combination of severe droughts, crop failures, and the British administration's inadequate response to the crisis, leading to widespread starvation and death.
2.  Following the Odisha Famine, significant infrastructural projects like the Puri Canal were undertaken to mitigate the impact of future famines, demonstrating a shift in the British administration's approach to famine relief and development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also referred to as the "Na-Anka Famine," was a devastating event caused by a combination of factors including severe droughts, widespread crop failures, and the British administration's inadequate and delayed response to the crisis.  These factors resulted in widespread starvation, disease, and a significant loss of life.

Statement 2 is also correct.  In the aftermath of the devastating Odisha Famine of 1866, the British administration implemented some infrastructural projects, including the construction of the Puri Canal (also known as the Coast Canal), to improve irrigation and reduce the vulnerability of the region to future famines.  While these measures were not comprehensive solutions, they represent a change in approach, reflecting a partial acknowledgment of the need for improved infrastructure in famine relief and development.

2.  The 21 Sikh soldiers who fought in the Battle of Saragarhi were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration for gallantry, signifying their extraordinary bravery and sacrifice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Battle of Saragarhi in 1897 is renowned for the heroic last stand of 21 Sikh soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment against a vastly superior force of Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen.  Their unwavering courage and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds have become legendary.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously recognized for their bravery, they received the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross was primarily awarded to British soldiers, and the Indian Order of Merit was the highest gallantry award bestowed upon Indian troops at that time.  The confusion between these two awards is a common misconception.


**8. With reference to Jyotirmath (Joshimath), consider the following statements:**

1.  Jyotirmath, located in Uttarakhand, is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya, serving as a significant center for the propagation of Advaita Vedanta philosophy and a winter abode for pilgrims visiting Badrinath.
2. The recent renaming of Joshimath to Jyotirmath reflects a broader initiative by the Uttarakhand government to rebrand and promote the religious and cultural heritage of the region, focusing solely on the religious significance of the place and neglecting its significance as a mountaineering base camp.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jyotirmath, situated in Uttarakhand, holds immense religious and historical importance as one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya.  It serves as a vital center for the dissemination of Advaita Vedanta philosophy and also functions as the winter abode for the deity of Badrinath temple.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the renaming of Joshimath to Jyotirmath does highlight the religious significance of the place, it’s an oversimplification to say it *solely* focuses on religious aspects and neglects its importance as a mountaineering base camp.  The renaming primarily emphasizes the historical and religious significance, but the town’s role as a base camp for mountaineers remains an important part of its identity. The statement misrepresents the motivations behind the renaming and the multifaceted nature of Jyotirmath's significance.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Alagar Temple, located on the Alagar Hills near Madurai, is indeed one of the 108 Divya Desams sacred to Lord Vishnu, where he is worshipped as Kallazhagar.  Its significance is further established by its mention in the Tamil epic Silappadikaram.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Alagar Temple does incorporate elements of the Nayaka style in its mandapam pillars, its overall architectural style is not solely Dravidian. It blends various architectural influences, making a simple categorization as predominantly Dravidian an oversimplification. The statement presents an inaccurate and incomplete description of the temple's architectural complexity.  The temple's architecture is a fusion of styles, reflecting its long history and evolving artistic influences.

Statement 1 is accurate because the initiative's core aim is to improve the global standing of Indian cotton through complete traceability and certification, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency and accountability in the supply chain. This enhances consumer trust and allows for better quality control. Statement 2 is also correct as TEXPROCIL acts as the implementing agency, driving the initiative's execution and overseeing the self-regulation aspect where ginners take ownership of branding, traceability, and certification. This decentralized approach promotes efficiency and empowers stakeholders within the cotton industry.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Project PARI (Public Art of India) is indeed a Ministry of Culture initiative, executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Its primary goal is to make art more accessible to the public by showcasing it in urban landscapes, transforming public spaces into accessible art galleries.  This aligns perfectly with statement 1. However, statement 2 is inaccurate. While the project does incorporate traditional Indian art forms like Thangka, Cheriyal, and Alpana, it is not limited to these styles alone. The project embraces a wider range of visual art forms, including paintings, murals, and sculptures, created by over 150 artists from across India.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely correct.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is a national responsible tourism program launched by the Ministry of Tourism.  However, statement 1 is incorrect as it is launched across 50, not 100, tourist destinations. Statement 2 is also incorrect because while the initiative aims to promote responsible tourism, it doesn't exclusively focus on training women as guides. The program encompasses a broader range of initiatives aimed at enhancing the overall tourism experience and sustainability.  Both statements contain inaccuracies.  Therefore, the correct option is (d).


**4. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

The NMHC at Lothal is indeed being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, utilizing a PPP model.  Its purpose is to showcase India's rich maritime heritage across different eras. This makes statement 1 accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Lothal was a significant port city, it belonged to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), not the Gupta Empire. The NMHC's focus will be on highlighting Lothal's importance within the context of the IVC, including its advanced dockyard technology and its role in trade. The Gupta period is much later. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India intentionally departs from the traditional Western depiction.  Instead of Western attire, she is shown wearing a saree, aligning the symbol with Indian traditions and signifying a move towards decoloniality.  The choice of attire is a deliberate effort to represent Indian cultural identity within the legal system.

Statement 2 is correct. The scales and sword are enduring symbols associated with Lady Justice. The scales represent the impartial weighing of evidence and arguments presented before the court, ensuring fairness and objectivity in judicial decisions. The sword symbolizes the authority and power of the law, its ability to enforce justice and uphold the rule of law.  These elements are retained in the new statue, underscoring the core principles of the judicial system.  The fact that these traditional symbols are maintained while other aspects of the statue are altered shows a careful balancing of tradition and modern interpretation.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court flag does include the Ashok Chakra at the top and the Book of the Constitution at the bottom,  the central image is not the national emblem but an iconic representation of the Supreme Court building itself. This symbolizes the institution's central role within the Indian judicial system.  The design does not explicitly represent the three pillars of the judiciary, although the building's representation could be interpreted as embodying the principles of the judiciary.

Statement 2 is correct. The insignia of the Supreme Court of India prominently features the Sanskrit phrase "Yato Dharmastato Jayah." This phrase encapsulates the core principle that justice and victory are inextricably linked to righteousness and adherence to dharma. It emphasizes the moral and ethical foundation of the Indian judicial system.  The inclusion of this Sanskrit phrase highlights the historical and cultural context within which the Supreme Court operates.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha's central aim was to secure the right of entry for lower-caste Hindus (particularly Ezhavas) into the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, which was previously restricted to upper-caste Hindus. The movement was not directly focused on voting rights, although the broader context involved social and political inequalities.  The struggle for temple entry was symbolic of the larger fight against caste discrimination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi expressed support for the Vaikom Satyagraha and offered guidance, he did not directly lead the movement. Key leaders such as T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan played pivotal roles in organizing and spearheading the protests.  Gandhi's involvement was primarily through his moral support and advocacy, rather than direct participation in the day-to-day activities of the Satyagraha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The official dismantling of the Apartheid system in South Africa occurred in 1994, not 1964.  While international pressure and domestic resistance were significant factors in its eventual demise, the complete dismantling was a gradual process that culminated in the first multiracial elections in 1994.  The year 1964 is significant as it marks the year Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nelson Mandela was a key figure in the struggle against Apartheid, his early activism involved both non-violent and armed resistance strategies.  Moreover, during his 27 years of imprisonment, his direct leadership of the resistance movement was limited, although his symbolic presence remained immensely powerful and inspiring to the anti-Apartheid movement.  The struggle was led by many different organizations and individuals even during Mandela's imprisonment.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion (1855-1856) was not directly caused by the Permanent Settlement system.  The rebellion stemmed from a complex interplay of factors, including the encroachment of British colonial authorities and moneylenders onto Santhal lands, leading to exploitation, dispossession, and the erosion of traditional Santhal systems of governance.  The Permanent Settlement, while a significant factor in land relations elsewhere in British India, wasn't the primary cause of this specific rebellion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Karl Marx did comment on the Santhal Rebellion, describing it as India's first organized mass revolution, he didn't directly link it to the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 as a precursor.  Both events were significant expressions of resistance against British rule, but they were distinct in their causes, locations, and participants.  The Santhal Rebellion was primarily a tribal uprising, while the Sepoy Mutiny was largely a military revolt.


**6.  With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based solely on the assessment of their physical condition and state of preservation.
2.  The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, explicitly defines the criteria for "missing monuments" as a basis for delisting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)'s decision to delist centrally protected monuments is not based solely on their physical condition.  The assessment also considers factors such as their historical significance, national importance, and the potential for future preservation efforts.  A monument might be in good physical condition but still lack sufficient national importance to warrant continued protection by the ASI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does not explicitly define "missing monuments" as a category for delisting. The term "untraceable monuments," used in the context of the ASI's recent actions, emerged from the observations of auditing teams and is not a legally defined term within the Act itself.  The Act does provide for delisting based on the assessment that a monument has ceased to be of national importance, but this assessment involves a broader consideration than simply whether a monument is missing or untraceable.


**7. With reference to the "Kasturi Cotton Bharat" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative aims to promote the use of genetically modified (GM) cotton varieties to enhance the quality and yield of Indian cotton.
2. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency for the "Kasturi Cotton Bharat" initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Kasturi Cotton Bharat" initiative focuses on promoting the use of premium quality, traceable Indian cotton, but it does not specifically advocate for the use of genetically modified (GM) cotton varieties. The initiative emphasizes the use of traditional cotton varieties with a focus on quality, traceability, and sustainability, utilizing blockchain technology to ensure transparency and authenticity in the supply chain.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is indeed the implementing agency responsible for overseeing and executing the "Kasturi Cotton Bharat" initiative.  TEXPROCIL plays a crucial role in coordinating with various stakeholders, including the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, and industry bodies, to achieve the initiative's objectives.  The choice of TEXPROCIL as the implementing agency highlights its expertise in the cotton and textiles sector.


**8. With reference to the "Project PARI" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI is a joint initiative by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of External Affairs to promote Indian art and culture internationally.
2. The project involves the creation of public art installations across major metropolitan cities in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is an initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Culture, and its primary focus is on promoting and showcasing Indian art within the country, rather than an international outreach program.  While the project might indirectly contribute to cultural diplomacy, its immediate aim is to enhance public spaces through art installations within India's urban landscapes. The involvement of Lalit Kala Akademi and National Gallery of Modern Art further underscores the domestic focus.

Statement 2 is correct. Project PARI aims to democratize access to art by creating public art installations in urban areas. The project seeks to transform urban landscapes into accessible galleries, making art more visible and engaging for a wider audience. This involves the creation of diverse art forms, including paintings, murals, and sculptures, by artists from across India. The project's emphasis on public installations directly contributes to enhancing public spaces and community engagement with art.


**9. With reference to the  "Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi" initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative primarily focuses on training and employing local communities in the hospitality sector to improve tourism infrastructure.
2.  The initiative aims to enhance the overall tourist experience by engaging local people as ambassadors and storytellers for their destinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi" initiative might indirectly contribute to improving tourism infrastructure by engaging local communities, its primary objective is not focused on infrastructure development.  The initiative's main emphasis is on enhancing the tourist experience through the engagement of local people, specifically focusing on training women and youth to become tourism ambassadors and storytellers.  The initiative prioritizes human capital development over infrastructure development.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative's core goal is to improve the overall tourist experience by deploying trained local individuals as ambassadors and storytellers.  These individuals provide insights into local culture, history, and traditions, enriching the tourist experience and fostering a more authentic connection with the destination.  The program's emphasis on training in tourism-related activities, including food and craft tours, further enhances the quality of the tourist experience.  The focus on women and youth also promotes economic empowerment within local communities.


**10. With reference to the  National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1. National Handloom Day is celebrated annually on August 7th to commemorate the Swadeshi movement of 1905.
2. The day aims to recognize the contributions of handloom weavers and promote the handloom industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Swadeshi movement played a significant role in promoting indigenous industries, including handlooms,  National Handloom Day is not directly linked to its anniversary.  The date of August 7th was chosen to commemorate the contributions of handloom weavers and the rich history of handloom weaving in India, but it doesn't correspond to a specific event within the Swadeshi movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of National Handloom Day is to acknowledge the valuable role of handloom weavers in India's cultural heritage and economy. The day provides an opportunity to highlight the artistic skills and craftsmanship of handloom weavers, while simultaneously promoting the handloom industry and its products.  The celebration aims to boost the demand for handloom products and ensure the sustainability of this important sector.


**1. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The primary aim is to enhance tourist experiences by connecting them with local individuals trained to act as tourism ambassadors and storytellers.
2.  A significant focus is placed on training women and youth to develop and offer unique tourism-related products and experiences, such as food and craft tours.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core objectives of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the initiative's aim to improve tourist experiences through the involvement of trained local ambassadors. These individuals are intended to provide insights and enhance the overall tourism narrative of a specific destination.  Statement 2 accurately highlights the program's emphasis on empowering women and youth by providing them with the skills and opportunities to create and deliver innovative tourism-related offerings. This focus on skill development and entrepreneurship is a key component of the initiative, aiming to foster economic growth within local communities while simultaneously enriching the tourist experience.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.


**2. With reference to Geographical Indications (GI) tags in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry, headquartered in Mumbai, is responsible for granting GI tags to products from across India.
2.  The GI tag system aims to protect and promote products unique to specific geographical regions, based on their quality and reputation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The GI tag system in India is designed to safeguard the identity and reputation of products intrinsically linked to specific geographical areas. This protection is granted based on the unique qualities and characteristics of the product, which are often a result of the region's specific environment, production techniques, or traditional knowledge.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Geographical Indications Registry does grant GI tags, its headquarters are located in Chennai, not Mumbai.  The incorrect location in statement 1 serves as a significant distractor, highlighting the need for precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.


**3. With reference to the recent changes at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The new Lady Justice statue unveiled at the Supreme Court depicts her wearing a saree, symbolizing a departure from colonial symbols and a connection to Indian traditions.
2. The new flag and insignia of the Supreme Court, designed by the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, feature the Ashok Chakra and the Supreme Court building.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India notably features the figure draped in a saree, signifying a move away from Western colonial representations and a reflection of Indian cultural identity. The change in attire is a deliberate attempt to decolonize the symbolic representation of justice within the Indian context. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court did unveil a new flag and insignia, they were conceptualized by the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), New Delhi, and not the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad. The subtle difference in the names of the design institutions acts as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge. The inclusion of the Ashok Chakra and the Supreme Court building on the new flag is accurate, but the incorrect attribution to NID makes the entire statement wrong.



**4. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on a report submitted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, assessing its national importance.
2.  Once a monument is delisted under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, it ceases to receive conservation, protection, and maintenance from the ASI, and regular construction activities can commence in the area.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct and accurately describes the consequences of delisting a monument under the AMASR Act, 1958. Delisting removes the monument from the ASI's purview of conservation and protection, allowing for other activities, including construction, in the surrounding area.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ASI bases its decision on a report from the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry of Culture assesses the national importance of the monument before recommending delisting. This subtle difference between the ministries involved serves as a significant distractor, emphasizing the importance of precise factual knowledge.


**5. With reference to Article 49 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 49, a Directive Principle of State Policy (DPSP), mandates the state to protect only ancient monuments and places of national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, is the primary legislation that complements Article 49 by providing a framework for the preservation of ancient and historical monuments and archaeological sites.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for implementing the directive in Article 49, outlining procedures for the preservation of historical monuments and archaeological sites. Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 49 directs the state to protect monuments and objects of *national importance*, not just ancient ones.  The scope is broader than just ancient monuments, encompassing any site or object deemed nationally significant. The restrictive nature of statement 1 serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's thorough understanding of the article's provisions.



**6. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The modern Nalanda University was established based on a decision made at the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2006.
2. The ancient Nalanda University was renowned for its diverse curriculum, encompassing subjects like Vedas, Buddhism (various schools), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, and political strategy.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is entirely correct, accurately describing the wide range of subjects taught at the ancient Nalanda University. This demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the university's academic scope. Statement 1 is incorrect. The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was made at the *2nd*, not the 1st, East Asia Summit, and this was held in 2007, not 2006.  The incorrect year and summit number serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the historical context.


**7. With reference to Lady Justice, consider the following statements:**

1. The addition of the blindfold to the depiction of Lady Justice originated in the Enlightenment period (17th-18th century) as a symbol of impartiality.
2.  The British introduced the statue of Lady Justice to India, first in the Madras High Court in 1862.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 incorrectly states the origin of the blindfold. The blindfold was added during the Renaissance period (14th century), initially as satire on the corrupt legal systems, later reinterpreted as a symbol of impartiality during the Enlightenment. Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts:  first, the British introduced the statue of Lady Justice to India, first in the Calcutta High Court, not Madras High Court; second, the year was 1872, not 1862. The incorrect details in both statements effectively eliminate both options, making (d) the correct answer.  This question tests the candidate's ability to identify multiple inaccuracies within a single question.


**8. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, celebrating its 100th anniversary recently, primarily focused on securing the right to education for lower-caste individuals in Travancore.
2.  Gandhiji fully supported the Vaikom Satyagraha and saw it as a crucial step towards achieving complete social equality in India.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents the core issue of the Vaikom Satyagraha. The movement primarily focused on securing the right of lower-caste individuals to access the public roads leading to the Vaikom temple, not education. Statement 2 incorrectly portrays Gandhiji's complete support for the movement. While Gandhiji did express some support, his approach and understanding differed from other leaders involved, leading to disagreements and highlighting a complex political dynamic. The inaccuracies in both statements make (d) the correct option.


**9. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) carried out the Kakori Train Action in 1926 to fund revolutionary activities by robbing a British treasury train near Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
2.  Key figures involved in the Kakori Train Action included Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Bhagat Singh.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partly incorrect. The Kakori Train Action occurred in 1925, not 1926, and it took place near Kakori, not Lucknow.  Statement 2 is also incorrect because Bhagat Singh was not directly involved in the Kakori conspiracy.  The inaccuracies in both location and the year in statement 1, and the omission of a key participant in statement 2, make both statements incorrect. This question effectively tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the event.


**10. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Instituted in 1955, the Padma Awards are conferred annually on Republic Day and Independence Day.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is the highest civilian award among the Padma Awards, followed by the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately reflects the hierarchy of the Padma Awards, with the Padma Vibhushan being the highest, followed by the Padma Bhushan, and then the Padma Shri. Statement 1 is incorrect. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, not 1955, and they are announced annually on Republic Day, not on both Republic Day and Independence Day. The incorrect year and the mention of Independence Day effectively makes statement 1 incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the precise details surrounding the Padma Awards.



**11. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions to recognize outstanding contributions of retiring central government employees.
2.  The awards are based on Anubhav write-ups, which are experiences shared by retiring central government employees on a dedicated portal.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Anubhav Awards are indeed based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees through their Anubhav write-ups on a designated portal.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.  The subtle difference in the awarding ministry acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the administrative structure.


**12. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award, followed by the Ashoka Chakra and Mahavir Chakra.
2.  These awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 incorrectly states that the Param Vir Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award.  It is the highest wartime gallantry award. The Ashoka Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award. Statement 2 is incorrect as these awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day.  The incorrect information in both statements makes (d) the correct answer, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the award system.


**13. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary is celebrated as National Doctors' Day.
2.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1898, which is actively involved in social service initiatives.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary is celebrated as National Youth Day, not National Doctors' Day.  Statement 2 is also incorrect regarding the year. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, not 1898. The incorrect dates and the wrong designation in both statements make (d) the correct option, emphasizing the need for precise factual recall.


**14. With reference to Ratan Naval Tata, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $10 billion to over $100 billion.
2.  Tata Motors received the PETA India award for using vegan interiors in its Nexon EV.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Tata Group's revenue did significantly increase under Ratan Tata's leadership, the starting figure was closer to $5 billion, not $10 billion.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Tata Motors did receive an award from PETA India for its commitment to vegan interiors, it was for the AVINYA concept car, not the Nexon EV. The incorrect figures and the wrong car model in both statements make (d) the correct answer, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific details.


**15. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India based on recommendations made by the Vice President of India.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President along with a monetary grant.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is incorrect because recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are made by the Prime Minister, not the Vice President. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Bharat Ratna does not come with any monetary grant, only a Sanad signed by the President and a medallion.  The inaccuracies in both statements make (d) the correct option.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of the award's procedures and benefits.


**16. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded to writers who have made significant contributions to Indian literature in any language, including regional languages.
2.  Ruskin Bond was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship posthumously for his outstanding contributions to children's literature.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship recognizes writers who have made exceptional contributions to Indian literature, encompassing all Indian languages.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Ruskin Bond received the fellowship while he was still alive, not posthumously.  The incorrect information about the timing of the award makes statement 2 incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the award and its recipient.


**17. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya.
2.  The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary Society, observes IAD annually.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 incorrectly identifies the event commemorated by IAD.  IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not his enlightenment. Statement 2 is incorrect as IAD is observed in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), not the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary Society.  The incorrect events and the wrong organization in both statements make (d) the correct answer.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of Buddhist history and contemporary observances.


**18. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arya Samaj was the first Hindu organization to actively promote the concept of proselytization within Hinduism.
2.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of the Arya Samaj, established numerous educational institutions and orphanages, including the first DAV school in Delhi in 1886.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Arya Samaj was indeed one of the first Hindu organizations to actively promote proselytization. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Swami Dayanand Saraswati did establish numerous educational institutions and orphanages, the first DAV school was established in Lahore, not Delhi, and in 1886.  The incorrect city and the implicit mention of the wrong founder in statement 2 make it incorrect.  The question tests knowledge of the Arya Samaj's history and activities.


**19. With reference to the  MoW Programme (Memory of the World Programme), consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme, launched in 1994, aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage and enhance public awareness about its significance.
2.  The International Register under the MoW Programme includes entries like the Rig Veda and Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The MoW Programme does aim to preserve documentary heritage and raise public awareness, and its International Register includes the mentioned entries.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of this UNESCO program and its scope.  The straightforward nature of the correct statements makes the other options easily eliminable.


**20. With reference to literary works, consider the following statements:**

1. The Panchatantra, written by Vishnu Sharma in Sanskrit, is known for its unique "story within a story" structure and is one of the oldest surviving collections of Indian fables.
2.  Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, a text of Indian poetics, was written by Abhinavagupta and is a commentary on Anandavardhana's Dhvanyāloka.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. It accurately describes the Panchatantra and its key features.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is indeed a text of Indian poetics, it was written by Anandavardhana, not Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta wrote a commentary on Dhvanyāloka, which is a different text.  The incorrect authorship in statement 2 makes it incorrect.  The question tests detailed knowledge of classical Indian literature and its authors.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly extended Chola influence into Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did strengthen Chola control over the Coromandel Coast, his naval ambitions extended far beyond it.  His destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and his conquests of Sri Lanka and parts of the Maldives demonstrate a clear expansionist naval policy reaching beyond the immediate Bay of Bengal region.  The statement misrepresents the scope of his naval power.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire is well-documented and represents a major expansion of Chola power into Southeast Asia. His conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra significantly broadened Chola influence and trade networks in the region. This expansion showcases the reach and ambition of the Chola navy far beyond the immediate Indian subcontinent. The success of this expedition is a significant marker in the history of Indian maritime power.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is primarily a modern agricultural practice adopted to enhance livestock productivity in response to climate change.
2. In India, transhumance is predominantly practiced in the Himalayan region, with nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas migrating seasonally with their herds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance is a traditional practice, not a modern one. Its origins lie in ancient times, predating modern agricultural practices and climate change concerns. While climate change might impact the routes and timing of transhumance, the practice itself is deeply rooted in history and cultural traditions. The statement incorrectly attributes the practice to a modern context.

Statement 2 is correct. The Himalayan region of India is indeed a key area for transhumance, involving various nomadic pastoralist communities who move their livestock seasonally between lower and higher altitudes. The mentioned tribes – Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas – are well-known for their participation in this traditional practice.  The description accurately reflects the geographical distribution and the participating communities in this aspect of Indian pastoralism.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MoW program focuses exclusively on preserving digital archives of historical significance, with a primary emphasis on recent technological advancements.
2. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Memory of the World (MoW) program is not limited to digital archives.  It encompasses a broad range of documentary heritage, including manuscripts, books, archives, and other significant documents regardless of their format. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the MoW program to a narrow, modern focus.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This inclusion highlights the recognition of their cultural and historical importance. The statement accurately reflects the specific inclusion of these works in the register.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Krishnadevaraya’s reign saw significant territorial expansion beyond the immediate Deccan Plateau. The text mentions the acquisition of the Raichur Doab, subjugation of Orissa, and defeats inflicted on the Sultan of Bijapur, indicating a broader expansionist policy. The statement underestimates the extent of Krishnadevaraya's territorial gains.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Amara-Nayakas as military commanders who were granted territories to rule, collecting taxes and retaining a share of the revenue for personal use and other expenses, including maintaining temples and irrigation works.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus Valley Civilization had extensive trade connections extending beyond the Indian subcontinent.  The text mentions Mesopotamian records referring to the Indus region as Meluha and the existence of intermediate trading stations in Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast), indicating a wider network of trade and interaction with other civilizations.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of Indus trade.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly mentions the presence of evidence suggesting the worship of a male deity (Pasupati, possibly proto-Shiva) and a female Mother Goddess, depicted in seals and terracotta figurines, respectively.  The absence of discovered temples is also noted, indicating a distinct religious practice unlike later periods. The statement accurately reflects the religious practices evident from the archaeological findings.

**1. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The standardized weights and measures used in the Indus Valley Civilization suggest a well-organized system of internal and external trade.
2.  Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as "Meluha" and mention Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) as intermediate trading stations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization's trade and commerce.  Statement 1 highlights the sophisticated organization implied by the uniformity of weights and measures found across the civilization's settlements. This standardization facilitated trade both within the Indus Valley and with external partners, indicating a complex economic system capable of managing large-scale exchange. The existence of such a system is a key characteristic of advanced civilizations, allowing for efficient resource allocation and economic growth.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the Mesopotamian references to the Indus region and the intermediary trading posts.  The names "Meluha," Dilmun, and Makan, appearing in Mesopotamian texts, provide external corroboration of the Indus Valley Civilization's extensive trade network reaching far beyond the geographical limits of its settlements.  These intermediary stations played crucial roles in facilitating long-distance trade, highlighting the civilization's integration into a wider commercial sphere. The presence of these external references demonstrates the significance of the Indus Valley Civilization within the ancient world's trade routes.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the evidence. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are supported by historical evidence.


**2. With reference to the religious and cultural practices of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The discovery of numerous terracotta figurines of a Mother Goddess suggests a prominent role of female deities in their religious beliefs, while the absence of large-scale temples indicates a decentralized religious system.
2.  While evidence suggests the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), depicted in seals, and the prevalence of phallus (Linga) worship, the presence of nature worship indicates a syncretic religious system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements offer accurate insights into the religious landscape of the Indus Valley Civilization. Statement 1 correctly points to the abundance of Mother Goddess figurines, suggesting a strong emphasis on female deities in their pantheon. The absence of grand temples, unlike later civilizations, points towards a possibly more decentralized or localized form of worship, with rituals perhaps conducted in domestic or smaller community settings rather than large-scale public structures. This differs from many later religious systems in India that featured large centralized temples. Statement 2 accurately describes the evidence for the worship of the male deity Pasupati, often linked to later Shiva, and the practice of phallus worship.  The simultaneous presence of nature worship, demonstrated by the veneration of trees and animals, illustrates a religious system that wasn't strictly monotheistic or focused solely on anthropomorphic deities. This blend of different forms of worship reflects a syncretic or inclusive religious perspective, where various elements coexisted without necessarily contradicting each other. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (d) is incorrect as both statements reflect valid interpretations of the available archaeological evidence.



**3. With reference to the Lothal site and the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC), consider the following statements:**

2.  Lothal's significance lies in its location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat and the discovery of the world's oldest man-made dry dock, dating back to 2400 BC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the NMHC project and the historical importance of the Lothal site. Statement 1 correctly identifies the NMHC's objective—to showcase India's rich maritime past and present—and mentions the Lighthouse Museum as one of its key components. The Sagarmala Programme's involvement underscores the government's commitment to developing India's maritime infrastructure and heritage. Statement 2 accurately describes Lothal's strategic location at the confluence of rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat, highlighting its importance as a port city in the Indus Valley Civilization. The discovery of the ancient dry dock at Lothal is a significant finding, demonstrating advanced maritime technology and engineering skills during that era.  The date of 2400 BC, while approximate, represents a significant early example of such structures.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, and option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate.



**4. With reference to India’s Maritime Heritage, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest known reference to maritime activities in India is found in the Rig Veda, preceding the Indus Valley Civilization's known maritime trade links with Mesopotamia.
2. The Cholas, during their reign (3rd-13th Century), established extensive maritime trade with Southeast Asia, while the Pandyas (6th-16th Century) primarily focused on trade with Rome, Egypt, and China, and controlled pearl farming.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Rig Veda does contain references to maritime activities,  the established evidence points to the Indus Valley Civilization's maritime trade with Mesopotamia as predating these literary references. The archaeological evidence from Lothal and other Indus Valley sites provides more concrete and earlier evidence of maritime activities compared to the more indirect references in the Rig Veda. Statement 2 correctly describes the maritime activities of the Cholas and Pandyas. The Cholas' extensive trade network in Southeast Asia is well-documented, and their naval power played a significant role in their expansion and cultural influence. The Pandyas also engaged in significant maritime trade, but their connections with Rome, Egypt, and China, along with their pearl farming activities, represent a distinct focus compared to the Cholas' Southeast Asian emphasis.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only Statement 2 reflects accurate historical data.


**5. With reference to the archaeological discoveries in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ooragutta site is an Iron Age megalithic site, while the rock art sites at Damaratogu depict animals, humans, and weapons, reflecting a diverse range of artistic expression.
2. Devarlabanda Mula, unlike other megalithic sites in the region, solely features animal depictions, lacking human or weapon imagery, and is characterized by the presence of Dolmenoid Cists, semi-subterranean chamber tombs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ooragutta's classification as an Iron Age megalithic site is accurate, and the description of Damaratogu's rock art as inclusive of animals, humans, and weapons aligns with the archaeological findings.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Devarlabanda Mula's unique feature of depicting only animals is accurate, the presence of Dolmenoid Cists is also mentioned in the context of the region as a whole, not specifically for Devarlabanda Mula.  The statement creates a misleading connection by implying that the absence of human or weapon depictions is directly linked to the presence of Dolmenoid Cists, which is not explicitly supported. Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 2.


**1. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is situated at the confluence of six rivers.
2.  The Chalukya dynasty constructed the Sangameshwar Temple at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with five other tributaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  While it is situated at a confluence of rivers, the number is six (Krishna and Bhavansi and five other tributaries), not just two as a casual reader may assume. The precise number of rivers adds a layer of complexity, making it a detail that requires specific knowledge.


Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Chalukya dynasty built the Sangameshwar Temple at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with five other tributaries. This detail showcases the historical and geographical significance of the temple's location and its connection to the Chalukya dynasty.  The inclusion of the five tributaries adds a specific detail that might easily be overlooked or misremembered, increasing the difficulty of the question.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the deity worshipped at the temple and/or the number of rivers involved.  The inclusion of a seemingly minor detail like the precise number of rivers increases the difficulty and tests the candidate's recall of specific facts.



**2. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The original Kamakhya Temple, located on the Nilachal hills, was constructed in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty using the Nilachal style of architecture.
2.  The Ambubachi Mela festival commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya and showcases the convergence of Aryan and non-Aryan beliefs and practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The original Kamakhya Temple was destroyed by Kala Pahar, and the current structure was reconstructed in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty. While the Nilachal style was used, stating it was the original style is a misrepresentation of the temple's history. The subtle distinction between the original temple and the reconstructed one makes this a challenging statement to evaluate correctly.


Statement 2 is correct. The Ambubachi Mela festival does indeed commemorate the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya. The additional detail about the convergence of Aryan and non-Aryan beliefs and practices adds a layer of complexity, requiring a more nuanced understanding of the temple's religious significance. This detail is not immediately obvious and tests the candidate's deeper knowledge of the temple's cultural context.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy in the description of the temple's construction and the potentially misleading nature of the first statement. The question effectively tests the candidate's ability to discern factual accuracy from potentially plausible but ultimately incorrect information.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  During Krishnadevaraya's reign, the Vijayanagara Empire extended its control to the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers, conquered Orissa, and inflicted defeats on the Sultan of Bijapur.
2. The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors appointed by the Vijayanagara government in each village, and their positions were hereditary under the Ayagar system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text accurately describes Krishnadevaraya's military successes during his reign, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab, subjugation of Orissa, and victories against the Sultan of Bijapur.  These are specific historical events that require knowledge of Vijayanagara history to recall accurately.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Amara-Nayakas were military commanders given territories to rule and collected taxes,  the description of their appointment as tax collectors in *each* village and their direct connection to the Ayagar system is inaccurate. The Ayagar system involved twelve functionaries at a village level,  not the Amara-Nayakas.  This subtle distinction tests the candidate's precise understanding of the Vijayanagara administrative structure.  The blurring of the roles of Amara-Nayakas and Ayagars creates a plausible distractor.


Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the functions of the Amara-Nayakas and the Ayagar system within the Vijayanagara Empire's administrative structure. The question successfully tests the candidate's knowledge of specific historical events and their ability to differentiate between closely related administrative roles.


**4. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple, located in Hampi, is a prime example of Nagara style temple architecture, characterized by its grand gopurams, Vimana, intricate carvings, and pillared halls.
2. The earliest shrine of the Virupaksha Temple was built in 740 CE by the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya to commemorate his victory over the kings from the South.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is a prime example of *Dravida*, not Nagara, style temple architecture. The description of its architectural features is accurate, but the misidentification of the architectural style creates a significant distractor. This tests the candidate's precise knowledge of architectural styles.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The earliest shrine was built in 740 CE, but by Chalukyan Queen Lokamahadevi, not by Krishnadevaraya, who belonged to the Vijayanagara Empire, centuries later.  The confusion of the builder and the chronological inaccuracy makes this a challenging statement.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical timelines and the attribution of actions to the correct historical figures.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent both the architectural style of the Virupaksha Temple and the historical details surrounding its construction.  The question requires specific knowledge of both architectural styles and historical events, making it a challenging question for candidates.


**5. With reference to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, consider the following statements:**

1. The project aimed to create an easily accessible pathway connecting the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the river Yamuna, involving the restoration of several smaller temples.
2.  The Mahakal Lok Corridor, a part of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, features murals from the 'Shiv Puran' and iconic gateways, significantly boosting tourism and the Indian economy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project connected the temple to the banks of the Ganges, not the Yamuna River. The restoration of smaller temples is accurate, but the incorrect river specification makes the statement false.  This detail tests the candidate's precise geographical knowledge.


Statement 2 is correct. The Mahakal Lok Corridor, while not explicitly part of the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, is a similar project that shares the characteristics described in the statement.  The description of its features and its impact on tourism and the economy are accurate.   This tests the candidate's understanding of broader development projects related to religious tourism.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the river connected to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and/or the relationship between the Kashi Vishwanath and Mahakal Lok Corridors. The question necessitates a thorough understanding of the projects and their geographical contexts.


**6. With reference to the Vishnupad Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vishnupad Temple, located in Gaya, Bihar, on the banks of the Falgu River, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and features his footprint, known as Dharmasila.
2. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu's footprint at the Vishnupad Temple marks the spot where he subdued the demon Gayasur, an event mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vishnupad Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, not Lord Shiva. The description of the footprint (Dharmasila) is accurate, but the incorrect deity creates a significant distractor. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific Hindu deities and their associated temples.


Statement 2 is correct. The mythological account of Lord Vishnu subduing Gayasur and the mention of the event in the Mahabharata and Ramayana are accurate.  This tests the candidate's familiarity with Hindu mythology and its connection to specific religious sites.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the deity associated with the Vishnupad Temple. The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of Hindu mythology and religious geography.



**7. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, was initially built in the 5th or 6th century during the late Gupta period and is built in the Dravidian style of architecture.
2. The Vajrasana (Diamond Throne) in the Mahabodhi Temple Complex marks the spot where Buddha attained enlightenment and is believed to be a direct descendant of the Bodhi tree.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mahabodhi Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, and the current structure dates back to the 5th or 6th century (late Gupta period), it is not built in the Dravidian style. Its architectural style is described as a unique blend,  not strictly Dravidian. This tests the candidate's knowledge of architectural styles and their precise application to specific monuments.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vajrasana marks the spot where Buddha meditated, not where he attained enlightenment. The Bodhi tree is located nearby, but the Vajrasana is a separate structure.  The subtle difference in the location and significance of these two elements creates a challenging statement. This tests the candidate's precise understanding of Buddhist symbolism and geography.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as both statements contain inaccuracies. The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex and Buddhist history.


**8. With reference to the Ratna Bhandar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ratna Bhandar, located on the southern side of the Jagamohana (assembly hall) in the Shree Jagannath Temple, comprises the Bahar Bhandar (outer chamber) and Bhitar Bhandar (inner chamber).
2. The Magji Ladoo, an offering at the Shree Jagannath Temple, received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, representing one of the ‘chappan bhog’ prasads.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ratna Bhandar is located on the *northern*, not southern, side of the Jagamohana. The description of its chambers is accurate, but the incorrect location makes the statement false. This tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the temple's layout.


Statement 2 is correct. The Magji Ladoo did receive a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, and it is indeed one of the ‘chappan bhog’ offerings at the Shree Jagannath Temple. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific cultural practices and regional products.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the location of the Ratna Bhandar. The question tests the candidate's specific knowledge of the Shree Jagannath Temple and its associated cultural elements.


**9. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, later Chola rulers, pursued a defensive military policy, focusing on internal consolidation rather than aggressive expansion.
2. Nagapattinam served as a key trading center for the Chola Empire, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia under their "Look East Policy," and Rajaraja I led a conquest of Maldives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I pursued an *aggressive* military policy, significantly expanding the Chola Empire's influence. The statement presents the opposite of the historical reality, creating a strong distractor.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the Chola Empire's military strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the description of transhumance is accurate, the statement incorrectly specifies that the nomadic tribes rear cattle and camels.  They primarily rear sheep and goats.  This subtle error requires precise knowledge of the livestock involved.


Statement 2 is correct. The UNESCO recognition of transhumance traditions in Europe and Switzerland in 2023 is accurate. This tests the candidate's awareness of international cultural heritage designations.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the livestock reared by nomadic tribes practicing transhumance.  The question successfully differentiates between a general understanding of transhumance and specific details about the practice.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MOW program was launched in 1992, the statement incorrectly lists the Ramayana and Mahabharata as included in the specific Asia-Pacific Register mentioned.  The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the contents of the register.


Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the register at the 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar is accurate. This tests the candidate's knowledge of recent developments in cultural heritage preservation.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the specific literary works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The question successfully tests the candidate's precise knowledge of cultural heritage preservation initiatives.


**12. With reference to the Jyotirmath (formerly Joshimath), consider the following statements:**

1. Jyotirmath, located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya to promote Advaita Vedanta philosophy and is known as the summer abode of Lord Badrinath.
2.  Adi Shankaracharya performed penance in Jyotirmath under a tree known as Amar Kalpavriksha and the renaming of Joshimath to Jyotirmath was approved by the Uttarakhand government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Jyotirmath is the *winter*, not summer, abode of Lord Badrinath. The description of its philosophical significance and location is accurate, but the seasonal designation is incorrect.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details about the location.


Statement 2 is correct. Both the penance performed by Adi Shankaracharya under the Amar Kalpavriksha and the government's approval of the renaming are accurate. This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical and recent events related to the location.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the seasonal designation of Jyotirmath as the abode of Lord Badrinath.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related facts.


**13. With reference to the Alagar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alagar Temple, located on the foothills of the Alagar hills in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is one of the 108 abodes of Lord Shiva, worshipped here in the name of Kallazhagar.
2.  The Alagar Temple is mentioned in the Tamil epic Silappadikaram and the hymns of the Alvars, and its mandapam pillars showcase Nayaka art style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alagar Temple is one of the 108 abodes of Lord *Vishnu*, not Shiva.  The name Kallazhagar is correct, but the incorrect deity creates a significant distractor. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific Hindu deities and their associated temples.


Statement 2 is correct. The mentions in Silappadikaram and Alvars' hymns, and the Nayaka art style of the mandapam pillars are accurate. This tests the candidate's knowledge of Tamil literature and art history.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the deity worshipped at the Alagar Temple.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of both religious and artistic aspects of the temple.


**14. With reference to the Sri Madhava Perumal Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. Inscriptions found at the largely submerged Sri Madhava Perumal Temple revealed a 1000-year-old trade route connecting the Kongu region with northern Karnataka and Kerala, crossing the River Cauvery.
2.  The Sri Madhava Perumal Temple, constructed in 1338 by Veera Siddha Keththaya Dhandanayaka, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and came under the rule of the Pandya dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The trade route crossed the Bhavani and Moyar rivers, not the Cauvery.  The timeframe and regions connected are accurate, but the river specification is incorrect.  This tests the candidate's precise geographical knowledge.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The temple is dedicated to Thondreeshwaramudiayar (Lord Shiva), not Lord Vishnu, and it came under the rule of the Hoysala, not Pandya, dynasty.  Both the deity and the ruling dynasty are misrepresented. This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical rulers and religious details.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain inaccuracies.  The question requires a detailed understanding of the historical context of the temple and its associated trade route.


**15. With reference to the Kesariya Stupa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kesariya Stupa, located in West Champaran, Bihar, is believed to be the tallest brick-built Buddhist stupa in the world and was built to commemorate the spot where Buddha gave his first sermon.
2.  Chinese travelers Fa-Hien and Hiuen Tsang mentioned the Kesariya Stupa in their accounts, and Buddha announced his impending death and previous existence as a ‘Chakravarti Raja’ at this stupa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kesariya Stupa is located in *East*, not West, Champaran, Bihar.  While it is considered the tallest, the specification of it being built to commemorate Buddha's first sermon is incorrect.  This tests the candidate's precise geographical and historical knowledge.


Statement 2 is correct. The mentions by Fa-Hien and Hiuen Tsang, and Buddha's announcements at the stupa are accurate. This tests the candidate's knowledge of historical accounts and Buddhist history.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the location of the Kesariya Stupa and the event commemorated by its construction.  The question requires detailed knowledge of Buddhist history and geography.



**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist ancient monuments deemed no longer of national importance, thereby allowing for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area.
2.  The AMASR Act explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" to address instances where protected monuments are untraceable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed empowers the Central Government to declare that a monument has ceased to be of national importance (Section 35). This delisting removes the monument from ASI protection and allows for construction and other activities. The delisting of "untraceable" monuments is a direct application of this provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that the term "Missing Monuments" does not exist within the AMASR Act; it was a term used by the CAG audit team.  The Act itself doesn't have a specific classification for untraceable monuments. The process of delisting addresses the issue of monuments no longer considered nationally significant, but it doesn't use the term "Missing Monuments".  The distinction is crucial for understanding the legal framework governing the protection and delisting of ancient monuments in India.  The absence of a defined term highlights the complexities in managing and protecting a vast and diverse heritage.


**2. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University was established in the 13th century CE, primarily focusing on the study of Vedic scriptures and traditional Indian arts.
2. The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was taken during the 2nd East Asia Summit in 2007, envisioning it as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The historical Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, and it flourished until its destruction in the 12th century CE. Its curriculum encompassed a much broader range of subjects than just Vedic scriptures and traditional arts, including Buddhism (various schools), medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy. The statement misrepresents the historical timeline and the scope of studies at the ancient university.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that the decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was a key outcome of the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) held in the Philippines in 2007. The vision for the new university explicitly included fostering inter-civilizational dialogue, reflecting a modern interpretation of the ancient institution's role.  This statement accurately reflects the genesis of the contemporary Nalanda University project.


**3. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" and were first presented in 1969.
2. The Directorate of Film Festivals has been administering the awards since 1973, with awards given across three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Film Awards were indeed initially called "State Awards," they were established in 1954, not 1969. The year 1969 marks the institution of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, a separate but significant award in Indian cinema. The confusion between these two awards creates a plausible distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of Indian cinema's award system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Directorate of Film Festivals assumed responsibility for administering the National Film Awards in 1973.  The three award categories mentioned (Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema) are accurately described. This statement demonstrates factual accuracy regarding the administrative and structural aspects of the National Film Awards.


**4. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, inaugurated in 2001, was shortlisted for the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in the Museums category.
2. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the UNESCO’s 2023 Prix Versailles Award in the Airports category.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was indeed shortlisted for the Prix Versailles Award, but it was inaugurated in 2022, not 2001. The 2001 date refers to the Gujarat earthquake, which the museum commemorates. This subtle error in the inauguration date is designed to test the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru was awarded the UNESCO’s 2023 Prix Versailles Award in the Airports category. This confirms the accuracy of the statement. The correct answer hinges on the candidate's knowledge of specific details associated with the award and the projects recognized.


**5.  With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is spearheaded by the Ministry of Agriculture, aiming to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by leveraging blockchain technology for improved traceability.
2. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) serves as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative does aim to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton and uses blockchain technology for traceability, it is spearheaded by the Ministry of Textiles, not the Ministry of Agriculture. This substitution of ministries creates a common point of confusion among candidates who may not be precisely familiar with the roles of different ministries in India.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly identifies the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) as the implementing agency for the initiative.  This fact is directly stated and demonstrates a clear understanding of the initiative's organizational structure.  The correct answer depends on the ability to recall the specific ministry involved and the implementing agency.


**6. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is an initiative of the Ministry of Home Affairs, implemented by the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) alone, to promote contemporary Indian art forms.
2. The project aims to democratize art through public installations in urban landscapes, showcasing diverse Indian art forms such as Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, and Bani Thani painting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Furthermore, the implementation is a joint effort between Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), not solely NGMA. The incorrect ministry and incomplete implementation details create a misleading statement that requires careful attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The project's aim to democratize art through public installations and the inclusion of diverse Indian art forms (like Thangka, Cheriyal, and Bani Thani paintings) are accurately described in the given text. This statement accurately reflects the project's goals and scope. The correct answer depends on the candidate's understanding of the project's organizational and artistic aspects.


**7. With reference to the  Memory of 2001 Gujarat Earthquake, consider the following statements:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill near Bhuj, houses one of the world’s largest Miyawaki forests and a fort built in 1723 by Rao Godji.
2. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake, with Bhuj as its epicenter, registered a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, its location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, the presence of a large Miyawaki forest, and the 1723 fort built by Rao Godji are all accurate details from the given text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The magnitude of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake is given as 7.9, not 7.7, in the provided text. This minor discrepancy in the magnitude is designed to test the candidate's precision and recall of numerical data. The correct answer depends on the candidate's ability to accurately recall the details of the earthquake and the museum.


**8. With reference to the  Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. Ruskin Bond was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for his significant contribution to Indian English literature, including works such as "Vagrants in the Valley" and "Once Upon a Monsoon Time."
2. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Akademi on a writer, reserved for writers who have made significant contributions to Indian literature in regional languages only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions Ruskin Bond's receipt of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship and lists some of his notable works.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the fellowship is the highest honor, it is not restricted to writers contributing only in regional languages.  Ruskin Bond's contribution is to Indian English literature, demonstrating that the fellowship is not limited by language.  This qualification in the second statement functions as a distractor, requiring the candidate to have precise knowledge of the award's criteria.  The subtle difference in the statement creates a challenging MCQ.


**9. With reference to the  International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha descended from the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Lumbini in Nepal.
2. The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observed IAD, celebrating the recent declaration of Pali as a classical language by the Cabinet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that Lord Buddha descended to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh, not Lumbini in Nepal. This change of location is a key detail that differentiates the correct answer from the incorrect one.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the Ministry of Culture's involvement in observing IAD and the celebration of Pali's status as a classical language.  The accurate recall of the location in statement 1 is crucial to selecting the correct option.


**10. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda primarily preached Advaita Vedanta philosophy, excluding other schools of Vedanta thought in his teachings.
2.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 significantly contributed to promoting Indian philosophy and spirituality to the Western world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda was a prominent exponent of Advaita Vedanta, the text indicates that his teachings also incorporated elements of other schools of Vedanta, such as Visistadvaita and Dvaita. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of his philosophical contributions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly highlights the importance of Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 and its impact on introducing Indian thought to the West.  The correct option relies on the candidate's precise knowledge of the scope of Vivekananda's philosophy and his impact on the global stage.


**1. With reference to the Khelo India program, consider the following statements:**

1.  The program exclusively focuses on identifying and nurturing elite-level athletes.
2.  The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program is a component of the Khelo India initiative, targeting school children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Khelo India program is designed to identify and develop athletes at both the grassroots and elite levels.  It's a multi-pronged approach, not solely focused on already established elite athletes.  The program aims to create a robust sporting ecosystem from the ground up, identifying talent early and providing opportunities for growth at various stages.

Statement 2 is correct. The KIRTI program is explicitly mentioned as a part of the Khelo India initiative, specifically targeting school children aged 9 to 18 years. This demonstrates the program's commitment to identifying young talent and fostering their development.  The inclusion of KIRTI highlights the broader scope of Khelo India beyond just supporting established athletes.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's Olympic performance:**

1.  India's medal tally in the Paris 2024 Olympics was its best-ever Olympic performance.
2.  India's performance in the 2022 Commonwealth Games and 2021 Summer Deaflympics contrasted positively with its Olympic performance in Paris 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the Paris 2024 Olympics performance was India's *third*-best Olympic performance, indicating that there have been better performances in previous Olympics. This highlights the inconsistency in India's Olympic results, despite improvements in other sporting events.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly contrasts India's relatively weaker showing in the Paris Olympics with its improved performances in the 2022 Commonwealth Games and 2021 Summer Deaflympics. This comparison underscores the need for a more consistent and improved performance across various international sporting events.  The contrast points to potential areas for improvement in India's Olympic preparation and strategy.


**3. With reference to the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), consider the following statements:**

1.  TOPS primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to India's top athletes.
2.  The scheme includes provisions for specialized equipment but excludes international exposure opportunities for athletes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While TOPS does provide funding, it's not solely focused on financial assistance. The scheme offers a comprehensive support system, encompassing specialized equipment, international exposure through participation in training camps and competitions, top-tier coaching, and a monthly allowance.  This holistic approach emphasizes a multifaceted development of the athletes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that TOPS provides "international exposure" as one of its key components. This is a crucial aspect of the scheme, allowing athletes to gain valuable experience and compete at the highest level.  The omission of international exposure in the statement misrepresents the scheme's comprehensive nature.


**4. With reference to the RESET Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RESET Programme is designed to provide employment opportunities for retired sportspersons aged 20-50 years.
2.  The program is solely focused on providing financial aid to retired athletes without skill development components.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RESET Programme aims to empower retired sportspersons (aged 20-50) by providing them with the knowledge and skills needed for career development and increased employability.  It's designed to help them transition into new careers, not just provide direct employment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The program's objective is to equip retired athletes with skills and knowledge, facilitating their transition into the workforce. It's not just about financial assistance; the emphasis is on empowerment through skill development and career guidance. The focus on "knowledge and skills" directly contradicts the claim of solely providing financial aid.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Indian Olympic Association (IOA):**

1.  The IOA was founded in 1927 and was immediately recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
2.  The IOA's primary function is to organize and host the Olympic Games in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the IOA was formed in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first president and was recognized by the IOC in the same year. This highlights the early establishment and international recognition of the IOA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IOA's main function is to coordinate with National Sports Federations to send Indian teams to the Olympics and other international games.  Hosting the Olympic Games is a separate undertaking, a much larger-scale project than the IOA's core responsibilities.  The statement confuses the IOA's role with that of a national Olympic organizing committee.


**6. With reference to Abhinav Bindra's achievements, consider the following statements:**

1.  Abhinav Bindra is the first Indian to win an individual gold medal at the Olympics.
2.  Bindra received the Olympic Order for his contributions to the development of shooting in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly credits Abhinav Bindra with securing India's first individual Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. This is a significant achievement in Indian sports history.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions Bindra receiving the Olympic Order, it states that the award was given for his "outstanding contributions to the Olympic movement," not specifically for contributions to shooting in India. The award recognizes his broader impact on the Olympic movement, not solely his contributions to a specific sport within India.  The statement misinterprets the scope of the award.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, resulting in the conquest of several regions.
2. Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center facilitating extensive maritime trade with Southeast Asian countries during the reign of Rajaraja I.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime power and influence.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Rajendra I's significant naval conquests in Southeast Asia, extending the Chola Empire's reach to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  His naval prowess and expansionist policies are well-documented in historical records. Statement 2 is also correct; Nagapattinam flourished as a major port city under the Cholas, serving as a vital hub for trade with Southeast Asian nations.  Its strategic location and the Chola's naval dominance in the Bay of Bengal facilitated extensive commercial interactions during the reigns of both Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, contributing significantly to the empire's economic prosperity.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the historical evidence. Option (d) is completely false, as both statements are supported by historical accounts.


**2. With reference to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), consider the following statements:**

1. ICOMOS, supported by Azerbaijan, spearheaded the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, focusing on the preservation of traditional pastoralist migration practices.
2. The initiative primarily aims to document and safeguard transhumance traditions in the European Alps, given their historical significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, correctly identifying ICOMOS as its leader and Azerbaijan as a supporting nation. The initiative aims to protect and preserve transhumance, a traditional practice of seasonal livestock migration involving human communities.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initiative recognizes the importance of European transhumance traditions,  its scope is much broader than just the European Alps.  The initiative acknowledges and considers transhumance practices globally, including those in regions like the Himalayas and other parts of Asia, as well as other parts of the world.  Therefore, option (a) is the only correct answer, as it correctly identifies the leadership of ICOMOS and the broader scope of the initiative.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the Panchatantra and the Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, alongside works from other Asian countries.
2.  The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, exclusively focuses on preserving and promoting the documentary heritage of nations within the Asia-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the inclusion of Indian literary manuscripts, including the Panchatantra and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, in UNESCO's MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This demonstrates the programme's recognition of significant cultural heritage across the Asia-Pacific region.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the MoW Programme was launched in 1992 and does indeed focus on preserving documentary heritage, its scope is global, not limited to the Asia-Pacific region.  It maintains international, regional, and national registers, encompassing a diverse range of documentary heritage from across the world. Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct, making (a) the appropriate choice.


**4. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram signifies the victory of the Indian freedom movement and the strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the Chola Empire.
2. The change of name is primarily intended to erase the colonial legacy associated with Port Blair and highlight the islands' role in contemporary strategic affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the reasons behind the renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram. Statement 1 correctly highlights the symbolic significance of the new name, connecting it to the Indian freedom struggle and the historical role of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a naval base during the Chola Empire.  Statement 2 is also correct, as the renaming is intended to move away from the colonial past, represented by the name Port Blair, and to emphasize the islands' contemporary strategic significance in India's geopolitical landscape.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as both statements are valid interpretations of the motivations behind the name change.


**5. With reference to the T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1.  The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, launched the T20 World Cup in 2007, establishing it as a premier international Twenty20 cricket championship.
2. India's victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup, held in the USA and West Indies, marked their third triumph in the tournament's history.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the origin and establishment of the T20 World Cup by the ICC, correctly stating its headquarters location and the year of its inception.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While India did win the 2024 T20 World Cup, this marked their *second* victory, not their third.  They previously won in 2007.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct option.  The discrepancy in Statement 2 serves as a significant distractor, requiring precise factual recall.


**6. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA, founded in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first president, coordinates with National Sports Federations to select and send Indian teams to the Olympic Games and other international sporting events.
2. India's aim to become a top-five sporting nation by 2047 is directly linked to its successful bid to host the 2036 Olympic Games.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately details the IOA's founding year, its first president, and its crucial role in coordinating India's participation in international sporting events, including the Olympics.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While India aims to be a top-five sporting nation by 2047 and is preparing to host the 2036 Olympics, the two are not directly causally linked.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 correctly highlights Mahatma Gandhi's significant contribution to the early development of anti-apartheid sentiment and organizing in South Africa. His activism and establishment of organizations like the Natal Indian Congress were crucial in laying the groundwork for future anti-apartheid movements.  However, Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While India did support the ANC, the primary role of the Indian government in the AAM involved severing trade relations with the apartheid regime in 1946, bringing the issue to the United Nations, and maintaining an ANC representative office in New Delhi from the 1960s onward.  Financial aid through a specific "AFRICA Fund" is not the most accurate description of India's main contributions.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely correct, making (a) the correct option.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it's inaccurate to state it's *primarily* practiced there and has minimal presence in the plains.  The practice also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, indicating a wider geographical distribution than the statement suggests. The statement oversimplifies the geographical spread of this traditional practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The seasonal movement of livestock in transhumance is influenced by various factors beyond just pasture availability.  Market access for selling livestock and livestock products plays a crucial role in determining migration routes and timing.  Other factors, such as water sources and security concerns, also influence the decisions of pastoral communities. The statement presents an oversimplified and incomplete picture of the factors driving transhumance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The reduction in the number of sports in the CWG 2026 edition, specifically the removal of established and popular sports, doesn't directly reflect a move towards greater inclusivity.  The decision is primarily driven by factors such as cost-cutting measures, venue availability, and the strategic focus of the organizing committee.  It's not necessarily aimed at promoting emerging sports, although this might be a secondary effect. The statement misinterprets the rationale behind the changes.

Statement 2 is correct. India's strong performance in the excluded sports (badminton, cricket, hockey, squash, table tennis, and wrestling) in the 2022 CWG contributed significantly to its overall medal tally.  Their removal will almost certainly reduce India's medal prospects in the 2026 edition, even if India performs well in the remaining sports.  The statement accurately points out the potential impact of these changes on India's medal count.



**5. With reference to the Apartheid system in South Africa, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The formal establishment of Apartheid in 1948 built upon a long history of racial discrimination and segregation in South Africa.  The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the enactment of various "pass laws" and other discriminatory legislation that restricted the movement and opportunities of Black Africans and other non-white populations.  Apartheid wasn't a sudden imposition but rather a culmination of existing oppressive structures. The statement accurately reflects this historical context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) was a highly successful *transnational* social movement.  It involved extensive international campaigns, mobilizing global support for sanctions against the Apartheid regime, and advocating for human rights in South Africa.  The movement's international reach was crucial to its success in ending Apartheid. The statement misrepresents the AAM's global character and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Nelson Mandela became a symbol of the struggle against Apartheid and played a key role in the armed wing of the ANC, his approach was not solely focused on armed resistance.  He was deeply influenced by Gandhian philosophy of non-violent resistance and actively participated in non-violent protests in the earlier stages of his activism.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of his political strategies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to Nelson Mandela in 1993, and India's conferral of the Bharat Ratna and the International Gandhi Peace Prize in 2001, are prominent examples of the international recognition of his efforts towards peace and human rights. These awards highlight his crucial role in ending Apartheid and promoting reconciliation in South Africa. The statement accurately cites examples of his international acclaim.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion, while centered in the Rajmahal Hills, was not a localized event with limited impact. It significantly impacted the British administration in the region, highlighting the widespread discontent among tribal populations due to exploitation and oppression. Karl Marx's reference to it as India's first organized mass revolution underscores its importance in the broader context of Indian resistance against colonial rule. The statement underestimates the rebellion's scope and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Santhal leaders displayed courage and organizational skills, it's inaccurate to say they used modern military tactics and weaponry. Their resistance was primarily based on traditional methods of warfare.  The statement attributes capabilities and resources to the rebels that they did not possess.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are *semi-subterranean* chamber tombs, not above-ground structures.  They are characterized by their partially underground construction, often involving a covered chamber for burial. The statement misrepresents the key physical characteristics of dolmenoid cists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Megalithic culture in India shows evidence of both settled agricultural communities and semi-nomadic groups.  The burial practices and other associated cultural elements found in megalithic sites indicate a diverse range of lifestyles and social organizations.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of the social organization associated with Megalithic cultures.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Phanigiri is not primarily associated with early Vedic culture.  It's a significant Buddhist site, known for its stupas, chaitya grihas, viharas, and other structures associated with Buddhist monastic life. The discovery of Satavahana and Ikshvaku period artifacts points to a historical period distinct from the Vedic era. The statement misidentifies the primary cultural affiliation of the site.

Statement 2 is correct.  Excavations at Phanigiri have revealed evidence suggesting the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects during the 2nd-3rd centuries AD.  This is indicated by the architectural features and other artifacts found at the site. The statement accurately reflects the findings of archaeological research at Phanigiri.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bavikonda Monastery is an important Buddhist site, describing it as "well-preserved" is an overstatement.  Years of neglect and insufficient maintenance have resulted in significant deterioration of the structures. Furthermore, it is primarily associated with Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana Buddhism. The statement misrepresents the site's preservation status and its primary Buddhist affiliation.

Statement 2 is correct. The name "Bavikonda" literally translates to "hill of wells," reflecting the presence of ancient water harvesting systems at the site.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Padma Awards are generally not conferred posthumously, there is a provision to make exceptions in cases where the contributions of a deceased individual are considered exceptionally significant. This reflects a recognition of the extraordinary nature of certain achievements, even if the recipient is no longer alive. The statement accurately reflects the policy regarding posthumous awards.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This reflects the relative ranking of these awards based on their significance and the level of bravery they recognize. The statement correctly lists the order of precedence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year—on Republic Day and Independence Day. This reflects the importance of recognizing bravery and valor throughout the year and on these nationally significant occasions. The statement incorrectly limits the announcement frequency.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gandhi Sarovar is not located near the Badrinath Temple. It's associated with the Kedarnath Temple and originates from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier in Uttarakhand. The statement incorrectly places the lake in relation to another pilgrimage site within the Char Dham circuit.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kedarnath Temple is indeed one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva and is located in Uttarakhand, forming part of the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit along with Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Badrinath. The statement accurately describes the location and significance of the Kedarnath Temple.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is located at the confluence of not just two, but five rivers: Krishna, Bhavansi, Veni, Tunga, and Bhadra. The confluence of multiple rivers is a key aspect of the temple's significance. The statement understates the number of rivers involved.

Statement 2 is correct.  Apart from the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, other such temples are indeed found in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, indicating the widespread reverence for this deity across different regions. The statement accurately identifies the geographical spread of Sangameshwar temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ambubachi Mela at the Kamakhya Temple commemorates the annual menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, symbolizing fertility and renewal. It's not directly related to rice harvesting, although the themes of fertility and abundance are present in both. The statement misrepresents the central theme of the Ambubachi Mela.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is a unique fusion of styles, incorporating elements of the Nilachal style, with influences from Upper Burma and the Pala style of Bengal, ultimately evolving into aspects of the Ahom style.  This architectural blend reflects the historical and cultural interactions in the region. The statement accurately describes the temple's architectural characteristics.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Both were part of a broader network of revolutionary activities aiming to challenge British rule.  Several individuals were involved in both events, highlighting the interconnectedness of these movements. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of the relationship between these events.

Statement 2 is correct. Jatin Das's death during a hunger strike in the Lahore Conspiracy Case did indeed provoke strong public reaction and widespread protests across India. This event became a powerful symbol of the harsh treatment of political prisoners and the struggle for greater freedom and rights. The statement accurately describes the impact of Jatin Das's death.

The statement incorrectly limits the use of this mudra.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bhumisparsha Mudra accurately depicts the moment when the Buddha called upon the earth to witness his enlightenment and overcome the temptations and challenges presented by Mara.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India-US Cultural Property Agreement is designed to *prevent* the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities, not to facilitate their sale and export.  It aims to curb the illegal flow of cultural artifacts from India to the United States.  The statement misrepresents the agreement's primary goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is a key partner, the implementing agency for Kasturi Cotton Bharat is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL).  This highlights the collaborative nature of the initiative, involving various stakeholders in the cotton value chain. The Cotton Corporation's role is primarily related to procurement and quality control, not the overall implementation of the branding and traceability program.

2.  The benefits of declaring a language as classical include the establishment of professional chairs in central universities and the awarding of two major annual awards for scholars in that language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "original literary tradition" criterion was indeed part of the initial criteria set by the LEC. However, this criterion was *dropped* in the revised 2024 criteria because the LEC found it difficult to objectively assess and prove or disprove the originality of literary traditions.  This adjustment reflects a more practical approach to the evaluation process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The declaration of a language as a classical language in India brings several benefits, including the establishment of dedicated centers for the study of that language and the encouragement (by the UGC) of the establishment of professional chairs in central universities.  Furthermore, two major annual awards are provided for scholars of the designated classical language, promoting academic excellence and research in that field.


**4. With reference to Pali language and its literature, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Tipitaka is structured into three sections: Vinaya Pitaka (Discipline Basket), Sutta Pitaka (Sayings Basket), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (Buddhist philosophy).  The Sutta Pitaka contains only discourses and sermons of Buddha himself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Pali is indeed closely related to Magadhi Prakrit and is the language of the Theravada Buddhist canon, including works like the Dhammapada and Jataka Tales, the statement incorrectly mentions four baskets in the Tipitaka. The Tipitaka is divided into three, not four, baskets.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Tipitaka is correctly described as consisting of the Vinaya Pitaka (rules and discipline), the Sutta Pitaka (discourses and sermons, including those attributed to the Buddha but also other religious poetry), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (Buddhist philosophy).  However, the Sutta Pitaka is not limited only to the discourses and sermons of the Buddha himself, but also includes other religious poetry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the Abhaya Mudra does symbolize fearlessness and is associated with Amoghasiddhi, the description of its association with taming a mad elephant is correct. However, the Bhumisparsha Mudra does *not* represent the preaching of the Dhamma; it represents calling the earth to witness during Shakyamuni Buddha's meditation. The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra is the one that represents the preaching of the Dhamma.

Statement 2 is correct. The Dhyana Mudra accurately represents meditation, balance, tranquility, and the resting of the senses.  The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra (turning the wheel) symbolizes the preaching of the Dhamma, while the Bhumisparsha Mudra symbolizes calling the earth to witness.


**6. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

2.  The agreement restricts the importation into the United States of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) plays a crucial role in the coordination and recovery of traced antiquities within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The agreement's primary goal is to curb the illegal flow of Indian antiquities to the USA and to expedite their return to India if seized. However, it's crucial to note that while the agreement is bilateral, it operates within the broader framework of international conventions related to cultural heritage protection, such as the 1970 UNESCO Convention.  The agreement strengthens existing international efforts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The agreement explicitly restricts the import of specific categories of Indian archaeological and ethnological materials into the USA.  The ASI's role in coordinating and recovering traced antiquities within India is a critical aspect of national efforts to combat illicit trafficking.  This highlights the importance of domestic collaboration in conjunction with international agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While National Handloom Day does indeed commemorate the Swadeshi Movement's launch on August 7, 1905, and aims to honor handloom weavers, the first National Handloom Day was celebrated in 2015, not 2016. This is a minor chronological inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian handloom sector is accurately described as the country's largest cottage industry and a major employment source, especially for women. The statistic of approximately 70% female participation in the workforce within the handloom sector is widely accepted.


**8. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

2.  Eri silk is obtained from the Philosamia ricini silkworm, which is reared indoors 5-6 times a year and is known for its unique production method where the moth is allowed to exit the cocoon naturally, making it a vegan silk.  India produces all five types of silk.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of Eri silk production is inaccurate; the moth is *not* killed to harvest the silk.  The unique characteristic of Eri silk is that the moth is allowed to emerge naturally, making it a vegan silk. The statement also incorrectly states that India produces only four types of silk; in reality, India produces all five types.

Statement 2 is correct and accurately describes the production of Eri silk, highlighting its vegan nature due to the non-lethal harvesting method.  The statement also correctly mentions that India produces all five major types of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tropical Tasar, Temperate Tasar, and Muga.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Genetic evidence strongly suggests interbreeding between Denisovans and both Neanderthals and modern humans. Their geographic range also encompassed a wider area than just Siberia, extending to Southeast Asia during the last Ice Age.

Statement 2 is correct.  It accurately depicts the close relationship of Denisovans to both Neanderthals and modern humans, the evidence of interbreeding, and their broader geographic range during the last Ice Age.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Kakori Conspiracy did involve the mentioned individuals, the execution date for Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru in the Lahore Conspiracy Case is incorrect; they were executed in 1931, not 1930.

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately describes the outcomes of the Kakori Conspiracy, including the death sentences. It also correctly highlights the use of courtroom tactics and hunger strikes as methods of resistance employed during the Lahore Conspiracy Case.  Jatin Das's death during a hunger strike is a significant event related to this form of protest.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  It understates Mahatma Gandhi's significant contribution to the AAM in South Africa.  While the founding of the Natal Indian Congress and the publication of Indian Opinion are accurate, his role extended far beyond these events, including leading the 1906 boycott of registration certificates and establishing the Phoenix Settlement.  Furthermore, the Indian government's involvement began much earlier than the 1960s.

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately highlights Gandhi's foundational role and the Indian government's early and significant actions in severing trade relations and providing support to the AAM.  The mention of the 1906 boycott and the early support demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of India's contribution.


**14. With reference to the role of the United Nations in the South African Anti-Apartheid Struggle, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN's involvement stemmed from South Africa's Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act of 1946 and included imposing diplomatic and economic sanctions, declaring apartheid a crime against humanity, and legitimizing resistance movements.  The UN established the Special Committee against Apartheid in 1962 and the Centre against Apartheid in 1975.
2. The UN's actions were primarily triggered by South Africa's Group Areas Act in the 1950s.  The UN's key responses included imposing sanctions, declaring apartheid a crime against humanity, and actively supporting anti-apartheid movements.

To focus solely on these two aspects is to ignore the depth and breadth of his early work.

Statement 2 is accurate.  Gandhi's influence on the AAM extended beyond his establishment of the Phoenix Settlement.  He directly led Satyagrahis in various boycotts against discriminatory legislation, including the 1906 legislation mentioned.  His leadership in these direct actions showcases his commitment to challenging racial discrimination and his utilization of Satyagraha as a powerful tool for social and political change.  The statement correctly highlights a crucial aspect of his direct involvement in the South African struggle.

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a non-violent protest lasting 604 days, was initiated on March 30, 1924, to challenge the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple in Travancore.
2.  The movement solely relied on the efforts of lower-caste individuals, particularly Ezhavas, demonstrating their determination to overcome social discrimination and achieve temple entry, without support from other communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 correctly describes the Vaikom Satyagraha's core features. The dates, the location, the nature of the protest (non-violent), and the objective (challenging discriminatory temple entry practices) are all accurate.  The statement effectively summarizes the key elements of the Satyagraha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ezhavas were significantly involved and the movement primarily aimed to address their plight, the Vaikom Satyagraha received support from various communities and individuals.  The involvement of other castes and even members of other religions highlights the broad-based nature of the movement and its appeal beyond a single community.

It explicitly covers the preservation of ancient and historical monuments, archaeological sites, and remains of national importance. This broad definition ensures the protection of a wide range of heritage assets, reflecting their significance within the historical and cultural narrative.

Statement 2 is correct.  While the "untraceability" of some monuments might be a factor considered during the evaluation, the decision to delist a monument is based on a thorough assessment of its national importance. This assessment considers various factors such as historical significance, architectural merit, and overall contribution to the country's heritage. The process aims to ensure that only those monuments that truly lack national significance are delisted.

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the unrestricted flow of antiquities between India and the USA, promoting cultural exchange.
2. The CPA is intended to prevent and curb the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA, aiding in the repatriation of stolen artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPA's purpose is not to facilitate the unrestricted flow of antiquities.  Instead, it aims to regulate and restrict the import of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin into the USA. This restriction is aimed at preventing the illegal trade in antiquities.  The agreement's focus on restriction is crucial in understanding its role in protecting India's cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is correct. The CPA is designed to combat the illegal trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA.  By restricting imports, it aims to deter the illegal trade and facilitate the return of stolen artifacts to India. This objective is aligned with international efforts to protect cultural heritage and combat illicit trafficking. The agreement’s focus on repatriation is a key element in understanding its impact on international cooperation in protecting cultural heritage.



**1. With reference to ancient Indian universities, consider the following statements:**

1. Vikramshila University, renowned for its Buddhist studies, was established in the 8th century CE by the Pala ruler Dharmapala.
2. Nagarjunakonda, a significant center of Mahayana Buddhism, is now located in Odisha and was named after the philosopher Nagarjuna, known for his contributions to Madhyamika philosophy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Vikramshila University was indeed a renowned center for Buddhist studies and was established during the Pala dynasty, it was founded by Gopal I, not Dharmapala. Dharmapala was a later Pala ruler who further expanded the university. The date is also slightly off; it was established in the 8th century but not specifically the early 8th century.

Statement 2 is incorrect on multiple counts. Nagarjunakonda is indeed associated with Mahayana Buddhism and named after Nagarjuna, a significant figure in Mahayana thought.  However, Nagarjunakonda is located in Andhra Pradesh, not Odisha. Furthermore, Nagarjuna is primarily associated with Madhyamika (not Sunyavada), a school of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy emphasizing emptiness.  The subtle difference in philosophical terminology highlights the need for precise recall in UPSC-style questions.  The conflation of these details demonstrates the potential for distractors in such questions.


**2. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is annually submerged in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.
2. The name "Sangameshwar" signifies the confluence of seven rivers, including the Krishna and Bhavani, along with five other tributaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  The detail about the annual submergence due to the Srisailam dam is accurate.  This subtle but significant error in the deity's identity serves as a strong distractor, emphasizing the importance of precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct.  The name "Sangameshwar" accurately reflects the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavani rivers, along with five other tributaries—Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi, and Malapaharini. This detail, while seemingly minor, is crucial for demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the temple's geographical and historical context.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Kamakhya Temple:**

1. The Ambubachi Mela, a festival commemorating the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, is celebrated at the Kamakhya Temple located on the Nilachal hills in Odisha.
2. The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is primarily influenced by the Pala style of Bengal, integrated with elements from Upper Burma, evolving into the Ahom style of architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ambubachi Mela is correctly associated with the Kamakhya Temple and its symbolic interpretation, the temple is located in Assam, not Odisha.  This geographical error is a common distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of regional locations in India.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Kamakhya Temple's architecture reflects a blend of influences, primarily from the Pala style of Bengal, with elements from Upper Burma (due to Tai migration), later developing into the Ahom style. The description accurately captures the complex architectural evolution of the temple.


**4. With reference to the Lothal archaeological site, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lothal is indeed a significant Indus Valley Civilization site located in Gujarat. However, it is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers, not the Sabarmati and Mahi. This seemingly minor geographical detail is a key distractor, testing precise knowledge of the site's location.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal is significant evidence of advanced maritime technology and understanding of shipbuilding during the Indus Valley Civilization. This fact highlights the technological sophistication of the civilization.


**5.  With reference to the  Jyotirmath (Joshimath), consider the following statements:**

1. Jyotirmath, located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Ramanujacharya,  a proponent of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta philosophy.
2. Jyotirmath is known as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath and serves as a base camp for mountaineers attempting to climb the Nanda Devi peak.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jyotirmath's location and its status as one of the four cardinal mathas are accurate, it was established by Adi Shankaracharya, a proponent of Advaita Vedanta, not Ramanujacharya, who is associated with Vishishtadvaita Vedanta.  The substitution of these two prominent figures in Indian philosophy creates a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Jyotirmath serves as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath and is a base camp for mountaineers attempting to ascend Nanda Devi.  This factual information highlights the site's religious and geographical significance.


**6. Consider the following statements about the  Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema, is presented annually by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
2.  The award was instituted in 1969 to commemorate the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, considered the father of Indian cinema, and includes a cash prize and a Golden Lotus medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed India's highest award in cinema, but it's presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. This substitution of government bodies is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The details regarding the institution of the award in 1969 to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary, the inclusion of a cash prize and a Golden Lotus medallion, are all accurate.  This information tests factual recall related to Indian cinema history.


**7. With reference to the  Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan script, written in a boustrophedon style, has been successfully deciphered, revealing insights into their religious beliefs and social structures.
2. Evidence suggests that the Harappans engaged in extensive trade with Mesopotamia, exporting goods such as grain, jewelry, and pottery, and importing copper and precious stones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harappan script, while written in a boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), remains undeciphered. This presents a significant challenge for historians trying to fully understand the civilization.  The statement's claim of successful decipherment is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological evidence strongly supports the existence of extensive trade between the Harappan Civilization and Mesopotamia.  The list of exports and imports mentioned accurately reflects the nature of this trade.  This demonstrates the civilization's interconnectedness and economic activity.


**8. With reference to the  National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC, being developed at Lothal under the Sagarmala Programme, aims to showcase India's maritime heritage from the Mughal period to the present day.
2. The NMHC project is a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMHC at Lothal does showcase India's maritime heritage, its scope extends far beyond the Mughal period, encompassing a much broader historical timeframe, including ancient periods.  Restricting the timeframe to the Mughal period is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMHC project at Lothal is indeed a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative undertaken by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways. This reflects current government policies related to infrastructure development.


**9.  Consider the following statements about the  Megalithic culture of India:**

1.  The megalithic culture, characterized by dolmenoid cists and other monumental stone structures, is primarily associated with the Neolithic period in Indian history.
2.  Megalithic burial sites reveal evidence of a sedentary lifestyle, with communities inhabiting defined territorial boundaries and establishing permanent settlements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed characteristic of the megalithic culture in India. While the megalithic period spans a considerable timeframe, it is largely associated with the late Neolithic and early Iron Age periods.  The statement's focus on the Neolithic period is not entirely inaccurate given the overlap.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The megalithic culture is associated with a semi-nomadic or at least mobile lifestyle, not a strictly sedentary one. The communities did not always inhabit defined territorial boundaries, unlike later settled agricultural societies. The description of a sedentary lifestyle is a misleading distractor.


**10. With reference to the  Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Shree Jagannath Temple's Ratna Bhandar, a sacred treasury containing jewels and other valuable objects, was reopened in 2024 after being sealed for over 50 years.
2. The temple's architecture exemplifies the Kalinga style, a distinct substyle of Nagara architecture, featuring components such as the Vimana (Deula), Jagamohana, Natamandapa, and Bhogamandapa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the reopening of the Ratna Bhandar is a recent event,  the timeframe of its closure is slightly off; it was reopened after 46 years, not over 50. This minor discrepancy in the duration is a subtle distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Shree Jagannath Temple's architecture accurately reflects its Kalinga style, a substyle of Nagara architecture, with its distinct components.  This factual information tests knowledge of temple architecture styles.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories significantly expanded Chola influence across the Bay of Bengal, including the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2. Rajendra I's reign witnessed the Chola navy's farthest reach, culminating in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly impacting the Sailendra Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval expansion under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I's naval prowess is well-documented, leading to the conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, establishing Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal.  His control over sea routes boosted trade and projected power.  Rajendra I, his successor, continued this aggressive naval policy, extending Chola power even further. His expedition to Southeast Asia resulted in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, impacting the Sailendra Empire.  This demonstrates the Chola navy's remarkable range and military capabilities, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake" and influencing trade and power dynamics in Southeast Asia.  The options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the significant naval achievements of both rulers.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is a traditional pastoral practice primarily confined to mountainous regions, involving the seasonal migration of livestock and human communities between high-altitude summer pastures and lower-altitude winter grazing lands.
2.  While prevalent in the Himalayas, the transhumance practice is absent in the plains of India, due to the year-round availability of suitable grazing lands in these regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes transhumance as a seasonal livestock movement practiced by nomadic communities, particularly in mountainous regions.  The migration is driven by the need to access different grazing lands suited to varying seasons. The practice is associated with specific communities who move their herds between high-altitude summer pastures and lower-altitude winter grazing lands. Statement 2 is incorrect. Transhumance is not limited to mountainous regions.  While it is prominent in the Himalayas, impacting communities like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it also exists in the plains of India, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The presence of transhumance in these diverse regions indicates its adaptability and prevalence beyond solely mountainous terrain.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register exclusively includes manuscripts and literary works from the Asia-Pacific region, excluding any works from other parts of the world.
2. The inclusion of three Indian literary works – Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana – in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register reflects the rich literary heritage of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, it doesn't exclude works from outside the region. The MOW program has international, regional, and national registers, allowing for a broader inclusion of significant documents and literary works globally. Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana highlights the recognition of India's significant contribution to global literature and its preservation efforts. The selection process prioritizes works demonstrating cultural and historical importance, and the inclusion of these Indian works underscores their enduring legacy.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope of the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register or fail to recognize the significance of the inclusion of the Indian literary works.


**4. With reference to Megalithic sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic monument, are exclusively found in the southern states of India, characterized by their semi-subterranean chamber tomb structures.
2.  Megalithic cultures in India exhibited a semi-nomadic lifestyle, with burial practices reflecting beliefs about death and the afterlife, often accompanied by grave goods and pottery offerings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While dolmenoid cists are a type of megalithic monument and are semi-subterranean chamber tombs, they are not exclusively found in southern India.  Megalithic sites are spread across various regions of India, including Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu.  Statement 2 is correct. Megalithic cultures across India, evidenced by their burial practices, demonstrated a semi-nomadic lifestyle.  The construction of megalithic structures, along with the inclusion of grave goods and pottery, provides insights into their beliefs about death and the afterlife.  The presence of these artifacts suggests a level of social organization and ritualistic practices associated with burial customs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they inaccurately represent the geographical distribution of dolmenoid cists or the lifestyle and beliefs of megalithic cultures.


**5. With reference to the Phanigiri archaeological site in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. Phanigiri, meaning "snake hood hillock," is primarily known for its association with the Ikshvaku dynasty, evidenced by the discovery of a coin hoard and other artifacts from this period.
2.  The archaeological excavations at Phanigiri have unearthed only structures associated with the Hinayana sect of Buddhism, indicating the exclusive dominance of this sect in the region during that period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Phanigiri's name, meaning "snake hood hillock," reflects its geographical features.  The discovery of a coin hoard belonging to the Ikshvaku period is a significant finding, confirming its historical association with this dynasty. Other artifacts unearthed further support this connection. Statement 2 is incorrect. Phanigiri's excavations have revealed structures associated with both Mahayana and Hinayana sects of Buddhism, indicating the co-existence of these sects in the region.  The presence of both sects demonstrates religious diversity during that period. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the findings at Phanigiri regarding its historical association with the Ikshvaku dynasty and the religious diversity present.


**6. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located near Visakhapatnam, Bavikonda Monastery is a significant Theravada Buddhist complex dating back to the 3rd century BCE, featuring structures like a Mahastupa, Chaitya Griha, and Acharya Vihara.
2.  Bavikonda Monastery's name, meaning "hill of wells," reflects its historical function as a major water reservoir for the surrounding region, crucial for sustaining a large monastic community.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Bavikonda Monastery as a significant Theravada Buddhist complex near Visakhapatnam, dating back to the 3rd century BCE.  The structures mentioned – Mahastupa, Chaitya Griha, and Acharya Vihara – are typical features of such complexes. Statement 2 is incorrect while the name "Bavikonda" does translate to "hill of wells,"  the primary function of these wells was not as a large-scale water reservoir for the region.  Instead, they likely served the immediate needs of the monastery. The wells provided a water source for the monastic community, not necessarily for the broader surrounding area.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the historical function of the wells at Bavikonda or the overall significance of the monastery.


**7. With reference to the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ooragutta site, an Iron Age megalithic site, is characterized by the presence of numerous dolmenoid cists, which are semi-subterranean chamber tombs, and a variety of grave goods.
2.  The rock art sites at Damaratogu in Gundala mandal feature depictions of both humans and animals, alongside weapons, providing insights into the daily life and activities of the communities who created them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies Ooragutta as an Iron Age megalithic site.  It is associated with megalithic monuments, including dolmenoid cists. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The rock art at Damaratogu in Gundala mandal primarily features depictions of animals, and notably *lacks* human figures or representations of weapons. This absence of human figures and weapons contrasts with many other rock art sites in the region. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2 regarding the content of the Damaratogu rock art.


**8. With reference to the prehistoric rock paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, predominantly feature linear representations of animals and stick-like human figures, primarily in green and dark red pigments.
2. Rock paintings from the Mesolithic period are characterized by a shift towards more naturalistic depictions of animals and a stylistic representation of humans, with scenes of hunting and community dances becoming more prominent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the characteristics of prehistoric rock paintings from different periods in India.  Upper Paleolithic paintings show simpler, linear representations, with animals and basic human forms being common subjects. The use of green and dark red pigments is also typical. Mesolithic paintings exhibit a greater level of detail and naturalism in animal depictions, while human figures are often depicted in a more stylized manner. Scenes of hunting and community dances become more frequent, providing glimpses into social life and activities. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they do not fully capture the evolution of artistic styles and themes in Indian prehistoric rock art across the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods.


**9. With reference to the history of Srikakulam, consider the following statements:**

1.  Srikakulam, formerly known as Chicacole, has a continuous history traceable back to the Kalinga Dynasty (3rd century BCE), with subsequent rule under various empires such as the Gajapati Kingdom, Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, Kakatiya, and Vijayanagara Empires.
2.  Srikakulam's cultural heritage includes not only Buddhist and Jain sites like Salihundam and Danthapuri, but also significant Hindu temples such as Srimukhalingam, Srikurmam, and Arasavilli, reflecting a rich confluence of religious traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of Srikakulam's history and cultural heritage.  Its history extends back to the Kalinga Dynasty, and it was subsequently part of several significant empires, showcasing its strategic importance and its position within broader historical narratives.  The region's cultural landscape demonstrates a blending of religious traditions, encompassing Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu sites.  The presence of these diverse religious sites reflects the region's rich and layered history, demonstrating the interplay of different faiths and cultures over time. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully encompass the richness of Srikakulam's historical and religious heritage.


**10. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its association with Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) between the Mauryan Empire and Kalinga, resulted in the annexation of Kalinga and led to Emperor Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, significantly impacting the religious landscape of the region.
2.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, built around the 2nd century BCE by King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty, primarily served as Jain monastic complexes, featuring inscriptions that highlight his reign and patronage of Jainism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect historical events and the significance of Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves. The Kalinga War resulted in the Mauryan annexation of Kalinga and Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, a pivotal event in Indian history.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, built during the reign of Kharavela, showcase the architectural and religious significance of the period.  These caves demonstrate Kharavela's patronage of Jainism, reflecting the religious practices prevalent at the time. Inscriptions within the caves provide valuable insights into his reign and governance.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not fully capture the historical significance of both the Kalinga War and the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves.


**11. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IVC, a Bronze Age civilization, is characterized by its advanced town planning, including a grid pattern layout with well-developed drainage systems, and the use of standardized weights and measures, suggesting a high degree of organization and trade.
2.  Religious practices in the IVC included the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), and a female deity, the Mother Goddess, as well as evidence of phallus (Linga) worship, but there is no evidence of the construction of temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key features of the Indus Valley Civilization. The IVC's sophisticated town planning, including grid patterns and drainage systems, is well-documented, reflecting advanced urban design and engineering. The use of standardized weights and measures points to a complex system of trade and commerce. Regarding religious practices, evidence suggests the worship of both male and female deities, with Pasupati and the Mother Goddess being prominent figures. Evidence also points to phallus (Linga) worship.  However, the absence of large-scale temple structures is also a notable characteristic of the civilization. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not fully encompass the key features of the IVC's urban planning, trade, and religious practices.


**12. With reference to Lothal and the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC), consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), is known for its well-preserved dockyard, providing evidence of advanced maritime technology and shipbuilding capabilities during the Bronze Age.
2. The NMHC at Lothal, developed under the Sagarmala Programme, aims to showcase India's maritime heritage, focusing primarily on the post-independence period and the development of modern naval technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope of the NMHC or the historical significance of Lothal's dockyard.


**13. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. Established by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince, the Ahom Dynasty's administration was characterized by a strong centralized monarchy, with the king holding absolute power and minimal influence from a council of ministers.
2.  Despite adopting Shaivism and the Shakti movement, the Ahom Dynasty's cultural influence was primarily confined to the Brahmaputra Valley, with limited impact on other regions of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom kings held significant power, the administration wasn't solely a centralized monarchy.  A council of ministers (Patra Mantris) played a crucial role, and their concurrence was essential for appointing a king.  This demonstrates a more nuanced system of governance than a purely centralized monarchy. Statement 2 is partially correct. The Ahom Dynasty's cultural influence was largely centered in the Brahmaputra Valley.  While they adopted and patronized Shaivism and the Shakti movement, their wider impact on other Indian regions was limited compared to other major dynasties.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of Ahom administration or overstate their cultural influence beyond the Brahmaputra Valley.


**14. With reference to Kozhikode's recognition as India's first UNESCO City of Literature, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is located on the Malabar Coast and was a significant center for the spice trade, attracting traders from various parts of the world for over 500 years, contributing to its rich literary and cultural heritage.
2.  The UNESCO City of Literature designation for Kozhikode is primarily based on its rich tradition of oral literature, with minimal written literary output, making it a unique example of a predominantly oral literary tradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Kozhikode's location, its historical importance as a spice trading center, and its contribution to its rich literary and cultural heritage.  The long history of trade and interaction with diverse cultures enriched its literary traditions. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Kozhikode's literary heritage is not solely based on oral traditions.  While oral traditions played a role, it also has a significant body of written literature.  The UNESCO designation recognizes a broader literary heritage encompassing both oral and written forms. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the nature of Kozhikode's literary heritage or incorrectly state the basis of its UNESCO designation.


**15. With reference to the 2024 T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, organizes the T20 World Cup, a premier international Twenty20 cricket championship.
2. The 2024 T20 World Cup final was held in the USA, marking the first time this tournament was held outside of traditional cricket-playing nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the ICC as the organizer of the T20 World Cup and its headquarters' location.  The ICC is the global governing body for cricket. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2024 T20 World Cup final was held jointly in the USA and West Indies, not solely in the USA.  This was not the first time the tournament was held outside traditional cricket-playing nations; it has been held in various locations globally. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 2 regarding the location of the 2024 T20 World Cup final.


**16. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram signifies the victory of the Indian freedom movement and highlights the A&N Islands' unique contribution to the struggle for independence.
2.  The change of name also reflects a deliberate effort to erase the colonial legacy associated with the previous name, Port Blair, and to emphasize the A&N Islands' strategic importance in contemporary geopolitical contexts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the reasons behind the renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram.  The new name aims to commemorate the Indian freedom struggle and the islands' role in it, particularly emphasizing Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's activities there.  Simultaneously, the renaming serves to replace the colonial legacy associated with the name "Port Blair" and to underscore the contemporary strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to fully account for the multifaceted reasons behind this name change, which seeks to acknowledge both historical and contemporary significance.


**17. With reference to the National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1. National Handloom Day is observed annually on August 7th to commemorate the launch of the Swadeshi Movement in 1905, which promoted the use of Indian-made goods, including handloom textiles.
2.  The handloom industry in India is predominantly a rural-based industry, employing a significant number of women, making it crucial for rural livelihoods and economic empowerment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly highlight aspects of National Handloom Day and the Indian handloom industry.  August 7th was chosen to commemorate the Swadeshi Movement's launch, which emphasized the importance of supporting Indian-made products, including handloom textiles. The handloom industry's significance in rural India, particularly its employment of women, underscores its role in rural livelihoods and economic empowerment.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully capture the importance of National Handloom Day in commemorating the Swadeshi Movement and the socioeconomic relevance of the handloom industry in India.


**18. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is unique as it is considered the world's only vegan silk because the silkworm is not killed during the production process, allowing it to emerge naturally from the cocoon.
2.  Eri silk is produced by the multivoltine silkworm Philosamia ricini, which can be reared indoors, enabling multiple harvests per year, making it a sustainable and commercially viable option.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key characteristics of Eri silk.  Its vegan status stems from the non-lethal harvesting method, which allows the moth to emerge from the cocoon naturally. This contrasts with traditional silk production where the silkworm is killed.  Eri silk's production by the multivoltine silkworm Philosamia ricini, and its suitability for indoor rearing, makes it a sustainable and commercially viable option with multiple harvests annually. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully encapsulate the unique features of Eri silk production and its sustainable aspects.


**19. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

1. Denisovans, an extinct hominin species, are known primarily through genetic evidence, with limited fossil remains discovered so far, primarily in Siberia and Tibet.
2.  Genetic studies suggest that Denisovans interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans, contributing to the genetic diversity of some present-day populations, particularly those in Asia and Oceania.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key aspects of Denisovans.  Our knowledge of Denisovans is largely based on genetic analysis of limited fossil remains discovered in locations like Siberia and Tibet.  Genetic studies have shown evidence of interbreeding between Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans, contributing to the genetic makeup of some present-day populations, particularly in parts of Asia and Oceania.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not fully represent the current scientific understanding of Denisovans, their limited fossil record, and the evidence of interbreeding with other hominin species.


**1. With reference to the Olympic Games, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece in the 8th century BCE, in honor of the Greek god Zeus.  The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece.
2.  The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger), and the Olympic flag features five interlocking rings representing the five continents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but inaccurate in its detail. While the Olympic Games did originate in ancient Greece in the 8th century BCE in honor of Zeus, the *first modern* Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, not in Paris.  The statement conflates the ancient and modern games.  The ancient games were discontinued for centuries before their revival.

Statement 2 is entirely correct. The Olympic motto is indeed "Citius, Altius, Fortius," and the five interlocking rings on the Olympic flag symbolize the five continents (Africa, Asia, America, Europe, and Oceania) participating in the Games.  This is widely known and easily verifiable.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Option (b) is the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the historical context of the Olympic Games' origin and the accuracy of the provided details about the motto and flag.


**2. With reference to the Commonwealth Games (CWG), consider the following statements:**

1. The Commonwealth Games were first held in 1930 in London, England, and are held every four years, featuring a rotating host city.
2.  The 2022 Commonwealth Games saw India win a significant number of medals across various disciplines, including badminton, cricket, hockey, and wrestling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the inaugural location. The first Commonwealth Games were held in Hamilton, Canada, in 1930, not London, England. While the games are held every four years with a rotating host city, the initial part of the statement is factually flawed.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham did see India win a substantial number of medals across a range of sports, including those mentioned (badminton, cricket, hockey, and wrestling). This is a matter of public record and easily verifiable.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of the information presented in statement 1 regarding the first games' location.


**3. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a non-violent protest, began in 1925 in the princely state of Travancore (present-day Kerala), focusing on the right to education for lower-caste Hindus.
2.  The Satyagraha, led by prominent figures like Mahatma Gandhi and E.V. Ramasamy Naicker, lasted for over 500 days and resulted in immediate and complete access for all castes to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest that began in 1924 (not 1925) in Travancore, focusing on the right of entry for lower-caste Hindus to certain public roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple (not the right to education). The year and the specific focus of the protest need correction.

Statement 2 is incorrect on multiple counts. While prominent figures supported the movement, Mahatma Gandhi's direct involvement was not as central as the statement suggests.  Further, the Satyagraha did not result in immediate and complete access to the temple.  The temple entry issue was resolved only gradually through subsequent legal and social changes, not directly as a result of the Satyagraha's immediate conclusion. The statement oversimplifies a complex historical process.

Therefore, only a modified version of statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies and oversimplifications within statement 2.


**4. With reference to the  Kakori Conspiracy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori Train Robbery, orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), took place in 1926 near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, aiming to secure funds for revolutionary activities.
2.  The key figures involved in the Kakori Conspiracy, including Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Roshan Singh, were all executed immediately after their trial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct except for the year. The Kakori Train Robbery occurred in 1925, not 1926.  The rest of the statement accurately describes the event's aim and location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Roshan Singh were indeed key figures and were sentenced to death,  the executions did not happen immediately after their trial. There was a period between the trial's conclusion and their executions. The statement misrepresents the timeline of events.


Therefore, only a corrected version of statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracies present in statement 2 regarding the immediate execution of the involved individuals.


**5. With reference to the Apartheid System in South Africa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Apartheid system, officially instituted in 1949, was a system of racial segregation and discrimination primarily targeting Black Africans, but not Coloureds or Indians.
2. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) was a solely South African-based movement that focused on internal resistance, without significant international support or sanctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Apartheid system, while primarily targeting Black Africans, also significantly impacted Coloureds and Indians through various discriminatory laws and practices. The statement inaccurately limits the system's impact.  The year is also slightly off; it was officially instituted in 1948.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) was a global movement with significant international support, leading to international sanctions against the South African regime. The statement misrepresents the movement's scope and impact.

Therefore, both statements contain significant inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements present misleading or incomplete information about the Apartheid system and the AAM.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating power within the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly extended Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I did consolidate power on the Coromandel Coast, his naval expeditions were far-reaching.  He decisively defeated the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, a significant naval victory that extended his influence. His conquests also included Sri Lanka (annexing its northern part) and a campaign against the Maldives.  His maritime dominance was crucial in establishing the Chola Empire's power and reach.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I, the successor of Rajaraja Chola I, significantly expanded the empire's maritime power. His conquest of the Sailendra Empire, which stretched across the Malay Peninsula and into Sumatra, is a testament to the Chola navy's strength and organizational capabilities. This expansion dramatically increased Chola influence in Southeast Asia, marking a high point in their maritime power projection. The conquest of the entire island of Sri Lanka further solidified their dominance in the Indian Ocean region.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, primarily focuses on preserving transhumance practices in the Himalayas.
2.  The UNESCO Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes documents related to transhumance practices in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative recognizes the importance of transhumance practices globally, its scope isn't limited to the Himalayas. The initiative aims to preserve and promote transhumance traditions worldwide, encompassing various regions and cultures where this practice is prevalent.  The inclusion of "Transhumance in 10 European States" and the "Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland" in the Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity list exemplifies this broader focus.

Statement 2 is correct.  The inclusion of manuscripts of Indian literary works like the *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* in the UNESCO Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register reflects the organization's recognition of the importance of preserving cultural heritage. While not directly related to the practice of transhumance itself, these texts may contain information or narratives that indirectly relate to or reflect the cultural significance of transhumance in India. The register's aim to preserve significant documentary heritage would encompass such cultural elements.


**3. With reference to India's Olympic participation and initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) programme targets elite athletes who have already demonstrated significant achievements at the national level.
2. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to athletes, with limited support for specialized training and equipment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) programme is specifically designed to identify and nurture young talent at the grassroots level. Its focus is on school children aged 9 to 18 years, aiming to provide a platform for the early identification and development of potential athletes before they reach the elite level.  The program aims to create a strong foundation for future athletic success.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) is a comprehensive program that goes beyond just financial assistance.  It provides athletes with a wide range of support, including specialized equipment, international exposure, top-tier coaching, and a monthly allowance.  The aim is to give India's top athletes the best possible resources and support to compete at the highest levels of international competition, maximizing their chances of achieving Olympic success.  Financial support is only one component of this multi-faceted scheme.


**4. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra and other Buddhist Mudras, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra, a symbol of fearlessness, is primarily associated with the Buddha's posture during his enlightenment under the Bodhi tree.
2.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra represents the Buddha's preaching of the Dharma.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Abhaya Mudra symbolizes fearlessness, it is not primarily linked to the Buddha's enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. That event is commonly associated with the Bhumisparsha Mudra (the earth-touching mudra). The Abhaya Mudra is shown in depictions of the Buddha in various contexts, often signifying reassurance and protection, but not specifically his enlightenment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra, or earth-touching mudra, symbolizes the Buddha's calling upon the earth to witness his overcoming of Mara's temptations during his meditation.  The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra (the turning of the wheel of dharma mudra) represents the preaching of the Dharma.  The two mudras have distinct meanings and symbolic representations within Buddhism.


**5. With reference to the illicit trafficking of antiquities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Culture Pathway, endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group, focuses on strengthening national laws to prevent the illegal export of antiquities within India.
2. The Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the USA primarily aims to facilitate the repatriation of Indian antiquities seized in third countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashi Culture Pathway, while promoting international cooperation against illicit trafficking, focuses on a broader approach than just strengthening domestic laws. It aims to build a global coalition to combat the problem, encompassing international collaboration, information sharing, and strengthening international legal frameworks. While domestic laws are important, the initiative's emphasis is on a coordinated global response.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the U.S. focuses on preventing the illicit import of Indian antiquities into the U.S. It aims to restrict the import of specific archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin, thereby reducing the flow of illegally trafficked objects into the U.S. market.  While repatriation is a desirable outcome, the CPA's primary goal is to prevent illegal imports rather than directly facilitating repatriation from third countries.  Repatriation often involves separate bilateral agreements or international cooperation beyond the scope of the CPA.


**6. With reference to the National Handloom Day and its significance, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Handloom Day is celebrated annually on August 7th to commemorate the contributions of Mahatma Gandhi to the revival of the Indian handloom industry.
2. The celebration aims to provide support and recognition to the handloom weavers and the handloom industry, promoting its growth and sustainability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi championed the cause of Khadi and village industries, including handlooms, the National Handloom Day is not directly linked to commemorating his specific contributions. The date of August 7th was chosen to mark a significant event related to the handloom industry's history, although the specific event is not always explicitly mentioned.  The day's focus is broader than just Gandhi's contributions.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary aim of National Handloom Day is to recognize the crucial role of handloom weavers and the importance of the handloom industry in India's cultural heritage and economy. The day's celebrations provide a platform to honor these artisans, support their livelihoods, and promote the growth and sustainability of the handloom sector.  The focus is on providing recognition, support, and creating awareness about the handloom industry's value.


**1. With reference to the Miyawaki method of afforestation, consider the following statements:**

1.  It involves planting a diverse range of native tree species in close proximity to accelerate growth and enhance biodiversity.
2.  The method was developed by a Japanese botanist and is known for its application in creating dense, self-sustaining forests in relatively short periods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Miyawaki method.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the core principle of planting diverse native species close together to mimic natural forest succession. This dense planting fosters competition, leading to faster growth and a more resilient, biodiverse ecosystem. Statement 2 correctly identifies the method's creator, Akira Miyawaki, a Japanese botanist, and its characteristic outcome: the rapid creation of mature-looking, self-sustaining forests.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially capture the essence of the Miyawaki method. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are factually accurate.  The Miyawaki method's success lies in its holistic approach, combining species diversity and dense planting to achieve rapid forest regeneration, making both statements integral to its understanding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed India's highest award in cinema, it's presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  Statement 2 is correct. The award was established in 1969 to mark Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary, and the recipient receives the described accolades. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Option (a) is incorrect because of the inaccuracy in statement 1 regarding the awarding body. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is not completely accurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is correct.  Understanding the precise awarding body is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award's administrative structure within the Indian film industry.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO’s Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only an International Register of documentary heritage.
2. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme, while having an International Register, also maintains regional and national registers for documentary heritage preservation.  Statement 2 is correct; the mentioned works are indeed included in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  Thus, only statement 2 is accurate. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.  The existence of regional and national registers within the MoW Programme reflects a geographically nuanced approach to preserving documentary heritage, highlighting the importance of regional context in the preservation efforts.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Bharat Ratna Award:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna award, established in 1954, is conferred posthumously only to Indian citizens for exceptional service in any field.
2.  Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President, a medallion, and a substantial monetary grant.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, the Bharat Ratna is not conferred *only* posthumously; while it was initially not given posthumously, that changed. Second, it is not limited to Indian citizens; several non-Indians have received the award. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While recipients receive a Sanad and a medallion, there is no monetary grant associated with the Bharat Ratna.  Therefore, both statements are inaccurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements are false.  The Bharat Ratna's eligibility criteria and lack of monetary reward are key aspects differentiating it from other prestigious awards.


**5. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "missing monuments" as those that have been lost or destroyed and are no longer traceable.
2. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist ancient monuments deemed no longer of national importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act does not officially define a category of "missing monuments."  The term emerged from CAG audit reports.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act does provide the Central Government with the power to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance, based on assessments of their historical significance and preservation needs. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.  The power of delisting under the AMASR Act highlights the dynamic nature of heritage preservation and the need for periodic reevaluation of the national importance of protected monuments.


**6. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, was primarily a Buddhist monastery with a focus on religious studies.
2.  The modern Nalanda University, established in 2010, is located near the ancient ruins and aims to be a centre of inter-civilisational dialogue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the ancient Nalanda University was a monastic university, it wasn't solely focused on religious studies; it encompassed a wide range of subjects, including medicine, astronomy, and fine arts. However, it had a strong Buddhist influence. Statement 2 is also correct. The modern Nalanda University's location and focus on inter-civilisational dialogue are accurate.  While statement 1 is not entirely precise, it captures the essence of the ancient Nalanda University. Therefore, both statements, despite minor inaccuracies, are essentially correct and convey the key features of both the ancient and modern institutions. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the two Nalanda Universities. The contrast between the ancient and modern institutions underscores the evolution of educational approaches and the enduring legacy of the original Nalanda.


**7. With reference to the Transhumance practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is the seasonal migration of pastoral communities and their livestock between high-altitude summer pastures and lower-altitude winter grazing grounds, primarily in the Himalayas.
2.  In India, this practice is confined to Himalayan regions, with nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas being the sole participants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines transhumance and its application in the Indian context, particularly in the Himalayas. Statement 2 is incorrect because, while the Himalayan regions are prominent locations for transhumance in India, the practice also exists in other parts of the country, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Option (b) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 1 is true. The geographical spread of transhumance in India underscores the adaptability of this traditional pastoral practice to varied ecological conditions.


**8. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya.
2.  The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observes IAD annually.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not his enlightenment.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture's collaboration with the IBC in observing IAD is accurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true. The precise event commemorated by IAD is a significant detail that distinguishes it from other Buddhist observances.


**9. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to emerging writers who demonstrate exceptional promise in their respective fields.
2. Ruskin Bond is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, considered the Akademi's highest honour for writers.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is not awarded annually to emerging writers; it's a lifetime achievement award conferred upon established writers of exceptional merit. Statement 2 is correct. Ruskin Bond's receipt of this prestigious fellowship is well-documented. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.  The distinction between the nature of the fellowship and its recipient highlights the criteria for this prestigious award in Indian literature.


**10. With reference to the 70th National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were established in 1954 and were initially known as the "State Awards," with awards given only in the feature film category.
2. The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the National Film Awards since their inception in 1954.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the National Film Awards were established in 1954 and initially called "State Awards," they included awards beyond just feature films. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Directorate of Film Festivals took over the administration of the awards in 1973, not from their inception. Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements are false.  The timeline of the National Film Awards and their administrative history are crucial details for understanding the evolution of the award system in the Indian film industry.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Ratan Tata's contributions to the Tata Group:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from approximately $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of India's largest employers.
2.  Tata Motors, under his leadership, received the PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for using completely plant-based materials in the interiors of its Avinya Concept car.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ratan Tata's tenure as chairman of the Tata Group witnessed a remarkable surge in the conglomerate's revenue, transforming it into a global giant and a significant employer within India. The growth spanned several decades and involved strategic acquisitions, expansions, and a focus on innovation across various sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Tata Motors did receive recognition for its commitment to sustainability and ethical sourcing, the award details are inaccurate. The Avinya Concept car incorporated vegan interiors, meaning it used materials that did not involve animal products, but the phrasing of "completely plant-based" is an oversimplification.  The award specifically recognized the move towards reducing animal product usage and not a complete shift to only plant-based materials.  The use of other synthetic or recycled materials is plausible.  The statement misrepresents the specifics of the award and the car's composition, rendering it incorrect.


**2. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in introducing Vedanta philosophy to the West and establishing him as a significant religious figure.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Swami Vivekananda's speech at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions was indeed a landmark event. His eloquent articulation of Vedanta philosophy captivated audiences and significantly increased Western awareness and interest in Indian spiritual thought.  His role as a key figure in disseminating Indian wisdom globally is well-established.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda championed scientific temperaments and met with Jamsetji Tata, inspiring his philanthropic endeavors, he did not directly oversee the establishment of the IISC.  The IISC's founding involved extensive planning, fundraising, and collaboration with various individuals and organizations over a considerable period.  Attributing direct oversight to Vivekananda is an overstatement of his involvement.


**3. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna award, India's highest civilian honor, is exclusively conferred upon Indian citizens for exceptional service in any field;  no non-Indians have ever received it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna has been awarded to non-Indian citizens on several occasions, recognizing their exceptional contributions to India or humanity.  This demonstrates the award's recognition of exceptional service regardless of nationality.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna does not include a monetary grant.  The award's prestige and significance lie in its symbolic value as the nation's highest civilian honor, representing recognition of extraordinary achievement, not monetary compensation.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the impact of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, built in memory of the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, features one of the world’s largest Miyawaki forests, illustrating a commitment to environmental restoration.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum incorporates a large Miyawaki forest as part of its design, showcasing a blend of memorialization and environmental initiatives.  This reflects a conscious effort to integrate ecological restoration into the memorial's purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The magnitude of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake is often cited inaccurately. While it was a significant and devastating earthquake, the magnitude was closer to 7.7, not 7.9, on the Richter scale. This seemingly small difference in magnitude can have significant implications in terms of the earthquake's energy release and effects.  The provided magnitude is a common but inaccurate figure.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Holkar Dynasty played a key role in the economic development of Maheswar, fostering its growth as a trading hub and particularly promoting the renowned Maheswari textile industry. The GI tag further recognizes the distinct identity and significance of this craft, establishing a direct link to the dynasty's patronage.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions to Mumbai's urban development are well-documented.  He played a crucial role in shaping the city's infrastructure and layout, leaving a lasting impact on its physical form.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Shankarseth was a significant patron of education and donated land for schools, he did not directly found Elphinstone College. The college's establishment involved a more complex process and a broader range of contributors.  Attributing its founding solely to Shankarseth is inaccurate.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Odisha Famine of 1866:**

1. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," occurred during the ninth regnal year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva and was exacerbated by the negligence of British administrators.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Odisha Famine of 1866 is indeed known by the alternative name "Na-Anka Famine" and occurred during Gajapati Divyasinghadeva's ninth regnal year.  The famine's severity was compounded by administrative failures and a lack of effective relief efforts by the British authorities.

Statement 2 is also accurate.  Following the famine, Thomas Edward Ravenshaw initiated educational reforms, establishing many vernacular schools, particularly emphasizing the Odia language. These initiatives aimed to address the social and educational needs of the affected population.


**8. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

2.  Malhar Rao II, ruler of the Holkar Dynasty during the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819), decisively defeated the British forces at the Battle of Mahidpur, securing a favourable treaty for the Holkars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, after her husband's and father-in-law's death, indeed established Maheshwar as the seat of the Holkar dynasty.  Her patronage significantly boosted the Maheswari weaving industry, leading to its present GI tag recognition for its distinctive sarees and fabrics. This demonstrates her economic acumen and contribution to local craftsmanship.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Malhar Rao II's reign did overlap with the Third Anglo-Maratha War, but he was decisively *defeated* at the Battle of Mahidpur. This defeat led to the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, which significantly curtailed Holkar power and established British dominance. The statement misrepresents the outcome of the battle and its consequences for the Holkar Dynasty.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Holkar Dynasty's involvement in the Anglo-Maratha wars and the accuracy of historical outcomes.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru did indeed receive the UNESCO Prix Versailles award in 2023. This award recognizes excellence in architectural design and its integration with the environment. The statement accurately reflects the nature of the award and the airport's recognition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum is notable for its Miyawaki forest and its memorial purpose, there's no mention of it receiving any UNESCO award in the provided text. The statement incorrectly attributes a UNESCO award to the museum based on its features. The question assesses understanding of specific UNESCO awards and their recipients, testing the ability to distinguish between factual information and potentially plausible but incorrect inferences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ahilyabai Holkar was a capable ruler, the provided text doesn't detail specific land reforms or their impact on agricultural productivity.  The statement presents a plausible but unsubstantiated claim about her economic policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Maheshwar and Indore becoming centers of trade and commerce under her rule, with a specific focus on promoting the Maheswari weaving industry. This accurately reflects a key aspect of her economic policies.  The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between generalized statements about economic policies and specific, verifiable details about Ahilyabai Holkar's reign.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure relied heavily on a centralized administrative system, with the Raya (king) directly controlling all aspects of governance and administration throughout the empire.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas, military commanders granted territories to govern, collected taxes, and retained a portion of the revenue for their personal use and the maintenance of their armies, temples, and irrigation works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure was not entirely centralized.  While the Raya held supreme authority, the text clearly mentions the significant role of Amara-Nayakas, who were granted considerable autonomy in their assigned territories. This indicates a decentralized element within the empire's governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the role of Amara-Nayakas, including their tax collection responsibilities and the use of a portion of the revenue for their personal needs and the upkeep of their armies, temples, and irrigation systems. This accurately depicts a key feature of the empire's administrative and political organization. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the decentralized nature of the Vijayanagara Empire's governance and the role of its regional administrators.

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization had a highly developed urban planning system, with cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa exhibiting sophisticated grid patterns, standardized brick sizes, and advanced sanitation systems.
2. The religious practices of the Indus Valley Civilization were primarily focused on the worship of a single, supreme deity, represented by the iconic "Pashupati" seal, indicating a highly unified and centralized religious structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indus Valley Civilization is renowned for its urban planning. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa demonstrate sophisticated city planning with grid layouts, standardized bricks, and advanced drainage systems. This highlights the civilization's engineering and organizational capabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the "Pashupati" seal is significant, it doesn't indicate a single, supreme deity as the sole focus of religious practices.  Evidence suggests a more diverse range of religious beliefs and practices, including the worship of Mother Goddess figurines and evidence of phallus worship. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of the Indus Valley Civilization's religious landscape. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the urban planning of the Indus Valley Civilization and the diversity of its religious practices, avoiding simplistic interpretations.


**6. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, instituted in 1969, is India's highest award in the field of cinema, presented annually to recognize outstanding contributions to the Indian film industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the namesake of the award, Dadasaheb Phalke, and his contribution of directing India's first feature film. It also accurately lists the components of the award: the Swarna Kamal, a shawl, and a cash prize (currently ₹10 lakhs).  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, its history, and the details associated with the award ceremony.


**7.  With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC at Lothal, Gujarat, is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways and will showcase India's rich maritime heritage from ancient times to the present, highlighting Lothal's significance as a prominent Indus Valley Civilization city.
2.  The NMHC will primarily focus on the reconstruction of Lothal's ancient port facilities and the creation of a museum dedicated solely to the archaeological artifacts unearthed at Lothal, neglecting other aspects of India's maritime history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the NMHC's development under the Sagarmala Programme, its aim to showcase India's maritime heritage, and its location at Lothal, emphasizing the historical significance of the site as a prominent Indus Valley Civilization city.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NMHC will certainly feature Lothal's archaeological significance, the text indicates a broader scope encompassing India's maritime heritage "from ancient times to the present."  The statement wrongly restricts the NMHC's focus, ignoring the project's broader aims. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the NMHC project, its location, purpose, and the scope of its historical coverage.


**8. With reference to the Kozhikode's recognition as a UNESCO City of Literature, consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode (Calicut), located on the Malabar Coast, is recognized by UNESCO as India's first City of Literature, primarily due to its rich literary traditions, historical significance as a center of learning, and its role in preserving ancient manuscripts.
2.  Kozhikode’s recognition as a UNESCO City of Literature is largely attributed to its long history of spice trade, its role as a major port city connecting India with global markets, and its influence on the development of international maritime trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kozhikode's UNESCO recognition as India's first City of Literature is directly linked to its rich literary traditions and historical role as a center of learning. Although it had a significant spice trade, the UNESCO recognition specifically focuses on its literary contributions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Kozhikode's history as a spice trading port is important, this is not the primary reason for its designation as a UNESCO City of Literature. The UNESCO recognition is specifically about literary contributions, not its role in the spice trade or maritime history.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the reasons behind Kozhikode's UNESCO recognition, emphasizing the specific criteria for the "City of Literature" designation.


**9. With reference to the Megalithic burial sites, consider the following statements:**

1. Megalithic burial sites, dating back to the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, are characterized by the use of large stones to construct burial structures and often contain grave goods, pottery, and other offerings, providing insights into the beliefs about death and the afterlife prevalent during that era.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description accurately reflects the characteristics of Megalithic burial sites, including their construction, the presence of grave goods, and their significance in understanding beliefs about death and the afterlife.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Hire Benkal site is mentioned as being under consideration for the UNESCO tentative list,  it has not yet been officially inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The statement incorrectly claims official inscription. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Megalithic burial sites, their characteristics, and the status of specific sites in relation to UNESCO recognition.



**10. With reference to the  classical languages declared by the Government of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Government of India's initiative to declare classical languages aims to preserve and promote the rich linguistic heritage of India, recognizing the unique cultural and historical significance of these languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The government's initiative to declare classical languages is aimed at the preservation and promotion of India's linguistic heritage.  This statement accurately reflects the rationale behind the designation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali were declared classical languages, the provided text doesn't state that this happened in 2024.  The statement incorrectly specifies the year of declaration.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the government's initiative to declare classical languages and the accuracy of details about the declaration of specific languages.


**1. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

2.  Swami Vivekananda's interactions with Jamsetji Tata significantly influenced Tata's decision to establish the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), showcasing Vivekananda's advocacy for a blend of spiritual and scientific progress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda did indeed present Advaita Vedanta at the Parliament of Religions, his address was broader than simply advocating for its superiority.  He presented Hinduism as a tolerant and inclusive religion, emphasizing its universal aspects and its capacity for synthesis with other belief systems.  His aim was to introduce Vedanta as a path to spiritual realization, not necessarily to promote it as superior to other philosophies. He focused on the common ground between different religions, seeking harmony and understanding rather than promoting hierarchical distinctions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Swami Vivekananda's meeting with Jamsetji Tata in 1893 is well-documented.  While the exact nature of their conversations remains a subject of interpretation, it's widely believed that Vivekananda's emphasis on the importance of scientific and technological advancement, combined with his spiritual ideals, significantly influenced Tata's vision for the IISc.  Vivekananda's emphasis on national self-reliance and the need for India to embrace modern science to progress resonated deeply with Tata's own aspirations for India's development.  This reflects a nuanced understanding of Vivekananda's influence, extending beyond purely spiritual matters.


**2. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty and Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic policies primarily focused on agricultural reform, introducing innovative farming techniques and land redistribution schemes to uplift the rural population.
2.  The Holkar Dynasty's participation in the Third Anglo-Maratha War resulted in significant territorial losses, ultimately leading to its subordination under the British East India Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw economic prosperity, her focus wasn't primarily on agricultural reform in the way described.  Her economic policies centered on promoting trade and commerce, making Maheshwar and Indore significant trading hubs. She patronized industries like the Maheswari weaving industry and fostered a conducive environment for economic growth. This involved infrastructure development and creating a stable political climate, but not necessarily direct interventions in agricultural practices.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Holkar Dynasty's involvement in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819) under Malhar Rao Holkar II ended disastrously at the Battle of Mahidpur. This defeat led to the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, which significantly reduced the Holkar's territory and placed them under the influence of the British East India Company, marking a crucial turning point in their political trajectory.  Their autonomy was curtailed, and they became a subsidiary state under British control.


**3. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recommendation for the Bharat Ratna is solely based on a formal nomination process, with a dedicated committee evaluating candidates based on pre-defined criteria of outstanding contribution.
2.  The Bharat Ratna award, initially not conferred posthumously, has been awarded to numerous non-Indians, reflecting India's recognition of exceptional contributions from across the globe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Prime Minister makes the recommendation to the President,  there isn't a strictly formal, pre-defined nomination process.  The selection process is less transparent and more discretionary, relying heavily on the Prime Minister's judgment and recommendations, rather than a rigid, publicly advertised application and evaluation procedure. This makes the process susceptible to political considerations and may not always reflect a purely meritocratic approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Bharat Ratna was initially not given posthumously, but this changed in 1966.  Significantly, the award has been bestowed upon several non-Indians, including Mother Teresa, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and Nelson Mandela, showcasing India's recognition of exceptional contributions from individuals outside its borders, demonstrating a global perspective.  This highlights the international reach and recognition of the award.


**4. With reference to the Arya Samaj, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy primarily focused on reinterpreting the Vedas through a literal interpretation, rejecting all forms of ritualistic worship and idolatry.
2.  The Arya Samaj, from its inception, was unified in its approach, with no significant internal divisions or ideological conflicts emerging throughout its history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj, advocated for a return to the Vedic principles, emphasizing a literal interpretation of the Vedas.  He vehemently opposed idolatry and ritualistic practices that he viewed as deviations from the original Vedic teachings. His emphasis on Vedic principles, rejection of idolatry, and promotion of a rational and monotheistic understanding of religion formed the core tenets of the Arya Samaj philosophy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Arya Samaj experienced a significant split in 1892, dividing into the Gurukul (conservative) and college (radical) factions. This division arose from disagreements over issues such as the language of instruction and dietary practices, highlighting the presence of internal ideological differences within the movement.  This demonstrates that the Arya Samaj was not monolithic and faced internal debates and divisions, contrary to the statement's claim of unity.


**5. With reference to  Ratan Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group experienced a significant expansion, with its revenue increasing by a factor of 20, establishing it as one of the largest conglomerates globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ratan Tata's tenure as chairman of the Tata Group witnessed an extraordinary period of growth and expansion.

2. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts have been included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, reflecting their significance in Indian literary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Port Blair's renaming to Sri Vijaya Puram does commemorate the islands' contributions to the Indian freedom struggle and highlights its historical and strategic significance. The renaming is also intended to move away from colonial legacy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts in the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register is indeed a testament to their significance in Indian literary heritage. Their inclusion highlights their enduring cultural importance and their contribution to the global literary landscape.  The MOW program aims to preserve and promote significant documentary heritage.


**13. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization's trade networks primarily focused on internal trade, with minimal evidence of external trade with Mesopotamia.
2.  Religious practices in the Indus Valley Civilization included the worship of a male deity (possibly proto-Shiva), a female deity (Mother Goddess), and evidence of phallus (Linga) worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indus Valley Civilization had extensive trade networks, with significant evidence of external trade, particularly with Mesopotamia.  Mesopotamian records mention the Indus region ("Meluha"), and archaeological findings support the existence of trade routes and exchange of goods.

Statement 2 is correct.  Religious practices in the Indus Valley Civilization included the worship of a male deity (possibly proto-Shiva), a female deity (Mother Goddess), and evidence suggests the prevalence of phallus (Linga) worship.  Archaeological findings, such as seals and figurines, provide insights into their religious beliefs and practices.  The nature of their religion remains a subject of ongoing research and interpretation.


**14. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD) and yoga's origins, consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2015, with India playing a key role in initiating the proposal.
2.  Systematic references to yoga are primarily found in Patanjali's Yogasutra (2nd century B.C.), with limited evidence of yoga practices in earlier periods like the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The UN did proclaim June 21st as IYD, but it was in 2014, not 2015.  India's significant role in proposing the resolution is accurate.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While some evidence suggests yoga practices existed earlier, systematic references are primarily found in Patanjali's Yogasutra from the 2nd century B.C.  The Indus Valley Civilization's potential connection to yoga is still debated, and the Yogasutra provides a more well-defined and structured understanding of yoga philosophy and practices.  The Yogasutra is considered a foundational text for the study of yoga.


**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on a report submitted by the Ministry of Culture, assessing the monument's national importance and traceability.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" and outlines a specific procedure for handling such cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's delisting of monuments is indeed based on assessments of national importance and traceability, conducted and reported by the Ministry of Culture.  This process is crucial for prioritizing the limited resources available for the conservation of historically and nationally significant sites.  The decision to delist reflects a pragmatic approach to managing a vast and diverse heritage portfolio.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* explicitly define "Missing Monuments." This term emerged from the usage by the CAG Audit team in their report.  The Act focuses on the declaration of monuments as ceasing to be of national importance, providing a legal framework for delisting but not specifically addressing "missing" monuments. The absence of a specific definition highlights the complex challenges involved in managing and preserving India’s extensive historical heritage.


**2. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University was established in the 5th century CE under the patronage of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya and continued as a prominent center of learning until the 15th century CE.
2.  The disciplines taught at ancient Nalanda University included only Buddhist philosophy and religious studies, reflecting its monastic origins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE, it was established under the patronage of Kumargupta I, not Chandragupta Maurya.  Furthermore, its existence ended in the 12th century CE with its destruction by Bakhtiyar Khalji, not the 15th century. The error in the statement highlights the importance of precise chronological accuracy in historical accounts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ancient Nalanda University offered a far broader curriculum than just Buddhist philosophy and religious studies.  It encompassed subjects like Vedas, Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and even war strategy.  The diverse range of subjects demonstrates the university's significance as a multidisciplinary center of learning, transcending purely religious confines.


**3. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Padma Awards were instituted in 1964 and are awarded annually on Independence Day to recognize exceptional and distinguished service in various fields.
2.  These awards are conferred posthumously in all deserving cases, regardless of the nature of the contribution or field of service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, not 1964, and are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day. While the statement correctly identifies the purpose of the awards—recognizing exceptional service—the factual inaccuracies concerning the year of inception and the day of announcement demonstrate the need for precision in recalling historical facts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Padma Awards are *not* normally conferred posthumously.  While the government *may* consider awarding posthumously in highly deserving cases, it's not a standard practice. The statement's assertion that posthumous awards are granted in all deserving cases is a significant misrepresentation of the established norms and procedures surrounding these prestigious awards.


**4. With reference to the Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court depicts her wearing western attire, symbolizing the continuity of legal traditions from colonial times.
2.  The blindfold on the Lady Justice statue has been removed in the new statue to represent the law's ability to see and understand societal complexities and differentiate between individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India depicts her in a saree, replacing the traditional Western attire. This change is a deliberate attempt to decolonize the imagery and align it with Indian cultural traditions. The statement's inaccuracy highlights the importance of paying close attention to details in assessing visual representations of cultural and historical significance.

Statement 2 is correct. The blindfold has been removed from the new statue, symbolizing that the law is not blind but rather sees and understands the complexities of society, applying principles of justice with awareness and discernment. The removal of the blindfold is a powerful symbolic gesture that reflects a shift in perspective on the role of justice in a diverse and evolving society.


**5. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The AMASR Act empowers only the state governments to declare ancient and historical monuments or archaeological sites and remains as being of national importance.
2. The National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established under the AMASR Act, 1958, to manage prohibited and regulated areas around centrally protected monuments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act empowers the *Central*, not state, government to declare monuments of national importance. This reflects the national significance attributed to these sites and the need for a unified national approach to their protection and preservation.  The statement's error underlines the importance of understanding the jurisdictional aspects of legislation related to cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, not the original 1958 Act. The NMA's creation signified a significant strengthening of the regulatory framework for the protection of monuments, reflecting an evolving understanding of the challenges involved in preserving India's vast cultural heritage.  The statement's error emphasizes the need to differentiate between the original Act and its subsequent amendments.


**6. With reference to the Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry in Mumbai is responsible for granting GI tags to products from various states across India.
2.  The GI tag system in India is primarily aimed at protecting the intellectual property rights associated with specific products from particular geographical regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geographical Indications Registry is located in Chennai, not Mumbai. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise factual recall in questions related to administrative bodies and their locations.  Such inaccuracies can easily lead to incorrect conclusions.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary aim of the GI tag system is indeed to protect the intellectual property rights associated with specific products originating from particular geographical regions. This protection safeguards the reputation and distinctiveness of products linked to their place of origin, benefiting producers and consumers alike.  The statement correctly identifies the core function of the GI tag system.


**7. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right to education for members of lower castes in the Travancore region.
2.  The Vaikom Satyagraha was led by Mahatma Gandhi and marked a significant turning point in the struggle for social justice in British India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily aimed at securing the right of entry for lower-caste people into the public roads leading to the Vaikom temple in Kerala, not the right to education. The focus on access to public spaces was a critical aspect of the struggle against social discrimination.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant movement for social justice, it was not directly led by Mahatma Gandhi.  Key leaders included T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan. The statement's error demonstrates the importance of correctly identifying the leadership of historical movements.  Attributing leadership to the wrong person significantly misrepresents the historical context.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Independence Day.
2.  The award comprises three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, and is generally not conferred posthumously, except in rare, highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954, they are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  The annual announcement on Republic Day is a significant aspect of the national celebration and highlights the achievements of the awardees.  The timing of the announcement is a key detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is correct. The Padma Awards are categorized into Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, recognizing exceptional and distinguished service across various fields.  The rule against posthumous awards, with exceptions for highly deserving individuals, is a crucial feature of the award's structure. This exception highlights the flexibility within the system to honor exceptional contributions even after the recipient's passing.  The fact that it is not a routine practice adds to the significance of the exceptions made.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the factual details surrounding the institution and conferring of Padma Awards, specifically regarding the date of announcement and the policy on posthumous conferrals.  Understanding the nuances of these details is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the Indian civilian award system.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
2.  The awards are based on write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal, aiming to improve governance through the sharing of their experiences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. While both entities deal with government employees, their specific mandates differ.  This subtle distinction highlights the importance of precise knowledge of government organizational structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The awards are indeed based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees/pensioners through write-ups on the Anubhav Portal.  The aim of fostering better governance and administrative reforms by leveraging the accumulated wisdom of retiring employees is a key objective of the award scheme. This demonstrates a proactive approach to utilizing institutional memory for improving public administration.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the misidentification of the awarding ministry.  The accurate identification of the awarding body underscores the importance of precise knowledge of the Indian governmental structure and its various departments.


**3. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Param Vir Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award.
2.  The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, not peacetime. This distinction is crucial in understanding the hierarchy of gallantry awards and the contexts in which they are bestowed.  Peacetime gallantry is recognized through different awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1952, not 1950. The wartime gallantry awards (Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950, while the Ashoka Chakra, initially having three classes, came later.  The precise dates of institution are important factual details for accurate knowledge of the awards system.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because both statements contain factual errors regarding the type of gallantry recognized by the Param Vir Chakra and the year of institution of the Ashoka Chakra.  A precise understanding of these details is necessary for a comprehensive grasp of India's gallantry awards system.


**4. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based on a report from the Ministry of Tourism.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, defines the term "Missing Monuments" to describe monuments that are untraceable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based on a report from the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Tourism.  This highlights the distinction between the roles of these two ministries in cultural preservation and tourism promotion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* define the term "Missing Monuments." This term was used by the CAG Audit team in their report, not the Act itself.  The absence of this term in the Act underscores the importance of differentiating between official legal terminology and informal usage.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect as both statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the source of the report informing the ASI's decision and the existence of the term "Missing Monuments" in the AMASR Act.  Understanding the precise legal framework and the involved ministries is crucial for accurate analysis.


**5. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University was founded by Chandragupta I in the 5th century CE.
2.  The new Nalanda University campus is a "Net Zero Green Campus".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I, not Chandragupta I, in the 5th century CE.  This highlights the importance of distinguishing between different historical figures and their contributions.  Confusing the two emperors would lead to a significant historical inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The new Nalanda University campus is indeed designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus," reflecting a commitment to environmental sustainability.  This signifies a modern approach to higher education, incorporating environmentally conscious practices.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the misidentification of the founder of the ancient Nalanda University.   The correct identification of the founder is a crucial element of historical accuracy.


**6. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda primarily preached Advaita Vedanta philosophy, excluding other schools of Vedanta.
2.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago established the Ramakrishna Mission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda's teachings heavily emphasized Advaita Vedanta, he also incorporated and acknowledged other schools of Vedanta thought, including Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita.  His holistic approach to Vedanta is a significant aspect of his philosophical contributions.  Restricting his philosophy to only Advaita is an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions was highly influential, the Ramakrishna Mission was established in 1897, *after* his address in 1893.  The temporal order of these two events is crucial to understanding the sequence of his contributions.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the breadth of Swami Vivekananda's philosophical approach and the timing of the establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission.  A nuanced understanding of his life and work is necessary for accurate assessment.


**7. With reference to Ratan Tata's accomplishments, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group experienced phenomenal growth, significantly increasing its revenue and solidifying its position as one of India's largest employers.  This demonstrates exceptional business acumen and leadership.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PETA India award was for the Tata Motors AVINYA Concept car, not the Indica.  This highlights the importance of precise details in assessing specific achievements.  The model of the car is a crucial detail that differentiates a correct answer from an incorrect one.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the misidentification of the Tata Motors car model that received the PETA award.  Accurate identification of the car model is important for precise assessment of the company's achievements.


**8. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the Prime Minister of India.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a monetary grant along with the award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna is granted by the President of India, not the Prime Minister.  Although the Prime Minister makes recommendations, the final authority for bestowing the award rests with the President.  This demonstrates the importance of understanding the constitutional distribution of powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna does *not* include any monetary grant.  It is purely an honorific award, recognizing exceptional contributions to the nation.  The absence of a monetary component is a key characteristic of the award.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect due to inaccuracies regarding the awarding authority and the inclusion of a monetary component. Understanding these details is crucial for a complete understanding of India's highest civilian award.


**9. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Film Awards were indeed established in 1954 and were initially known as "State Awards."  This historical detail is significant in understanding the evolution of the awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Film Awards are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Central Board of Film Certification.  These two bodies have distinct roles in the Indian film industry; the former awards films, while the latter certifies them for public exhibition.  The distinction between these two organizations is vital.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the misidentification of the body administering the National Film Awards.  Knowing the correct administering body is crucial for understanding the award's structure and process.


**10. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initiative places *special emphasis* on training women and youth, not primarily men. This focus on women and youth is a crucial aspect of the initiative's social impact.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative aims to improve the tourist experience by connecting visitors with local people who act as ambassadors and storytellers for their destinations.  This approach emphasizes community engagement and authentic cultural experiences.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because of the misrepresentation of the initiative's target demographic for training.  Understanding the focus on women and youth is crucial to accurately assessing the initiative's goals.

2. The blindfold symbolizes the impartiality of justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the figure of Lady Justice has ancient roots, the addition of the blindfold is traced to the Renaissance period, not ancient Greek mythology. The evolution of the iconography of Lady Justice is a complex subject requiring detailed knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct.  The blindfold on Lady Justice is a widely understood symbol representing impartiality in judgment, signifying that justice should be blind to factors such as social status, wealth, or personal biases.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccurate origin of the blindfold in the depiction of Lady Justice.  Knowing the correct historical context is essential for a complete understanding of the symbolism.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Independence Day.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954, they are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  The annual announcement on Republic Day is a significant aspect of the Indian governmental calendar, highlighting the importance given to these civilian awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  There are only three categories of Padma Awards: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.  There is no "Padma Ratna" category. The distinct levels of these awards reflect the varying degrees of exceptional and distinguished service recognized by the government.  Understanding the specific criteria for each category is crucial for comprehending the nuances of this prestigious honour.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Department's role in recognizing and utilizing the experience of retiring employees highlights the government's focus on leveraging institutional memory. The Anubhav Portal serves as a platform for these retiring employees to share their experiences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The primary aim of the Anubhav Awards is to foster good governance and administrative reforms based on the experience shared by retiring central government employees/pensioners.  The focus is on improving future administrative practices, not specifically on innovation or technological advancements, though these may be incidentally included in the shared experiences.


**3. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Param Vir Chakra is the highest gallantry award for wartime bravery, it is not exclusively awarded posthumously.  It can be awarded to living recipients as well, recognizing their exceptional acts of courage during wartime.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra were not all instituted in 1952.  The wartime awards (Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950.  The Ashoka Chakra (in its various classes) was instituted in 1952, but Kirti Chakra and Shaurya Chakra came later with a renaming in 1967. The different timelines for the institution of these awards reflect the evolution of the recognition system for gallantry.


**4. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has delisted 24 centrally protected monuments deemed to be "untraceable" and lacking national importance.
2.  The delisting process is governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, which allows the Central Government to declare that a monument has ceased to be of national importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASI intends to delist 18, not 24, centrally protected monuments. While the monuments were deemed "untraceable" and lacking national importance, the precise number to be delisted is 18.  The discrepancy highlights the complexities of managing and maintaining a vast national heritage.

Statement 2 is correct.  Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for the delisting of monuments. This section empowers the Central Government to make such a declaration based on assessments of national importance.  Understanding the legal basis of the delisting process is vital for analyzing the implications of such actions.


**5. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution, which is a Directive Principle of State Policy, mandates the protection of monuments and places of national importance.
2. The AMASR Act, 1958, establishes the National Monuments Authority (NMA) as the primary body responsible for the management and preservation of centrally protected monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and objects of national importance. This constitutional provision underscores the significance of preserving India's cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for the protection of monuments, the National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established later by the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, not by the original 1958 Act.  The establishment of the NMA reflects a later effort to streamline the management and preservation of nationally important monuments.


**6. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is located near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Bodh Gaya, Bihar.
2. The establishment of Nalanda University was primarily driven by a decision made during the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the new Nalanda University campus is indeed near the ancient Nalanda ruins, it is located in Rajgir, Bihar, not Bodh Gaya. The location near the ancient site underscores the continuity of learning and the historical significance of the institution.

Statement 2 is correct. The decision to establish Nalanda University was indeed made during the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines in 2007. This decision reflects a broader regional effort to promote cultural exchange and educational collaboration.


**7. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded to a maximum of five individuals annually, irrespective of their field of achievement.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna are prohibited from using the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name, but they may mention their award in their official biographies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While there have been instances where more than three Bharat Ratna awards were given in a year (such as four in 1999 and five in 2024),  the general rule is that a maximum of three awards can be given each year.  The exceptions highlight the exceptional circumstances in which the government may choose to deviate from the usual practice.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits the use of the "Bharat Ratna" title as a prefix or suffix, but recipients are permitted to mention the award in their official biographies or other documentation. This reflects a balance between recognizing the award's prestige and upholding constitutional principles regarding titles.



**8. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were instituted in 1954 and initially referred to as the "State Awards."
2.  The awards are presented in only two categories: Feature Films and Non-Feature Films.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Film Awards were indeed established in 1954 and initially called "State Awards." The evolution of the name reflects the growing national importance of the awards.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The National Film Awards are presented in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema. The three categories reflect the diverse aspects of filmmaking recognized by the awards.


**9. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in Gujarat was awarded the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in 2023.
2.  The award is categorized into 24 world titles, including airports, campuses, passenger stations, sports facilities, and museums.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was shortlisted for the award, but it did not win the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in 2023.  The shortlisting itself is a significant recognition of the museum's architectural merit.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prix Versailles Award is indeed categorized into 24 world titles, encompassing a wide range of architectural projects. The multiple categories reflect the diverse applications of architectural design.


**10. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented biennially, recognizing lifetime achievement in Indian cinema.
2. The award includes a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ₹20 lakhs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented annually, not biennially. The annual presentation underscores the consistent recognition of lifetime achievement in Indian cinema.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the award does include a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion and a shawl, the cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs. The details of the award reflect the value placed on recognizing contributions to Indian cinema.


**11. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right to education for the lower castes in Travancore.
2. K. Kelappan, also known as the "Kerala Gandhi," played a significant role in leading the Vaikom Satyagraha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on securing temple entry rights for the lower castes, not the right to education.  The focus on temple entry reflects the broader struggle against caste discrimination.

Statement 2 is correct. K. Kelappan, known as the "Kerala Gandhi," was indeed a prominent leader of the Vaikom Satyagraha.  His participation highlights the movement's wider significance within the Indian independence struggle.


**12. With reference to the new flag, insignia, and Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court depicts her wearing a saree instead of Western attire, holding the Indian Constitution instead of a sword, and with her eyes open instead of blindfolded.
2.  The new Supreme Court flag features the Ashok Chakra at the top, the iconic Supreme Court building in the centre, and the Book of Constitution at the bottom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The new Lady Justice statue indeed reflects a decolonization effort by depicting her in Indian attire (a saree), holding the Indian Constitution (symbolizing the rule of law rooted in the Constitution), and with her eyes open (symbolizing vigilance and awareness in dispensing justice).

Statement 2 is also correct. The new Supreme Court flag incorporates these elements: Ashok Chakra representing the nation, the Supreme Court building representing the institution, and the Book of Constitution representing the foundational legal document.  The design reflects the court's role within the Indian nation.


**13. With reference to the FIDE (World Chess Federation), consider the following statements:**

1. FIDE was founded in 1924 in London, United Kingdom, under the motto “Gens una Sumus.”
2.  FIDE currently has its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the motto "Gens una Sumus" is accurate, FIDE was founded in Paris, France, not London, United Kingdom.  The location of its founding reflects the early international nature of the organization.

Statement 2 is correct. FIDE's headquarters are currently located in Lausanne, Switzerland.  The location of the headquarters reflects the organization's continued international reach and governance.


**14. With reference to the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup was won by India for the third time, defeating Australia in the final held in Australia.
2.  The T20 World Cup is organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, UAE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India won the 2024 T20 World Cup for the second time, not the third.  The opponent in the final was South Africa, not Australia, and the final was held in the USA and West Indies, not Australia.  The factual inaccuracies highlight the importance of verifying sporting results.

Statement 2 is correct. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, is indeed the organizing body for the T20 World Cup.  The ICC's role in governing and organizing international cricket is crucial to understanding the global nature of the sport.


**15. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1. Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has been renamed as Sri Vijaya Puram to commemorate the victory of the Indian freedom movement and the strategic importance of the islands during the Chola Empire.
2.  The renaming also marks a departure from the colonial legacy and underscores the islands' role as a naval base for the British East India Company.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram is intended to commemorate the Indian freedom movement and highlight the historical significance of the islands, particularly their role as a naval base for the Chola Empire.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the renaming does mark a departure from the colonial legacy, it primarily emphasizes the Chola Empire's role, not the British East India Company's. The emphasis on the Chola Empire highlights a pre-colonial aspect of the islands' history.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but not the entire island of Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola did defeat the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and annex a portion of northern Sri Lanka, the statement incorrectly attributes a Pandya navy defeat to him.  The primary naval rivals of the Cholas were the Cheras and later the Pandyas,  but the specific battle mentioned was against the Chera, not the Pandya, navy.  The annexation of northern Sri Lanka is accurate.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded Chola naval power, leading to conquests in the Sailendra Empire, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The statement's inaccuracy lies in its assertion that Rajendra Chola I did *not* conquer the entire island of Sri Lanka. While Rajaraja Chola had already annexed the northern part, Rajendra I's campaigns further solidified Chola control over the entire island, making it a Chola province.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan, focuses solely on European transhumance traditions.
2. In India, transhumance is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region by nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis, with minimal presence in the plains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative did recognize European transhumance traditions (as mentioned in the text),  it's explicitly stated to be a *global* initiative, not limited to Europe. The statement misrepresents the scope of the initiative by implying an exclusive focus on Europe.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text clearly mentions that transhumance practices exist in the Himalayan regions *and* in the plains of states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement wrongly minimizes the prevalence of transhumance in the Indian plains.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts signifies India's sole representation in the 10th MOWCAP meeting held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
2. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only an International Register, excluding regional and national registers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the three Indian literary works were included *along with 17 other works from the region*. This demonstrates that India was not the sole representative at the meeting. The statement misrepresents the number of participating countries and works.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that the MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. The statement incorrectly limits the registers to only the International Register, omitting the crucial regional and national components.


**4. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization's trade network included Meluha (the Indus region itself), Dilmun (modern-day Iran), and Makan (the Makran coast).
2.  The Harappan script, while pictographic and written in a boustrophedon style, has been successfully deciphered, revealing details about their religious beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Mesopotamian records do refer to the Indus region as Meluha, and Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) are accurately identified as intermediate trading stations. The statement presents the key trade connections accurately.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the Harappan script is pictographic and uses the boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right writing), it remains undeciphered.  The statement falsely claims that the script has been deciphered and provides insights into religious beliefs. This is a significant misconception about the current state of Harappan studies.


**5. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMHC, developed under the Sagarmala Programme, showcases India's maritime heritage solely focusing on the post-independence era.
2. Lothal's historical significance rests primarily on its location near the Gulf of Khambat and its status as a major port city of the Gupta Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The aim of the NMHC is explicitly stated to showcase India's rich maritime heritage from *ancient times to the present*. The statement falsely limits the scope to only the post-independence period.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Lothal is correctly identified as being near the Gulf of Khambat, but it is a prominent city of the *Indus Valley Civilization*, not the Gupta Empire. The statement incorrectly attributes Lothal to a later period in Indian history.  Its dry dock is also a key feature.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's zenith was reached under the Saluva Dynasty, known for its extensive territorial gains and stable political structure.
2. The Amara-Nayakas system involved military commanders who were granted territories to rule, collecting taxes and retaining a portion of the revenue for personal use and maintaining temples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that the Vijayanagara Empire reached its zenith under the *Tuluva Dynasty*, not the Saluva Dynasty. The Saluva dynasty was a transitional phase after the decline of the Sangama Dynasty. The statement incorrectly assigns the empire's peak to the wrong dynasty.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Amara-Nayaka system accurately reflects their role as military commanders granted territories, their tax collection responsibilities, and their use of revenue for personal needs and the upkeep of temples and infrastructure.


**7. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra and other Buddhist Mudras, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, symbolizing fearlessness, is exclusively associated with the first Dhyani Buddha, Vairocana.
2. The Bhumisparsha Mudra represents the Buddha's preaching of the Dhamma (Buddhist teachings).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra does symbolize fearlessness, it is associated with the *fifth* Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not Vairocana, the first Dhyani Buddha.  The statement incorrectly links the mudra to the wrong Buddha.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra symbolizes the Buddha's calling upon the earth to witness his enlightenment, not the preaching of the Dhamma.  The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra is the one associated with preaching the Dhamma.  The statement confuses the meanings of two different mudras.


**8. With reference to the efforts to prevent the illicit trafficking of cultural property, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) primarily aims to facilitate the quick seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities from countries other than the USA.
2.  The Kashi Culture Pathway, endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group, focuses solely on domestic measures within India to combat the illicit trafficking of antiquities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPA does aim to facilitate the repatriation of Indian antiquities, its scope is specifically limited to the *USA*.  The statement incorrectly expands its reach to other countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kashi Culture Pathway is explicitly mentioned as endorsing a *global* coalition to combat illicit trafficking.  The statement incorrectly restricts its focus to only domestic measures within India.  The initiative aims for international cooperation.


**1. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Saluva dynasty ruled the empire during its zenith, significantly expanding its territorial control.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the annexation of the Raichur doab and military victories against Orissa and Bijapur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Tuluva dynasty, not the Saluva dynasty, is credited with the Vijayanagara Empire reaching its zenith.  The Saluva dynasty's rule followed the decline of the Sangama dynasty and served as a transitional period before the rise of the more powerful Tuluvas.  While the Saluvas did contribute to the empire's stability, they did not preside over its greatest expansion or power.

Statement 2 is correct. Krishnadevaraya's reign (1509-1529) was a period of significant military success and territorial expansion for the Vijayanagara Empire.  His conquests included the strategically important Raichur doab, located between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers. He also successfully subdued the rulers of Orissa and inflicted major defeats on the Sultan of Bijapur, solidifying Vijayanagara's dominance in the region.  This demonstrates his military prowess and impactful leadership during a high point of the empire's power.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly impacting the Sailendra Empire.
2.  Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Indian subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajendra Chola I (reigned c. 1014-1044 CE) launched ambitious naval expeditions that extended far beyond the Indian subcontinent. His conquests reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly impacting the Sailendra Empire, a powerful maritime power of Southeast Asia. This expansion showcases the Chola's formidable naval capabilities and their reach into the wider Indian Ocean world.  These expeditions significantly expanded Chola influence and trade networks in the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I (reigned c. 985-1014 CE) did achieve considerable naval success, his conquests were not limited to the Coromandel Coast. His naval forces successfully challenged and defeated the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and also significantly expanded Chola power by annexing the northern part of Sri Lanka and conquering the Maldives. This demonstrates that his naval ambitions and achievements extended beyond solely consolidating coastal control.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas, a 16th-century epic poem in Awadhi, and the Panchatantra, an ancient collection of fables, were included in the register in 2023.
2. The MoW program, launched in 1992, maintains only an International Register, focusing solely on globally significant documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas, authored by Goswami Tulsidas in the 16th century, and the Panchatantra, an ancient Sanskrit collection of fables, are among the Indian literary works included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  Their inclusion highlights their cultural significance and the importance of preserving these works for future generations.  The inclusion reflects the ongoing efforts to safeguard and promote important elements of India's literary heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNESCO Memory of the World (MoW) program, established in 1992, maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National.  This tiered approach allows for the recognition and preservation of documentary heritage at various levels, from globally significant works to those of national or regional importance. The program aims for broader inclusion and preservation of diverse documentary heritages worldwide.


**4. With reference to the Abhidhamma Day, consider the following statements:**

1.  The International Abhidhamma Day commemorates the descent of Buddha from the Trayastrimsa heaven to Sankassa in Uttar Pradesh, marked by the Asokan Elephant Pillar.
2. The event coincides with the end of the three-month rainy season retreat (Vassa) for Buddhist monks and the Pavarana ceremony.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. International Abhidhamma Day commemorates the day when the Buddha descended from the Trayastrimsa heaven (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh.  This significant event is marked by the presence of an Asokan Elephant Pillar at the site, further underscoring its historical and religious importance. The event is significant for Buddhists globally.

Statement 2 is also correct. The descent of the Buddha from the heavens is associated with the end of the three-month rainy season retreat (Vassa), a period of seclusion and intensive study for Buddhist monks. The Pavarana ceremony, which marks the conclusion of Vassa, is also held at this time, signifying the importance of this period in the Buddhist calendar.  The timing of the event links it to important aspects of Buddhist monastic practice.


**5. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The civilization used dried bricks for construction, similar to contemporary Egypt, and lacked an advanced drainage system.
2.  The civilization's agricultural practices included the cultivation of cotton, making it the earliest known producer of this crop.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indus Valley Civilization is renowned for its advanced urban planning and sophisticated infrastructure, including a remarkable underground drainage system that connected houses to street drains. This contrasts sharply with the statement's assertion of a lack of advanced drainage. While both civilizations used bricks, the Indus Valley Civilization utilized burnt bricks joined with gypsum mortar, a more advanced technique than the dried bricks used in contemporary Egypt.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indus Valley Civilization is credited with being the earliest known producer of cotton.  Archaeological evidence supports the cultivation and use of cotton in their textiles and other crafts.  This signifies their advanced agricultural knowledge and their contribution to the history of textile production.  The Greeks later referred to Indian cotton as "Sindon," further highlighting its importance in ancient trade.


**6. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Upper Paleolithic period paintings primarily feature naturalistic depictions of animals, with limited human representation.
2. Mesolithic period paintings showcase a shift towards more stylized human figures engaged in hunting and communal activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Upper Paleolithic period paintings do include animal representations (bison, elephants, tigers etc.), they also feature stick-like human figures, indicating that human representation was present, albeit in a more rudimentary style compared to later periods.  The statement oversimplifies the nature of the artistic representations.

Statement 2 is correct. Mesolithic period rock paintings are characterized by a greater emphasis on human figures, depicting hunting scenes, community dances, and other social interactions. While animals are still depicted, the human element becomes more prominent and often portrayed in a more stylized manner than the naturalistic representations found in earlier periods.  This reflects a potential shift in artistic focus and societal organization.


**7. With reference to Srikakulam's history and cultural sites, consider the following statements:**

1. Srikakulam, formerly known as Chicacole, was a significant center of Buddhism, with sites like Salihundam playing a crucial role in the spread of the religion to Southeast Asia.
2. The region was solely under the rule of the Kalinga dynasty before being incorporated into the Vijayanagara Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Srikakulam (formerly Chicacole), located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, has a rich history associated with Buddhism.  Sites like Salihundam are considered significant centers of Buddhist activity, and there's evidence suggesting a role in the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra and other parts of Southeast Asia.  This highlights the region's historical importance in the spread of religious and cultural influences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Srikakulam was indeed part of the Kalinga dynasty, its history is far more complex than that. After the Kalinga dynasty, the region came under the control of various other kingdoms and empires, including the Gajapati Kingdom, Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi, Kakatiya dynasty and the Vijayanagara Empire.  The statement's assertion that it was *solely* under Kalinga rule is an oversimplification of a more nuanced historical sequence.


**8. With reference to Charaideo Moidams, consider the following statements:**

1. Charaideo Moidams, located in the foothills of the Patkai range in Assam, are royal necropolises of the Koch dynasty.
2.  The Moidams are recognized for their unique architectural features, including the use of banyan trees and the creation of water bodies near the burial sites.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Charaideo Moidams are the royal necropolises of the Tai-Ahom dynasty, not the Koch dynasty.  The Ahom dynasty ruled Assam for a considerable period, and their burial practices and the construction of Moidams are a significant aspect of their cultural heritage. The statement confuses two distinct dynasties.

Statement 2 is correct. The Moidams are known for their unique architectural features.  Banyan trees and other specific trees were planted near the burial mounds, and water bodies were also created as part of the complex.  These features reflect the Ahom's beliefs and practices related to death and the afterlife, showcasing a distinctive cultural landscape.  The careful integration of natural elements into the design highlights their reverence for nature.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwara Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  It's located at the confluence of the Krishna river and the Bhavanasi river, along with five other tributaries.  The statement incorrectly identifies the presiding deity and one of the rivers.

Statement 2 is correct.  There are several temples dedicated to Sangameshwara (Lord Shiva) across India.  This includes temples in Telangana and Karnataka. Notably, one of the Sangameshwara temples in Karnataka is located within the Pattadakal group of monuments, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The existence of multiple temples with the same name highlights its regional and religious significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kamakhya Temple's original structure was destroyed, and the temple that stands today was reconstructed in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty, not the Pala dynasty.  The statement incorrectly identifies both the century and the dynasty responsible for its current structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ambubachi Mela is an important annual festival celebrated at the Kamakhya Temple in Assam.  This festival is unique in its commemoration of the annual menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, highlighting the temple's distinct Tantric traditions. The festival's significance lies in its connection to the temple's unique religious practices and its attraction of numerous devotees.


**1. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district (Andhra Pradesh) is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is situated at the confluence of five rivers.
2.  The Chalukya dynasty constructed the Sangameswar temple in Nandyal, which annually submerges in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  While it is located at the confluence of rivers, the number is not five but six: Krishna, Bhavansi, Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi and Malapaharini. The question deliberately misrepresents the deity and the number of rivers to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the Sangameswar temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, submerges annually in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam and that it was built by the Chalukya dynasty. This is a precise detail requiring factual recall.


**2. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kamakhya Temple, located on the Nilachal hills in Assam, was originally constructed in the 12th century by the Pala dynasty.
2. The Ambubachi Mela festival commemorates the annual appearance of Goddess Kamakhya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The original Kamakhya temple was destroyed by Kala Pahar and was reconstructed in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty, not the Pala dynasty in the 12th century. The question attempts to mislead by substituting a related but incorrect dynasty.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions that the Ambubachi Mela at the Kamakhya temple commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya. This is a direct factual recall point.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding prehistoric rock paintings in India:**

1. The Upper Paleolithic period rock paintings in India primarily depict human figures engaged in hunting and community dances.
2.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic period paintings in India are characterized by vibrant colours such as green and dark red, and feature naturalistic depictions of animals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Upper Paleolithic period paintings in India feature linear representations of animals (bison, elephants, tigers), and stick-like human figures;  hunting and community dances are characteristic of the Mesolithic period.  The question conflates the characteristics of different periods.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic period paintings in India predominantly use white and red colours (from haematite and limestone), not the vibrant green and dark red of the earlier periods. Furthermore, while animals are depicted, the description of them as "naturalistic" is more applicable to the Mesolithic period; Neolithic-Chalcolithic animal depictions are described as "youthful and majestic". The question reverses the colour palette and artistic style.


**4. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tuluva dynasty oversaw the empire's decline and eventual collapse.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab and military victories against Orissa and the Bijapur Sultanate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Tuluva dynasty, in fact, presided over the empire's zenith, not its decline. The Aravidu dynasty is associated with the period of internal conflicts and external pressures leading to the empire's fall. The question reverses the chronological association of the dynasty with the empire's trajectory.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly details Krishnadevaraya's military successes and territorial expansion during his reign, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab and victories over Orissa and the Bijapur Sultanate. This is a direct factual recall question.


**5. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus script is a fully deciphered pictographic script written in a boustrophedon style.
2.  Evidence suggests extensive trade with Mesopotamia, exporting items such as grain, jewelry, and pottery, and importing copper and precious stones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indus script is pictographic and was written in a boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), it remains undeciphered. The question presents an incorrect assertion about the decipherment status of the script.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly indicates the existence of both internal and external trade in the Indus Valley Civilization, specifying the export of grain, jewelry, and pottery, and the import of copper and precious stones.  The reference to Meluha in Mesopotamian records further supports this.  This is a direct factual recall question.


**6. With reference to the Chola Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended to Sri Lanka and the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
2. The Chola navy decisively defeated the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai, establishing Chola dominance over the southern Indian coast.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly describes Rajendra I's extensive naval conquests, including those in Sri Lanka and the Sailendra Empire, leading to the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This is a direct factual recall question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions Rajaraja I's destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, not Rajendra I's defeat of the Pandya navy.  The question incorrectly attributes the naval victory to the wrong Chola ruler and the wrong opponent.


**7. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Culture in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode.
2. Lothal's historical significance includes its location near the Gulf of Khambat and the discovery of the oldest known man-made dry dock, dating back to 2400 BC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NMHC at Lothal is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme and in a PPP mode, it is being developed by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, not the Ministry of Culture. The question substitutes the incorrect ministry to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Lothal's location and the significance of the discovery of the ancient dry dock, dating back to 2400 BC. This is a direct factual recall question.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative:**

1. The initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses on preserving traditional agricultural practices involving seasonal livestock movement.
2.  In 2023, transhumance traditions in India, specifically those of the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas in the Himalayas, were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, its leadership by ICOMOS, support from Azerbaijan, and its focus on preserving the traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement, often involving human migration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Indian transhumance practices are mentioned,  the text states that *European* transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023, not those specific to India. The question incorrectly attributes the UNESCO recognition to Indian traditions.


**9. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, included manuscripts of the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
2. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage and enhance public awareness about documentary heritages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar did add Indian works to the register, it included manuscripts of the *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, not the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Gita. The question substitutes the incorrect literary works to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the MoW Programme's objectives, its launch date (1992), and its goal of preserving documentary heritage and raising public awareness. This is a direct factual recall question.


**10. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ruskin Bond received the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, but his primary literary contributions are in English, not Hindi. The question incorrectly specifies the language of his literary work.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly describes the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship as the highest honour bestowed by the Akademi and its reservation for writers of exceptional merit. This is a direct factual recall question.


**1. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton from India with 100% traceability and certification, utilizing blockchain technology for ensuring transparency in its supply chain.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the sole implementing agency responsible for the branding, traceability, and certification of Kasturi Cotton Bharat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is indeed a premium quality Indian cotton with a strong emphasis on traceability and certification, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency throughout its supply chain, from farm to final product. This enhances consumer trust and allows for better monitoring of sustainability practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL plays a significant role in the implementation of Kasturi Cotton Bharat, it's not the *sole* implementing agency. The initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, various trade bodies, and industry stakeholders.  This collaborative approach is crucial for ensuring the success of the program by bringing together diverse expertise and resources.  TEXPROCIL's role is primarily focused on promotion and export, not exclusive implementation.


**2. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a Ministry of Culture initiative aimed at promoting art in public spaces across India, transforming urban landscapes into accessible art galleries through commissioned artwork.
2. The implementation of Project PARI's first intervention in Delhi involved over 150 visual artists creating solely paintings and murals, excluding other art forms like sculptures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, is designed to democratize art by bringing it into public spaces.  It aims to transform urban environments into accessible art galleries, enhancing public engagement with various art forms. The initiative's goal is to make art more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Project PARI's first intervention in Delhi did indeed involve over 150 artists, the statement incorrectly limits the art forms to just paintings and murals. The project encompasses a much broader range of artistic mediums, including sculptures and various traditional Indian art forms like Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, Bani Thani painting, and Alpana art.  The diversity of art forms reflects India's rich cultural heritage.


**3. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Tourism launched the "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative across 100 tourist destinations in India to promote responsible tourism.
2.  The initiative primarily focuses on training local women as guides and hosts to enhance the tourism experience while empowering local communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The number of tourist destinations covered by the "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative is 50, not 100, as stated.  While the program aims for national reach, its initial rollout targeted a specific number of key tourist destinations.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The initiative's core objective is to promote responsible tourism by engaging and empowering local communities.  A key component involves training local women as guides and hosts, creating employment opportunities and improving the quality of the tourist experience through authentic local insights.  While other aspects of responsible tourism are undoubtedly involved, the focus on women's empowerment is a central feature.


**4. With reference to the Kashi Culture Pathway and the fight against illicit trafficking of antiquities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Culture Pathway initiative is directly involved in the global coalition to combat illicit trafficking of antiquities, as endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group.
2.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is responsible for the coordination and recovery of antiquities traced within India, based on provisions within Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kashi Culture Pathway is a significant cultural initiative, it's not directly involved in the global coalition against illicit trafficking of antiquities endorsed by the G20. The pathway focuses on cultural preservation and tourism within a specific region.  The fight against illicit trafficking requires a broader, international collaboration.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, indeed prevents the export of antiquities from India.  Furthermore, the ASI plays a crucial role in coordinating and recovering any antiquities that are traced within the country. This highlights the government's commitment to protecting its cultural heritage.


**5. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD) and its significance, consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD to commemorate the anniversary of a significant historical event related to yoga's origins in India.
2. Yoga's emergence as a key instrument of India's soft power is primarily due to its association with ancient spiritual practices and philosophical traditions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN proclaimed June 21st (Summer Solstice) as IYD in 2014 to raise global awareness about the numerous benefits of yoga.  The date is chosen for its astronomical significance (Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere) and not to commemorate a specific historical event related to yoga's origins.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While yoga's historical and spiritual roots are undoubtedly part of its appeal, its emergence as a key element of India's soft power is a multifaceted phenomenon.  It's the combination of its health benefits, its adaptability to diverse cultures, and its promotion as a holistic approach to well-being that has contributed significantly to its global popularity and role in cultural diplomacy.


**6. With reference to the  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972 and its implementation, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 4 of the Act empowers the State Governments to declare monuments of national importance.
2. The National Monuments Authority (NMA), established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, manages prohibited and regulated areas around centrally protected monuments to ensure their preservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Section 4 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, empowers the *Central*, not State, Government to declare monuments of national importance.  This reflects the national significance of these sites and the need for uniform standards in their protection.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Monuments Authority (NMA), established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, indeed plays a crucial role in managing prohibited and regulated areas around centrally protected monuments. This is critical for preventing encroachment and damage to these historically and culturally significant sites. The NMA's role is vital for ensuring the long-term preservation of India's heritage.


**7. With reference to the ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, primarily focused on Vedic studies and excluded Buddhist philosophical traditions from its curriculum.
2. The library at Nalanda, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," housed over nine million books across nine floors, showcasing the university's vast collection of knowledge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nalanda University did indeed cover Vedic studies, it was also a renowned center for Buddhist studies, particularly Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism.  The university's curriculum encompassed a wide range of subjects, including Buddhist philosophy, making it a significant hub for intellectual and religious discourse.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Nalanda library as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," holding over nine million books across nine floors, accurately reflects the scale and significance of its collection.  This vast library was a testament to the university's academic prominence and its role as a repository of knowledge.


**8. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IVC's economy was primarily agrarian, with limited evidence of trade and commerce with other civilizations.
2.  The IVC's writing system, a pictographic script written in boustrophedon style, remains undeciphered.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While agriculture was undoubtedly crucial to the IVC's economy, evidence strongly suggests significant trade and commerce with other civilizations.  The discovery of items from Mesopotamia and other regions in IVC sites indicates extensive trade networks.  The sophisticated urban planning and standardized weights and measures also point to a developed economic system beyond simple subsistence farming.

Statement 2 is correct. The IVC's writing system, a pictographic script written in boustrophedon style (alternating directions of writing), remains undeciphered to this day. This poses a significant challenge to understanding the civilization's social structures, beliefs, and history. The undeciphered script represents a major area of ongoing research.


**9. With reference to Lothal and the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC), consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, located near the Gulf of Khambat, is a significant IVC site known for its advanced irrigation system and extensive agricultural practices.
2. The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode to showcase India's rich maritime heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lothal was indeed a significant IVC site located near the Gulf of Khambat, its primary claim to fame is not its irrigation system or agricultural practices, but rather its remarkably well-preserved dockyard, which is among the oldest known man-made dockyards.  This highlights the sophistication of IVC maritime technology.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMHC at Lothal is indeed being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.  The project aims to showcase India's rich maritime history, with Lothal's significance as a major port city of the IVC being a central aspect.


**10. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, launched in 1924, was a non-violent protest against the discriminatory practice of untouchability in the princely state of Travancore.
2. Mahatma Gandhi's direct involvement and leadership were crucial for the success of the Vaikom Satyagraha, leading to the immediate removal of all restrictions on temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva temple in the princely state of Travancore (present-day Kerala).  The movement highlighted the deeply entrenched caste system and its impact on social justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the Vaikom Satyagraha and offered his moral backing, he was not directly involved in its day-to-day leadership.  The movement was primarily led by local activists and leaders. The Satyagraha's impact was significant, but the complete removal of all restrictions on temple entry for lower-caste Hindus came later, following prolonged struggle and legal reforms. The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936 is a landmark legal outcome that followed the Vaikom Satyagraha, but it wasn't an immediate result of the Satyagraha itself.


**1. With reference to Ratan Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of India's largest employers.
2.  Tata Motors received the PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for incorporating vegan interiors in its Avinya Concept car, a move initiated during Ratan Tata's tenure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Ratan Tata's legacy at the helm of the Tata Group.  Statement 1 correctly highlights the dramatic expansion of the Tata Group's revenue under his leadership, transforming it into a global conglomerate and a significant employer in India. This substantial growth signifies his successful business acumen and strategic vision. Statement 2 is also accurate; Tata Motors, under his leadership, did indeed receive recognition from PETA India for its commitment to vegan interiors in the Avinya Concept car. This reflects Tata's broader commitment to corporate social responsibility and environmental consciousness, extending beyond purely financial goals.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna award comes with a substantial monetary grant in addition to the Sanad and medallion.
2.  Recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are formally submitted by a dedicated selection committee and then approved by the President.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect regarding the Bharat Ratna. Statement 1 is false; the Bharat Ratna does *not* include any monetary grant. It's purely an honorific award recognizing exceptional service. The prestige and recognition associated with the award are its primary value. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Prime Minister makes recommendations to the President, there isn't a formal selection committee with a structured process. The Prime Minister's recommendation carries significant weight, but the process is less formalized than the statement suggests. Therefore, the correct answer is (d), as neither statement accurately describes the Bharat Ratna's award process or associated benefits.


**3. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government initiative aimed at promoting the export of Indian cotton by providing financial incentives to farmers.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Kasturi Cotton Bharat aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton, it doesn't primarily focus on providing direct financial incentives to farmers.  Its core strategy revolves around establishing a brand with 100% traceability and certification, leveraging blockchain technology to guarantee quality and origin. This approach aims to command premium prices in the global market rather than relying on subsidies. Statement 2 is correct; TEXPROCIL is indeed the implementing agency responsible for overseeing the branding, traceability, and certification aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a collaborative initiative between the Ministry of Culture and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to promote Indian art forms.
2.  The project's first implementation focuses on showcasing traditional art forms like Thangka painting and Cheriyal painting in major metropolitan cities across India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Project PARI falls under the Ministry of Culture, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is not directly involved.  The implementing agencies are the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Statement 2 is largely correct.  The project aims to democratize art through public installations, and its initial focus is on Delhi, showcasing a range of traditional Indian art forms, including Thangka and Cheriyal painting. Although the statement mentions "major metropolitan cities across India," the initial rollout is limited to Delhi.  The core idea of promoting diverse art forms in public spaces aligns with the project's goal. Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially accurate, making (b) the correct option.


**5. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative is implemented by the Ministry of Tourism across 100 tourist destinations in India, focusing on sustainable tourism practices.
2. The program aims to empower local women by providing them with training and employment opportunities in the tourism sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Ministry of Tourism is indeed the implementing body, the initiative covers 50, not 100, tourist destinations. The focus on responsible and sustainable tourism practices aligns with the program's goals. Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of the "Paryatan Didi" aspect of the initiative is to empower local women, providing them with training and employment opportunities within the tourism sector. This contributes to both economic development and the promotion of local culture. Although statement 1 has a minor inaccuracy in the number of destinations,  the core idea is accurate.  The combination of promoting responsible tourism and empowering women through employment makes (c) the most fitting answer.  The other options ignore the significant aspects of women's empowerment within the initiative.


**6. With reference to the Memory of the World Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National, with entries exclusively from UNESCO member nations.
2.  The programme aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage and enhance public awareness of its significance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Memory of the World Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three registers (International, Regional, and National), the statement's claim that entries are *exclusively* from UNESCO member nations is inaccurate.  Many significant documents and collections from various countries, regardless of UNESCO membership status, are included in these registers.  Statement 2 is correct. The programme's fundamental goal is indeed the preservation of the world's documentary heritage and raising public awareness about its importance.  The preservation of cultural heritage is a global concern. Because only statement 2 is entirely accurate, (b) is the correct option.


**7. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to a maximum of five writers in recognition of their lifetime achievements in various Indian languages.
2. Ruskin Bond is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, considered the highest honour conferred by the Akademi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is not awarded annually with a fixed limit of five recipients.  It's conferred on select writers who have made exceptional and lasting contributions to literature, and the number of recipients varies. The award is not limited to any particular number of writers. Statement 2 is correct. Ruskin Bond is indeed a recipient of this prestigious fellowship, considered the Akademi's highest honour.  This recognition highlights his significant contributions to Indian literature. Since only statement 2 is accurate, the correct option is (b).


**8. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when the first Buddhist council was convened in Rajgriha, Bihar.
2.  The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), annually observes IAD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates the descent of Lord Buddha from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not the first Buddhist council. The first Buddhist council took place in Rajgriha after the Buddha's death.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), does observe IAD annually. This reflects the importance of Buddhism in India's cultural heritage.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to the ancient Indian universities, consider the following statements:**

1. Vikramshila University, known for its emphasis on Buddhist studies, was located in present-day Uttar Pradesh.
2. Nagarjunakonda University, named after the renowned Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, was a prominent center for Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vikramshila University was located in Bihar, not Uttar Pradesh.  It was a significant center of Buddhist learning.  Statement 2 is correct. Nagarjunakonda, named after Nagarjuna, was indeed a prominent center for Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism.  Its significance in Buddhist history is well-documented.  Given that only statement 2 is accurate, the correct answer is (b).


**10. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's architecture is a unique blend of Dravida and Nagara styles, showcasing a distinct Kalinga architectural sub-style.
2.  The Ratna Bhandar, the sacred treasury of the temple, was recently reopened after a period of 46 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the temple displays elements of Kalinga architecture, it's not a direct blend of Dravida and Nagara styles.  Its architecture is unique and doesn't fit neatly into existing classifications. Statement 2 is correct.  The Ratna Bhandar, the temple's treasury, was indeed reopened after being closed for 46 years. This event received considerable attention.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.


**11. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Padma Awards are conferred annually on Republic Day and Independence Day.
2.  The awards are typically not conferred posthumously, with exceptions made only in rare and highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Padma Awards are announced annually on Republic Day, not on Independence Day.  The conferment ceremony might occur later. Statement 2 is correct.  Padma Awards are usually not given posthumously, but exceptions are made in cases of extraordinary merit. This reflects the general principle of recognizing living individuals for their contributions.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**12. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Culture to recognize outstanding contributions in the field of arts and culture.
2.  The awards are based on "Anubhav Write-ups," experiences shared by retiring central government employees on a designated portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are not presented by the Ministry of Culture; instead, they are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare.  The awards recognize the experiences of retiring government employees, not contributions to arts and culture.  Statement 2 is correct.  The awards are indeed based on the "Anubhav Write-ups," which are accounts of experiences shared by retiring central government employees.  The goal is to learn from their service.  Because only statement 2 is accurate, (b) is the correct answer.


**13. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest gallantry award, followed by the Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, and Kirti Chakra in descending order of precedence.
2.  Gallantry Awards are announced only once a year on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The order of precedence of gallantry awards is accurately stated: Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and so on.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year—once on Republic Day and again on Independence Day.  This reflects the continuous recognition of bravery.  Since only statement 1 is accurate, (a) is the correct answer.


**14. With reference to the Kanyakumari Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The temple is dedicated to Goddess Kanyakumari, an incarnation of Goddess Parvati.
2. It is believed that the temple is situated on a rock where Goddess Kanyakumari prayed to Lord Shiva.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The Kanyakumari Temple is indeed dedicated to Goddess Kanyakumari, who is considered an incarnation of Goddess Parvati.  The temple's location on a rock is also associated with the belief that Goddess Kanyakumari performed penance there, praying to Lord Shiva.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the temple's history and religious significance. The correct answer is (c).


**15. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 significantly promoted the Advaita Vedanta philosophy.
2. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which primarily focuses on promoting spiritual practices through meditation and yoga.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions was indeed instrumental in introducing Vedanta philosophy to the West and garnered significant attention for the Advaita system.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While he did establish the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, its activities extend far beyond solely promoting spiritual practices through meditation and yoga. The Mission engages in extensive social service, including running hospitals, schools, and other charitable works. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct option.


**16. With reference to the  Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha Famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," was primarily caused by a devastating earthquake that destroyed crops and infrastructure.
2. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, the then Commissioner of the Odisha division, is widely criticized for his inadequate response to the famine.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the famine is known as "Na-Anka," meaning "without numbers" in Odia, it wasn't primarily caused by an earthquake. The causes were a combination of factors, including administrative negligence, natural disasters, and economic issues.  Statement 2 is correct.  Thomas Edward Ravenshaw's response to the famine is widely criticized as inadequate, contributing to the severity of the crisis.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**17. With reference to the Battle of Saragarhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army and Afghan forces in 1897.
2.  The 21 Sikh soldiers who fought in the battle were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest British gallantry award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Battle of Saragarhi was indeed fought in 1897 between the British Indian Army (specifically, the 36th Sikh Regiment) and Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen, not Afghan forces.  The location was in the North-West Frontier Province (present-day Pakistan). Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross was awarded to British soldiers. Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct, making (a) the correct option.  The distinction between the awards is crucial.


**18. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's architecture is a unique blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.
2. The Vajrasana, a polished sandstone platform, marks the spot where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple's architecture is primarily in the classical Indian temple style with a curvilinear shikhara, but it doesn't represent a direct blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.  Its style is unique. Statement 2 is correct. The Vajrasana, the diamond throne, is a significant feature of the temple complex, marking the spot where Buddha attained enlightenment. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The architectural style of the temple is a distinct characteristic needing precise understanding.


**19. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor connects Dera Baba Nanak in India to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan.
2. The agreement on the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor was recently extended indefinitely, ensuring unrestricted access for Sikh pilgrims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor does indeed facilitate pilgrimage between Dera Baba Nanak in India and Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement was recently extended for five years, not indefinitely. While the extension is significant, it doesn't guarantee unrestricted access for all time.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer. The details of the agreement's duration are important for accurate understanding.



**1. With reference to the Chola Dynasty's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions primarily focused on establishing trade routes with Southeast Asia, leading to the flourishing of Nagapattinam as a key trading center.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola control over the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, enriching the kingdom's resources and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but oversimplifies Rajaraja Chola I's naval endeavors. While Nagapattinam did flourish as a major trading center under his reign, his naval expeditions were not solely focused on trade route establishment.  His military campaigns extended to the destruction of the Chera navy and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka, demonstrating a broader strategic objective beyond mere commerce.  Therefore, the statement presents an incomplete and somewhat misleading picture.

Statement 2 is accurate. Rajendra Chola I's military campaign against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of significant territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion demonstrably increased Chola power and access to resources in the region. This fact aligns with historical accounts of his reign.

Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the Chola dynasty's maritime activities as presented. Option (b) is thus the correct answer.  Option (a) is incorrect due to the incomplete nature of statement 1. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is not entirely accurate. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its recognition, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan, focuses exclusively on the preservation of traditional pastoralist routes in the Himalayas.
2.  The 2023 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage designation for transhumance traditions included only European practices, overlooking significant non-European examples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative does involve Himalayan transhumance practices, it's not exclusively focused on them. The initiative has a broader scope encompassing various regions and traditions associated with seasonal livestock movement.  The text mentions transhumance practices in the Himalayas and plains of India, showcasing the initiative's wider geographical reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage designation for transhumance included examples from both Europe and other regions. While the text mentions two European traditions, it does not imply the exclusion of non-European practices. UNESCO's recognition of intangible cultural heritage is global in scope.

Both statements present inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative and UNESCO's recognition of transhumance traditions. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register's 10th meeting, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, included only manuscripts from South Asian countries.
2. The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts reflects the MOW program's goal to preserve diverse literary traditions across the Asia-Pacific region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that 17 other works from the region were included alongside the three Indian literary works in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This clearly indicates the inclusion of manuscripts from various Asia-Pacific countries, not just South Asia.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MOW program aims to preserve documentary heritage worldwide, including diverse literary traditions. The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, representing different literary forms and languages, directly supports this goal of regional and global preservation of diverse cultural heritage.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.


**4. With reference to the Commonwealth Games (CWG), consider the following statements:**

1.  The reduction in the number of sports in the CWG 2026 edition reflects a shift towards prioritizing sports with greater global participation and viewership, thereby increasing the overall appeal of the games.
2. The six sports dropped from the CWG 2026 edition, including badminton, cricket, hockey, squash, table tennis, and wrestling, were among the disciplines in which India won the most medals in the 2022 CWG.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is a plausible interpretation of the reduction in sports for the CWG 2026.  While not explicitly stated in the text, the reduction from 12 to 10 sports could be driven by a strategy to enhance the games' global appeal and focus on more widely popular events.  This is a reasonable inference based on common practices in large-scale sporting events.

Statement 2 is directly supported by the text. It clearly states that six sports in which India won a significant number of medals in the 2022 CWG were dropped from the 2026 edition. This fact is explicitly mentioned, making the statement correct.

Therefore, both statements are correct, and the answer is (c).


**5.  With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented annually to recognize outstanding achievements in various fields of public service.
2.  The basis for selection of Anubhav Award recipients is the quality and impact of write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are not presented annually to recognize achievements across various public service fields.  The text specifies that the awards are based on write-ups from retiring central government employees, focusing specifically on their experiences and knowledge transfer.  The award's scope is narrower than a general recognition of public service achievements.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Anubhav Awards are based on Anubhav write-ups—the experiences shared by retiring central government employees/pensioners on the Anubhav Portal.  This directly addresses the selection criteria for the award.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**6. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC project aims to showcase India's maritime heritage from ancient times to the present, focusing primarily on the development of ports and shipbuilding technology.
2. The NMHC's location at Lothal, a significant Indus Valley Civilization site with the world's oldest known dry dock, is strategically chosen to highlight India's early maritime expertise.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but too narrow. The NMHC's aim is to showcase India's rich maritime heritage, but it's not solely focused on ports and shipbuilding. The text mentions broader aspects of maritime history. The statement is thus an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly highlights Lothal's importance as an Indus Valley Civilization site with an ancient dry dock, directly supporting the statement's claim about the strategic location choice for the NMHC.  This connection between the location and the project's aim is accurately presented.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The incomplete nature of statement 1 makes options (a), (c), and (d) incorrect.


**7. With reference to the  Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Padma Awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases where the individual made extraordinary contributions to the nation.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is the highest civilian honor among the Padma Awards, recognizing exceptional and distinguished service across various fields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Padma Awards are normally not conferred posthumously, but in highly deserving cases, the government may consider awarding it posthumously. This accurately describes the exception to the general rule.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly defines the Padma Vibhushan as the highest civilian honor among the three Padma Awards, recognizing exceptional and distinguished service.  This is a direct and accurate description of the award's ranking and purpose.

Both statements accurately reflect the information provided about the Padma Awards. Therefore, the correct answer is (c).


**8. With reference to the  Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra were instituted in 1952 and later renamed in 1967.
2.  The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are wartime gallantry awards instituted in 1950.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text states that Ashoka Chakra Class-I, Class-II, and Class-III were instituted in 1952 and renamed Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra respectively in 1967. This accurately describes the timeline and renaming of these awards.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explicitly mentions that the Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are wartime gallantry awards instituted in 1950. This information is directly stated in the provided text.

Both statements align with the facts provided, making (c) the correct answer.


**9. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" when established in 1954 and were administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals from their inception.
2. The National Film Awards are given in three categories – Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema – and include a "Most Film Friendly State" award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" when established in 1954, the text clarifies that the Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973, not from their inception. This detail makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately states that the National Film Awards are presented in three categories (Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema) and that a "Most Film Friendly State" award is also given. This information is directly supported by the text.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**10. With reference to the  UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in Bhuj, Gujarat, was awarded the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in 2023 for its innovative design and ecological efficiency.
2. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in a different category than the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was *shortlisted* for the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, not that it *won* the award.  The text does not confirm that it received the award.  This distinction is crucial.

Statement 2 is correct. The text states that the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the UNESCO’s 2023 Prix Versailles Award, implying it won in a different category than the shortlisted Smritivan Museum. The fact that both were recognized suggests that they were indeed in different categories.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, establishing a vast maritime trade network.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did consolidate Chola power on the Coromandel Coast, his naval ambitions extended far beyond. His destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and conquest of parts of Sri Lanka demonstrate a clear expansionist strategy exceeding mere coastal dominance.  His naval power was pivotal in establishing Chola control over major sea routes and trade within the Bay of Bengal.  The statement misrepresents the scope of his naval activities.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire was a landmark achievement, significantly extending Chola influence into Southeast Asia.  The conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra directly resulted in the expansion of the Chola maritime trade network, demonstrating the empire's reach and power projection capabilities far beyond the Bay of Bengal. This expansion exemplifies Chola naval dominance and its strategic importance in controlling vital trade routes. The statement accurately reflects this historical fact.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its Indian context, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a practice primarily confined to the Himalayan region, involving only the movement of livestock between high-altitude pastures and lower plains.
2. The Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes in the Himalayas who practice transhumance, involving the seasonal migration of both humans and their livestock.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it's not limited to that region.  The text explicitly mentions the practice's existence in plains regions like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement incorrectly restricts the geographical scope of transhumance in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately identifies the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas as Himalayan nomadic tribes who practice transhumance.  The description of their seasonal migration with their sheep and goats, moving between subalpine and alpine pastures in summer and adjoining plains in winter, is a precise and accurate representation of their transhumance practices.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register exclusively includes manuscripts from countries within the Asia-Pacific region, excluding works from other parts of the world.
2. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register primarily focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, the passage does not state that it *exclusively* includes manuscripts from that region.  The phrasing suggests other works may be included from outside the Asia-Pacific region, though the primary focus is on that area.  The statement's absolute claim is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This is a direct and verifiable fact from the provided text.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was established in 1927 and immediately gained recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), enabling Indian participation in the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics.
2.  The IOA's primary function is coordinating with National Sports Federations to select and send Indian teams to the Olympic Games and other international sporting events.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the IOA was formed in 1927 and recognized by the IOC in the same year. However, it does *not* state that India participated in the 1928 Olympics immediately following this recognition.  While the recognition was a crucial step, the passage doesn't confirm participation in the 1928 games.  The statement makes an unwarranted assumption based on the timing of events.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the IOA coordinates with National Sports Federations to send teams to the Olympics and other international games. This accurately describes one of the IOA's core functions. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to the T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The T20 World Cup, launched in 2007, is a tournament organized by the Cricket World Cup Committee (CWCC) and features teams from across the globe.
2. The 2024 T20 World Cup final, held in the USA and West Indies, saw India claim its third consecutive title.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the T20 World Cup is organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC), not the Cricket World Cup Committee (CWCC). The statement misidentifies the governing body for the tournament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage indicates that India won the 2024 T20 World Cup for the *second* time, not its third consecutive title.  The statement incorrectly states the number of times India has won this particular tournament.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**6. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram primarily commemorates the strategic naval role played by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the British Raj.
2.  The new name, Sri Vijaya Puram, symbolizes the victory of the Indian freedom movement and highlights the islands’ unique contribution to India's history.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the renaming acknowledges the islands' historical significance as a naval base, even for the Cholas, the primary reason cited in the passage is to commemorate the Indian freedom movement and the islands' contribution to it, particularly Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's role. The statement incorrectly emphasizes the colonial naval aspect over the freedom struggle narrative.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Sri Vijaya Puram represents the victory of the Indian freedom movement and highlights the unique contribution of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  This directly reflects the stated rationale behind the renaming.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards, established in 1954, were initially known as the "State Awards" and have been administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals since their inception.
2.  The awards are presented in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema, with a special award given to the "Most Film-Friendly State".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that the National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" and were established in 1954. However, it specifies that the Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards *since 1973*, not since their inception.  The statement contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the administration timeline.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the three award categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema. It also correctly mentions the "Most Film-Friendly State" award. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to the  Kashi Culture Pathway and the fight against illicit trafficking, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Culture Pathway initiative is a purely domestic Indian project focused solely on cultural preservation within the Varanasi region.
2. The G20 Culture Working Group endorsed the Kashi Culture Pathway as part of a global coalition to combat illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions that the Kashi Culture Pathway's outcome document was endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group as part of a global coalition against illicit trafficking. This clearly indicates an international dimension beyond a purely domestic focus. The statement misrepresents the initiative's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly states that the G20 Culture Working Group endorsed the Kashi Culture Pathway as part of a global effort to counter illicit trafficking. This accurately reflects the initiative's role in the broader international fight against such crimes. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to the  International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2015, following a proposal from India and endorsed by over 150 member states.
2. Yoga, derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," symbolizes the unity of mind and body and is considered one of the six schools of Indian philosophy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct but slightly inaccurate on the year. The UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, not 2015, following a proposal from India and endorsed by a record 175 member states (not just over 150). While the year is slightly off, the core information about the UN's proclamation and India's role is accurate enough to consider the statement largely correct in the context of a MCQ.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately defines Yoga's Sanskrit origin and its symbolic meaning.  It also correctly identifies Yoga as one of the six schools of Indian philosophy. Therefore, both statements are substantially correct.


**10. With reference to the  Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) and India's contribution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi's activities in South Africa laid the groundwork for the AAM, establishing the first anti-colonial and anti-racial discrimination movement, and founding the Natal Indian Congress in 1895.
2. India's support for the AAM primarily involved providing financial aid through the AFRICA Fund, while avoiding direct political engagement with the anti-apartheid organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The passage accurately describes Gandhi's significant role in South Africa in establishing early anti-colonial and anti-racial movements.  The year is slightly off, however, as the Natal Indian Congress was founded in 1894, not 1895. Still, the core information is accurate enough for the statement to be considered correct in the context of a MCQ.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage highlights India's multifaceted support for the AAM, including severing trade relations with the apartheid government in 1946, bringing the issue to the UN, and maintaining a representative office for the African National Congress (ANC) in New Delhi. The statement understates and misrepresents the extent and nature of India's involvement.  Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material – a compilation of diverse facts –  some questions may touch upon multiple themes.


**1. With reference to the 2024 T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The tournament was jointly hosted by the USA and the West Indies.
2.  India's victory marked their third win in the T20 World Cup.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the 2024 T20 World Cup final was held in the USA and West Indies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions India's win as their *second* victory in the tournament, not their third.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but incorrect detail (third win) serves as a strong distractor.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval expeditions extended as far as the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
2. The Chola's Look East Policy primarily focused on establishing military dominance over Southeast Asia, neglecting trade relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text explicitly details Rajendra I's successful naval campaigns reaching the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the extent of Chola naval power and their reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Chola Empire certainly pursued an aggressive military policy, their Look East Policy was also significantly driven by trade and economic interests with Southeast Asian countries. The passage highlights Nagapattinam as a key trading center. The question tests the candidate's ability to discern nuanced aspects from historical information.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem, was included in the register.
2.  The 10th MOWCAP meeting, where the inclusion of Indian literary works was decided, was held in Beijing, China.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly identifies the Ramcharitmanas as a 16th-century work, not 17th-century. This subtle chronological discrepancy is a common type of distractor in UPSC questions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This shows the importance of precise location details. The question assesses the ability to recall specific facts and resist plausible but incorrect details.


**4.  With reference to India's performance in the Paris 2024 Olympics, consider the following statements:**

1. India's medal tally in Paris was lower than its tally in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
2. India secured its best-ever Olympic performance in Paris 2024.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that India won fewer medals in Paris (six) compared to Tokyo (seven).  The question tests the ability to interpret numerical data within a larger context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clarifies that Paris 2024 was India's *third*-best Olympic performance, not the best ever. This subtle difference makes the question challenging. The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but incorrect statement is a key feature of a difficult UPSC-style MCQ.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the International Cricket Council (ICC):**

1. The ICC's headquarters are located in London, England.
2. The ICC organizes the World Test Championship.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the ICC headquarters are in Dubai, UAE, not London.  This tests geographical knowledge related to sports governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions that the ICC is responsible for organizing the World Test Championship.  The question requires precise recall of the ICC's organizational responsibilities.


**6. With reference to the  Kashi Culture Pathway and the fight against illicit trafficking, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Culture Pathway is an initiative endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group to combat the illegal trade of antiquities.
2.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is responsible for recovering antiquities only if they are traced within India's borders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions the Kashi Culture Pathway's endorsement by the G20 and its role in strengthening the fight against illicit trafficking, particularly of antiquities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the ASI coordinates and recovers antiquities if traced, implying a broader responsibility not limited to India's borders.  This seemingly minor detail makes the question more challenging.


**7. With reference to the  International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UN proclaimed IYD on the Winter Solstice.
2. India proposed the draft resolution for IYD with the support of over 170 member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that IYD is celebrated on the Summer Solstice (June 21st), not the Winter Solstice. This requires precise knowledge of the date and the astronomical event.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While the exact number might vary slightly, the text clearly indicates that India's proposal for IYD received overwhelming support from a significant number of member states (175).  The question tests the candidate's ability to handle approximate figures in a factual context.


**8. With reference to the  Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The fellowship is awarded to writers who have made significant contributions to Indian literature in any language.
2. Ruskin Bond was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship posthumously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text describes the fellowship as the highest honor for writers, implying recognition for significant literary contributions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the text mentions Ruskin Bond receiving the fellowship, it does not indicate it was posthumous. This detail makes the question more challenging and tests careful reading comprehension.


**9. With reference to the  National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially known as the "State Awards".
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1974.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards."

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Directorate of Film Festivals has been administering the awards since 1973, not 1974. This small detail acts as a distractor.  The question assesses precise recall of factual information.


**10. With reference to  the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  A bearded man statue made of bronze was found in Mohenjo-daro.
2.  The Indus script, written in a boustrophedon style, has been fully deciphered.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions a bearded man statue made of steatite (soapstone), not bronze. This difference in material is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Indus script has *not* been deciphered yet. This question tests knowledge of archaeological findings and the limitations of current understanding.  The use of seemingly plausible but inaccurate details strengthens the difficulty.


**1. With reference to megalithic structures in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalith, are characterized by their fully subterranean construction.
2.  Megalithic burials exclusively encompass chamber tombs and unchambered tombs, excluding other megalithic structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning partly underground, not fully subterranean.  The description in the source material clearly states they are "semi-subterranean."  A fully subterranean structure would be entirely below ground level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The source explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths *not* connected with burials. This demonstrates that the classification of megalithic structures extends beyond just burial sites.  The existence of a third category refutes the claim that megalithic burials are limited to the first two types.  The question attempts to mislead by focusing only on burial-related megaliths.


**2. With reference to the Phanigiri site in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Phanigiri site primarily showcases architectural remnants of a pre-Buddhist era, predating the Satavahana period.
2.  Archaeological findings at Phanigiri unequivocally confirm the exclusive presence of the Mahayana sect of Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the site is significant, the provided text clearly indicates the discovery of  Brahmi label inscriptions from both the Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods (2nd-3rd Century AD), placing it firmly within, or at least overlapping with,  known Buddhist periods.  The question attempts to place the site in a much earlier, inaccurate timeframe.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The source material explicitly states that the thorana's panel shows the co-existence of both Mahayana and Hinayana sects at Phanigiri.  The question wrongly asserts the exclusive presence of only one sect.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bavikonda Monastery complex exclusively features architectural styles and elements characteristic of Mahayana Buddhism.
2.  The monastery's name, "Bavikonda," directly translates to "hill of stupas," reflecting its primary architectural feature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that Bavikonda is a *Theravada* (Hinayana Buddhism) complex. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of exclusive Mahayana features. The question uses misleading terminology to confuse the examinee.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The source clarifies that "Bavikonda" means "hill of wells," referring to its historical water sources, not stupas.  The question plays on the similar-sounding words "wells" and "stupas" to create a plausible but incorrect distractor.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval campaigns were primarily focused on land-based conquests within the Indian subcontinent, with limited maritime activity.
2. Rajendra Chola I's significant naval victory against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the complete annexation of the Malay Peninsula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly details Rajaraja Chola I's significant naval expeditions, including the destruction of the Chera navy and conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  The question downplays the scale and importance of his naval power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra Chola I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire led to the conquest of *several regions* in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, it did not result in the *complete* annexation of the entire Malay Peninsula. The question exaggerates the extent of the conquest to create a false statement.


**5. With reference to Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a practice primarily confined to the Himalayan region, with minimal presence in the plains of India.
2.  The movement of livestock during transhumance involves only the seasonal migration of animals, without any human communities relocating.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the transhumance system exists in both the Himalayas and the plains of several Indian states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The question tries to limit the practice to a specific geographical area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of transhumance provided in the text explicitly mentions the migration of *human communities* along with their herds. This makes the statement incorrect by omitting a crucial aspect of the practice.


**6. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register exclusively includes manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, excluding any works from other parts of the world.
2.  The Ramcharitmanas, included in the register, is a 17th-century epic poem written in Sanskrit.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the inclusion of 17 other works from the region is mentioned,  the fact that three Indian literary works were included alongside them suggests that the register is not exclusive to the Asia-Pacific region. The question attempts to create a false sense of exclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text correctly identifies the Ramcharitmanas as a 16th-century poem, not a 17th-century one, and specifies that it is written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit. The question alters key factual details to create an incorrect statement.


**7. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra is primarily associated with the first Dhyani Buddha, Vairocana, symbolizing compassion.
2.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra symbolizes the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment through meditation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Abhaya Mudra is displayed by the *fifth* Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, and symbolizes fearlessness, not compassion. The question misrepresents the Buddha and the meaning of the mudra.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bhumisparsha Mudra is related to overcoming Mara,  the text explains that it symbolizes calling the earth to witness, not the attainment of enlightenment through meditation. The question misinterprets the meaning and context of the mudra.



**8. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the unrestricted import of archaeological material from India into the United States.
2.  The 1970 UNESCO Convention plays a supplementary role,  providing an international framework for the CPA's implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPA's stated aim is to *prevent and curb* the illicit trafficking of antiquities, not to facilitate unrestricted import. The question presents the opposite of the agreement's objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention as a *global-level effort* to combat illicit trafficking, implying a complementary, not supplementary, role to the CPA's national-level focus. The question misrepresents the relationship between the two agreements.


**9.  With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD to coincide with the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.
2.  The proposal for IYD was initiated by China and subsequently endorsed by a majority of UN member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly states that June 21st (Summer Solstice) was chosen, not the winter solstice. The question confuses the solstices to create a false statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The source clearly attributes the proposal for IYD to India, not China.  The question substitutes a different nation to create a misleading statement.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Saluva Dynasty's rule marked the peak of the Vijayanagara Empire's territorial expansion and political influence.
2.  The Amara-Nayakas were primarily responsible for collecting taxes and managing irrigation works within their assigned territories, with no military responsibilities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Saluva Dynasty, saw the empire reach its zenith. The question uses a different dynasty to create an incorrect statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Amara-Nayakas were *military commanders* who were given territories to rule.  Their responsibilities included both tax collection and military duties. The question incorrectly omits their military role.


**11. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Admissions to Nalanda University were based solely on a rigorous entrance examination, with no consideration for social status or background.
2.  The university's library, "Dharma Gunj," was primarily composed of Buddhist scriptures, excluding other religious or secular texts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that admissions were "strictly by merit," implying a meritocratic system based on examinations conducted by trained gatekeepers.  The question accurately reflects this aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the library's vast collection is mentioned, the source does not specify that it only contained Buddhist scriptures. The vast size of the library and the mention of nine million books across nine floors suggests a diverse collection covering various subjects. The question creates a misleading assumption about the library's content.


**12. With reference to the Chandravalli Cave Complex, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chandravalli Cave Complex exhibits architectural features exclusively from the Vijayanagara period, showing no influence from other dynasties or eras.
2. The complex's name, "Ankali Math," is primarily associated with its historical function as a royal palace.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions artifacts and influences from several periods, including Satavahana, Hoysala, Vijayanagara, Roman, and Chinese periods.  The question falsely claims exclusive Vijayanagara influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text identifies "Ankali Math" as an alternative name for the complex, but it associates the complex with saints using it for meditation and possibly as an educational center (Gurukul), not as a royal palace. The question misinterprets the alternative name's implication.


**13. With reference to Classical Languages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India's recognition of Classical Languages is based solely on the age of the language and its literary heritage.
2.  The recent inclusion of Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali as Classical Languages marks the first time such recognition has been extended since 2004.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While age and literary heritage are important factors, the criteria for classical language status are not solely based on these elements. Other factors, such as the language's influence and contribution to the development of other languages, are also considered. The question simplifies the selection criteria.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the 2004 decision marked the *first time* a new category of classical languages was created.  The recent inclusion is an *addition* to this already established category, not the first time such recognition has occurred since 2004. The question misrepresents the historical context of the decision.


**1. With reference to megalithic burial practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic chamber tomb, are exclusively found in the southern regions of India.
2.  Megalithic burials are solely associated with the Iron Age, indicating a direct correlation between the development of iron metallurgy and burial practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While dolmenoid cists are prevalent in South India, their distribution isn't exclusive to that region.  Megalithic burial sites with variations in their construction are found across India, reflecting regional differences in culture and technology. The statement incorrectly restricts the geographical distribution of dolmenoid cists.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The association of megalithic burials with the Iron Age is a simplification. While iron tools and artifacts are often found in megalithic contexts, the origins of megalithic traditions predate the widespread use of iron in many regions.  The Neolithic-Chalcolithic periods also saw the development of megalithic burial practices, demonstrating that the technology and the burial customs didn't develop simultaneously or exclusively. The chronological overlap between megalithic culture and the Iron Age is complex and varies regionally.


**2. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. Located near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, the Bavikonda Monastery is a significant example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture.
2.  The name "Bavikonda" translates to "hill of wells," reflecting the presence of ancient water harvesting structures at the site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bavikonda Monastery showcases Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana. While both schools of Buddhism coexisted in some regions of India, Bavikonda's architectural features and discovered artifacts point to a Theravada Buddhist complex. The statement incorrectly attributes the site to the wrong school of Buddhism.

Statement 2 is correct. The name "Bavikonda" literally means "hill of wells," a direct reflection of the historical presence of numerous wells used for rainwater harvesting. This detail highlights the practical aspects of the monastery's construction and its adaptation to the local environment.


**3. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its cultural legacy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, which resulted in the Mauryan annexation of Kalinga, led to the immediate and widespread adoption of Buddhism throughout the Kalinga region.
2. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty, is primarily known for his patronage of Hinduism, evidenced by the extensive construction of Hindu temples during his reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War and Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism are significant historical events, the immediate and widespread adoption of Buddhism in Kalinga following the war is an oversimplification.  The religious landscape of Kalinga remained diverse, with Jainism and other traditions continuing to thrive alongside Buddhism. The statement presents an inaccurate portrayal of the immediate religious impact of the war.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kharavela, though a significant patron of the arts and culture, is primarily associated with his patronage of Jainism.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, built during his reign, are renowned for their Jain sculptures and inscriptions.  The statement incorrectly attributes his patronage primarily to Hinduism.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Ahom Dynasty:**

1.  The Ahom kings held absolute power, with the Council of Ministers playing a minimal role in governance.
2.  The Ahom Dynasty's cultural influence is primarily visible in the adoption and propagation of Buddhism throughout Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom kings were monarchs, their power wasn't absolute. The Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris) held considerable influence, and their concurrence was essential for key decisions, including the appointment of kings. The statement misrepresents the balance of power within the Ahom administration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ahom Dynasty's cultural influence in Assam is evident in the adoption and patronage of both Shaivism and the Shakti movement.  While they did patronize some Buddhist sites, their religious impact is more accurately described as a blend of various religious traditions, with Hinduism playing a significant role. The statement provides an incomplete and inaccurate description of their religious influence.


**5. With reference to the Moidams of the Tai-Ahoms, consider the following statements:**

1. Moidams are exclusively earthen mounds, without any structural elements of stone or brick.
2. The annual ritual of Me-Dam-Me-Phi, a form of ancestor worship, is no longer practiced among the Tai-Ahoms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Moidams are complex structures that include earthen mounds (Ga-Moidam), but also incorporate octagonal walls (Garh) and brick-and-stone vaults (Tak). The statement oversimplifies the architectural complexity of Moidams.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Me-Dam-Me-Phi ritual, a significant form of ancestor worship, continues to be practiced by the Tai-Ahoms, demonstrating the enduring cultural continuity associated with Moidam traditions.  The statement incorrectly claims the discontinuation of a vital cultural practice.


**6. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus script has been fully deciphered, revealing detailed information about their social and political structures.
2.  The discovery of standardized weights and measures provides evidence of a well-organized trade network within and beyond the Indus region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indus script remains undeciphered, hindering our complete understanding of their social and political organization.  While significant progress has been made in identifying some symbols, a comprehensive understanding of their meaning and the overall script remains elusive. The statement falsely claims complete decipherment.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of standardized weights and measures in various Indus Valley Civilization sites strongly suggests a well-developed and organized trade network, both internally and with other regions. This evidence points to sophisticated administrative and economic systems.


**7. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. There is only one Sangameshwar Temple in India, located in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh.
2. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Multiple Sangameshwar Temples exist in India, located in different states such as Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.  The statement incorrectly limits the number of temples to one.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu. The statement incorrectly attributes the temple to the wrong deity.


**8. With reference to the Kamakhya Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is a unique blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.
2.  The Ambubachi Mela festival commemorates the annual flooding of the Brahmaputra River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is primarily characterized by the Nilachal style, which incorporates elements from Upper Burma and the Pala style of Bengal, later evolving into the Ahom style. It does not primarily reflect a blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles. The statement misrepresents the temple's architectural style.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ambubachi Mela at the Kamakhya Temple commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, not the annual flooding of the Brahmaputra River. The statement incorrectly associates the festival with a different event.


**9. With reference to Jyotirmath, consider the following statements:**

1. Jyotirmath is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Ramanujacharya.
2. Jyotirmath is situated in the state of Himachal Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Jyotirmath is one of the four cardinal mathas established by Adi Shankaracharya, not Ramanujacharya.  The statement incorrectly attributes the establishment of the matha to the wrong philosopher.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Jyotirmath is located in the state of Uttarakhand, not Himachal Pradesh. The statement incorrectly identifies the state where Jyotirmath is located.


**10. With reference to the Alagar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Alagar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped under the name Kallazhagar.
2. The temple's architecture prominently features the Vijayanagara style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alagar Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, worshipped as Kallazhagar, not Lord Shiva. The statement incorrectly identifies the deity worshipped at the temple.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the temple's architecture displays elements from various periods, the Nayaka style is more prominent than the Vijayanagara style. The statement incorrectly emphasizes the Vijayanagara style over the more dominant Nayaka style.



**1. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Satyagraha, lasting 604 days, concluded with the complete opening of all roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes.
2.  E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar), while participating actively, remained critical of the movement's limited success and its Hindu reformist framing by Mahatma Gandhi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Vaikom Satyagraha, lasting 604 days, did achieve a significant victory, it did *not* result in the complete opening of all roads to the temple. Only three out of four roads were opened to all castes following the movement's conclusion. This partial success was a source of contention for many participants.  The full opening of all access routes came later, with the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.

Statement 2 is correct. E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar), a key figure in mobilizing the Satyagraha, was indeed critical of the movement's limited success. He viewed it primarily as a struggle against caste-based atrocities rather than simply a Hindu reformist movement, a perspective that differed significantly from Mahatma Gandhi's.  This difference in interpretation contributed to a growing rift between Gandhi and Periyar, ultimately leading to Periyar's departure from the Congress.  Periyar's unique perspective underscores the complex social and political dynamics surrounding the Vaikom Satyagraha.


**2. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative utilizes blockchain technology to ensure 100% traceability and certification of Kasturi cotton, enhancing its global competitiveness.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the sole implementing agency responsible for all aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort aimed at improving the global competitiveness of Indian cotton. A key component of this initiative is the use of blockchain technology to provide complete traceability and certification of the cotton, ensuring its premium quality and origin. This transparency builds trust and confidence among international buyers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL plays a crucial role as the implementing agency, it is not the *sole* entity responsible. The initiative is a collaborative effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, various trade bodies, and the industry itself. This collaborative approach underscores the multi-faceted nature of the initiative and the shared responsibility involved in its successful implementation.  The involvement of multiple stakeholders ensures broader participation and a more holistic approach to achieving the initiative's goals.


**3. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The famine, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," primarily resulted from the complete failure of the monsoon season, leading to widespread crop failure.
2.  Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, although criticized for his role during the famine, later established numerous vernacular schools in rural Odisha, promoting the Odia language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the failure of the monsoon was a significant contributing factor to the Odisha Famine of 1866, it was not the *sole* cause. The famine's severity was exacerbated by a combination of factors, including the negligence and lack of preparedness on the part of the British administration, pre-existing economic vulnerabilities, and other natural disasters.  Attributing the famine solely to monsoon failure oversimplifies a complex interplay of factors.

Statement 2 is correct. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, the Commissioner of the Odisha division during the famine, faced criticism for his handling of the crisis.  However, in the aftermath, he undertook initiatives to improve the educational infrastructure in rural Odisha.  He established a significant number of vernacular schools, focusing on the Odia language, and also upgraded Cuttack Zilla School into Ravenshaw College.  This demonstrates a complex legacy, with both negative and positive aspects associated with his tenure.


**4. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra, signifying fearlessness, is exclusively associated with the depiction of Buddha in his seated meditative posture.
2.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra, another significant Buddhist mudra, represents the act of preaching the Dharma.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra does symbolize fearlessness and is often associated with Buddha, it is not *exclusively* linked to his seated meditative posture.  The mudra can be depicted in various poses and is not limited to a single representation. The statement oversimplifies the diverse iconographic representations of the mudra.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra (earth-touching mudra) symbolizes Buddha's summoning of the earth as a witness to his enlightenment, overcoming Mara's temptations. The Dharmachakra Mudra (turning the wheel of Dharma) represents the preaching of the Dharma. The statement incorrectly attributes the meaning of the Bhumisparsha Mudra to the Dharmachakra Mudra.


**5. With reference to the  Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" to address instances where protected monuments cannot be located.
2.  The Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance, thereby removing their protection under the ASI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* contain a formal definition for "Missing Monuments." This term emerged later in discussions surrounding the status of untraceable monuments under the ASI's purview.  The absence of a formal definition highlights the evolving challenges in managing and protecting ancient monuments.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AMASR Act, 1958, does indeed grant the Central Government the authority to delist monuments that are assessed as no longer being of national importance. This provision, under Section 35 of the Act, allows for the removal of ASI protection and the potential for subsequent development or construction on the sites.  The power to delist underscores the dynamic nature of heritage preservation and the need for periodic reassessment.


**6. With reference to the  Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA was formed in 1927, with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first president, and immediately gained recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
2. India's participation in the Olympic Games commenced in 1900 in Paris, with Norman Pritchard, an Anglo-Indian, representing the nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was indeed established in 1927, with Sir Dorabji Tata serving as its inaugural president.  Crucially, the IOA received recognition from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the same year, signifying its official status within the international Olympic movement.

Statement 2 is correct. India's first participation in the Olympic Games did take place in 1900 in Paris. Norman Pritchard, an Anglo-Indian, represented India in those games.  This early participation marks a significant milestone in India's sporting history and its engagement with the global Olympic community.


**7. With reference to the  contributions of Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 was instrumental in introducing Vedanta philosophy to the West.
2.  Swami Vivekananda, a staunch advocate of traditional Indian practices, actively opposed the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's speech at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago had a profound impact on introducing Vedanta philosophy to a Western audience. His eloquent presentation of Indian spiritual thought generated significant interest and helped shape perceptions of India in the West.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda was not opposed to the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC). In fact, he played a role in inspiring Jamsetji Tata to establish the institution, promoting the integration of scientific advancements with traditional Indian values. The statement misrepresents Vivekananda's progressive views on the integration of science and spirituality.


**8.  With reference to the  Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded solely by the President of India, without any formal recommendations from other bodies.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a substantial monetary grant along with the award's medallion and certificate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India, it is not entirely without formal recommendations. Although there is no formal requirement for recommendations, the Prime Minister of India typically makes recommendations to the President for the award's bestowal. This process, although informal, ensures that the selection process involves consideration from the highest levels of government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna award does *not* come with any monetary grant. The award consists solely of a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President, accompanied by a medallion.  This practice reinforces the focus on the honor and recognition rather than material reward.


**1. With reference to Megalithic burial sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic monument, are characterized by their entirely subterranean chamber structure.
2.  Megalithic sites exclusively consist of burial structures; non-burial megaliths are not categorized within this archaeological classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are indeed chamber tombs, but they are described as *semi-*subterranean, meaning partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  The description emphasizes their partially buried nature.  A completely subterranean structure would be a different type of burial architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that there are three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials. This classification clearly indicates that not all megaliths are associated with burial practices.  The existence of non-burial megaliths is a crucial aspect of understanding the complexity and diversity of these sites.  Ignoring this aspect would represent a significant oversight in understanding megalithic culture.


**2. With reference to the Ikshvaku period in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A significant coin hoard unearthed at the Phanigiri site in Telangana belongs to the Gupta period.
2.  The Phanigiri site, known for its Buddhist structures, exhibits evidence of only the Mahayana sect of Buddhism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the coin hoard discovered at Phanigiri belongs to the *Ikshvaku* period, not the Gupta period. This distinction is crucial for understanding the chronological context of the artifacts and the broader historical narrative of the region.  Confusing these two periods demonstrates a lack of precision in historical knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The description of Phanigiri explicitly mentions that its thoranas (gateways) show evidence of *both* Mahayana and Hinayana sects coexisting at the site.  This indicates a more nuanced religious landscape than suggested by the statement, demonstrating a richer understanding of the religious practices of the time.  Restricting the site's religious affiliation to only one sect overlooks important historical details.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. Located near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, the Bavikonda Monastery is a significant site showcasing Mahayana Buddhist architecture.
2.  Due to substantial funding, the Bavikonda Monastery has received optimal maintenance and restoration in recent years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bavikonda Monastery is located near Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site, the text specifies that it is a *Theravada* (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, not Mahayana.  This distinction reflects different schools of Buddhist thought and practice, which are important for understanding the religious diversity of ancient India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that due to *budget constraints*, maintenance and repairs at the Bavikonda site have been suboptimal.  This highlights the challenges faced in preserving historical sites and the importance of adequate funding for their conservation.  Contradicting this information shows a misunderstanding of the site's current state and the difficulties in its preservation.


**4. With reference to the Chola dynasty's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but did not include Sri Lanka.
2.  Rajaraja I's naval activities primarily focused on internal conflicts within the Chola empire and did not involve significant external conquests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that Rajendra I's naval expeditions *did* include the conquest of several regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, *and* that his conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province.  The statement omits this crucial detail, demonstrating an incomplete understanding of Rajendra I's accomplishments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text highlights Rajaraja I's destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and his conquest of parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. These actions demonstrate significant external military campaigns beyond internal conflicts.  The statement misrepresents the scope of Rajaraja I's naval activities.


**5. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is a practice primarily limited to the Himalayan region of India, with no presence in the plains.
2.  The World Heritage Transhumance initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses exclusively on European transhumance traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions transhumance being prevalent in the Himalayas, it also explicitly states that this system exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  Restricting transhumance solely to the Himalayas demonstrates a limited understanding of its geographical scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the text mentions the inclusion of two European transhumance traditions in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list, it does not state that the initiative solely focuses on European traditions. The initiative's global scope is not explicitly defined in the given context but it would be inaccurate to limit its focus only to European traditions based on the given text.


**6. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem written in Bengali, was included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
2.  The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only a single, international register of documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly identifies the Ramcharitmanas as a 16th-century epic poem written in *Awadhi*, not Bengali.  This error in language and timeframe demonstrates a lack of attention to detail in recalling the literary work's specifics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that the MoW Programme maintains *three* registers: International, Regional, and National.  This information reflects the program's multi-tiered approach to preserving documentary heritage.  Claiming the existence of only one register misrepresents the program's organizational structure.


**7. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its cultural legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in the expansion of the Kalinga dynasty's territory and strengthened its political influence.
2.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, built during the 2nd century BCE, are primarily associated with Buddhist religious practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in the *Mauryan Empire's* annexation of Kalinga, not the expansion of the Kalinga dynasty.  This shows a misunderstanding of the major historical event and its impact on the political landscape of ancient India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built during the 2nd century BCE, they are explicitly described in the text as having been built by King Kharavela for *Jain* monks, not Buddhist practitioners.  This demonstrates a lack of understanding regarding the religious affiliations of the caves' construction.


**8. With reference to the archaeological discoveries in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ooragutta site is a significant example of Neolithic-era settlements.
2.  The rock art site at Devarlabanda Mula features extensive depictions of human figures engaged in warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text identifies Ooragutta as an *Iron Age* megalithic site, not a Neolithic settlement.  This reflects a misunderstanding of the chronological context of the archaeological findings and the different eras of human history.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the rock art at Devarlabanda Mula features *only* depictions of animals, with no human figures or weapons.  The statement fabricates the presence of human figures and warfare, misrepresenting the discovered art.


**9. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra is a symbolic gesture primarily associated with the first Dhyani Buddha, Vairocana.
2.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra signifies the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment through meditation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the Abhaya Mudra is displayed by the *fifth* Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not Vairocana.  This error in associating the mudra with a specific Buddha demonstrates a lack of precision in understanding Buddhist iconography.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Bhumisparsha Mudra is related to the Buddha's overcoming of Mara, it specifically signifies the Buddha *calling the earth to witness* his triumph, not his attainment of enlightenment through meditation.  The statement conflates two distinct aspects of the Buddha's life and the symbolic meanings of different mudras.


**10. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1.  Located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, the museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale.
2.  The museum features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, representing a significant example of urban afforestation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the museum is indeed located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat and commemorates the victims of the 2001 earthquake, the magnitude is given as 7.9 in the text, not 7.7.  This minor discrepancy, while seemingly insignificant, underscores the importance of accuracy in recalling numerical data.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately states that the museum features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, highlighting its commitment to environmental sustainability and urban greening.


**11. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  Instituted in 1969, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented biennially to recognize outstanding contributions to Indian cinema.
2.  The award recipient receives a Golden Lotus medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize currently valued at ₹20 lakhs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented *annually*, not biennially.  This demonstrates a lack of precision in understanding the award's frequency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the award recipient does receive a Golden Lotus medallion and a shawl, the text specifies that the cash prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs.  This numerical error highlights the importance of accuracy in recalling factual data.


**12. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, primarily depict geometric patterns and abstract designs.
2.  Rock paintings from the Mesolithic period predominantly feature human figures engaged in hunting and community activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

This subtle difference is crucial for accurate historical recall. The Pandya and Chera were distinct kingdoms in South India. Confusing them demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge of Chola expansion.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Rajendra I launched a major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Such chronological inaccuracies are common distractors in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately reflects that the Panchatantra, along with other works, was included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register at the 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the award was indeed instituted in 1969 to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary,  the text specifies that it's presented annually by the *Directorate of Film Festivals*, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  This distinction demonstrates a critical understanding of the administrative structure related to Indian cinema awards.  Attributing it to the wrong ministry is a common error.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text does *not* state the date of celebration for the International Day of Older Persons.

Including a false date is a common technique used to test factual accuracy in UPSC questions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance does exist in the plains of India (as mentioned in the text), the passage emphasizes its prevalence in the Himalayas, where nomadic tribes practice seasonal livestock movement.  Restricting transhumance to the Gangetic plains is an inaccurate generalization.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023.  This demonstrates knowledge of recent UNESCO recognitions in the field of cultural heritage.  The year (2023) is a specific detail that enhances the accuracy of this statement.

More importantly, while Vedic studies were part of its curriculum, it encompassed a far broader range of disciplines including Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy.  Restricting its focus to Vedic scriptures is a significant oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that the new Nalanda University campus is designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus," highlighting its commitment to environmental sustainability.  This demonstrates an understanding of contemporary initiatives related to the university.  The "Net Zero Green Campus" designation is a key detail confirming the statement's accuracy.

The distinction between these two events is crucial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly identifies Patanjali's Yogasutra as a key source for understanding the systematic study of yoga and accurately dates it to the 2nd century BCE.  This showcases knowledge of the historical development of yoga.

**1. With reference to Ratan Tata's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of India's largest employers.
2.  Tata Motors received the PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for incorporating vegan interiors in its Avinya Concept car, a decision directly attributable to Ratan Tata's personal commitment to animal welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ratan Tata's tenure as chairman of the Tata Group saw a dramatic expansion of the conglomerate's revenue and its position as a major employer in India. This growth spanned various sectors and involved significant strategic investments and acquisitions. The substantial increase in revenue reflects his successful leadership and business acumen.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Tata Motors did receive the PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for using vegan interiors in its Avinya Concept car, attributing this solely to Ratan Tata's personal commitment is an oversimplification.  The decision likely involved a multifaceted approach including considerations of sustainability, ethical sourcing, and market trends, not just Ratan Tata's personal views.  The award recognizes the company's initiative, not necessarily a direct personal intervention by Ratan Tata.  Therefore, a direct causal link between his personal beliefs and this specific award cannot be definitively established.


**2. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India upon the formal recommendation of a dedicated selection committee composed of eminent personalities from various fields.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a substantial monetary grant in addition to the Sanad (certificate) and medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President of India grants the Bharat Ratna, there isn't a formally constituted selection committee.  The Prime Minister of India makes the recommendations to the President, although there is no formal process or set criteria publicly outlined. The selection process remains largely opaque, adding to the award's mystique and sometimes sparking debate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does not come with any monetary grant. It is purely an honorific award recognizing exceptional service to the nation.  The Sanad and medallion are the only tangible components of the award. The focus is on the prestige and recognition associated with the award, not on any financial reward.  This lack of monetary compensation underscores the award's non-material nature.


**3. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government initiative aimed at improving the quality of Indian cotton through the implementation of stringent quality control measures and the elimination of all intermediary processes in the cotton supply chain.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) serves as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced traceability and certification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat focuses on enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian cotton, but its approach isn't about eliminating intermediary processes. It emphasizes traceability and certification, not necessarily bypassing all intermediaries.  The aim is to improve the quality and value of Indian cotton by providing a premium brand with certification, not a complete overhaul of the supply chain.

Statement 2 is correct. TEXPROCIL is indeed the implementing agency for Kasturi Cotton Bharat, using blockchain technology to ensure traceability and certification of the cotton from farm to ginning.  This technology addresses issues of authenticity and quality control, contributing to the brand's premium image and global appeal.  The use of blockchain is a key aspect of the initiative's strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI's goal is to democratize art, making it more accessible to the public, not to commercialize it.  While the installations might indirectly benefit artists, the primary aim is to transform urban spaces into accessible art galleries, promoting public engagement with art, not its sale or commercial exploitation.

Statement 2 is correct. Project PARI's initial phase is focused on Delhi and aims to showcase diverse traditional Indian art forms through public installations.  The inclusion of Thangka, Cheriyal, and Alpana art demonstrates the project's commitment to representing India's rich artistic heritage and its diverse regional styles in a public setting.  The selection of art forms highlights the project's cultural objectives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative does place special emphasis on training women and youth, it's not exclusively focused on women.  It aims to develop a wider network of trained individuals capable of enhancing the tourist experience, encompassing both genders and age groups.  The emphasis on women and youth reflects a broader commitment to inclusive development, but it doesn't exclude other participants.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core objective of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is to improve the overall tourist experience by training local people to act as friendly and knowledgeable ambassadors for their destinations.  This involves providing them with the necessary skills to act as guides, storytellers, and welcoming hosts, thus creating a more enriching and memorable experience for tourists. This approach aligns with the broader goal of promoting responsible tourism.


**6. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's legacy, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of the World's Religions was indeed a landmark event that brought Vedanta philosophy to a global audience. His eloquent presentation sparked significant interest in Indian spirituality in the West and contributed significantly to the subsequent spread of yoga and meditation practices globally. His charismatic personality and effective communication played a key role in this process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission was a significant contribution, it's inaccurate to characterize it as solely dedicated to spiritual guidance and traditional Hindu practices. The Ramakrishna Mission engages in extensive social service activities, including running hospitals, schools, and educational institutions, demonstrating a broader commitment to societal well-being beyond purely religious pursuits.  Its activities reflect a holistic approach encompassing spiritual and social dimensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement, it wasn't solely led by him.  Moreover, the Satyagraha didn't immediately achieve complete access to the temple.  The initial success was partial, with only some roads leading to the temple being opened to all castes. Full access was achieved later through legal reforms, highlighting the movement's long-term impact.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vaikom Satyagraha garnered support from various religious communities, reflecting its broader appeal beyond caste lines.  The involvement of Christians and Muslims demonstrates the movement's inclusive nature and its appeal to those seeking social justice and equality, regardless of religious affiliation. This inter-religious support underscores the movement's significance in promoting broader social harmony.


**8. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. Karl Marx, in his writings, characterized the Santhal Rebellion as a localized uprising with minimal impact on British colonial administration in India.
2. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876, enacted by the British, aimed to protect Santhal land rights by restricting land transfers from Santhals to non-Santhals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Karl Marx did indeed refer to the Santhal Rebellion, but he viewed it as India's first organized mass revolution, not a localized event.  His assessment highlights the rebellion's significance as a large-scale challenge to British rule, not a minor incident.  His interpretation underscores the rebellion's impact on colonial power structures.

Statement 2 is correct. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 was a direct response to the Santhal Rebellion.  The British, aiming to quell further unrest and manage the situation, enacted this legislation to protect Santhal land rights by restricting land transfers to non-Santhals. This act represents a significant change in colonial policy, demonstrating the rebellion's influence.


**9. With reference to the Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha Famine of 1866 was primarily caused by widespread droughts, with minimal contribution from administrative failures or economic factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While droughts were a significant contributing factor to the Odisha Famine of 1866, it's inaccurate to attribute it solely to natural causes.  Administrative failures and existing economic vulnerabilities played a crucial role in exacerbating the impact of the drought, leading to widespread suffering and loss of life.  The famine highlights the complex interplay of natural and human factors in disaster situations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Odisha Famine prompted the construction of the Puri Canal (or Coast Canal) as a response to the crisis.  This initiative aimed to improve irrigation infrastructure and enhance water availability in the region, thereby reducing the vulnerability of the population to future droughts and famines.  The canal's construction reflects a post-disaster effort to improve infrastructure and resilience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought against Afridi and Orakzai Pashtun tribesmen, not Afghan forces.  While the British ultimately prevailed in the larger Tirah Campaign, the battle itself is remembered for the heroic last stand of the Sikh soldiers, not a decisive British victory in a straightforward military sense.  The distinction between the tribesmen and the Afghan army is crucial for understanding the context of the battle.

Statement 2 is correct. All 21 Sikh soldiers who fought at Saragarhi were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, the highest gallantry award given to Indian troops by the British at that time.  This recognition underscores their extraordinary courage and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds.  The award highlights the exceptional bravery demonstrated during this historical battle.


**1. With reference to the Memory of World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MoW Programme was indeed launched in 1992, its aim is broader than just digitization.  It focuses on preserving the world's documentary heritage, enabling universal access to it, and raising public awareness.  Digitization is a *method* of achieving these goals, not the sole objective. The programme aims to preserve heritage in various forms, not just digital.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The International Register of the MoW Programme includes significant documentary heritage from various countries, not limited to UNESCO member states alone.  The selection criteria prioritize the importance and vulnerability of the documents, not the political affiliation of the originating country. The inclusion of Indian entries like Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection exemplifies this.


**2. With reference to the literary work *Ramcharitmanas*, consider the following statements:**

1.  *Ramcharitmanas*, composed in the 17th century, is a poetic retelling of the Mahabharata in the Awadhi language.
2. The epic poem is structured into seven Kāndas (cantos), each narrating a distinct phase of Rama's life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. *Ramcharitmanas* was written in the 16th century, not the 17th, by Goswami Tulsidas.  More importantly, it is a retelling of the *Ramayana*, not the *Mahabharata*. The confusion might arise from the similar epic nature of both works, but they narrate different stories.

Statement 2 is correct.  The *Ramcharitmanas* is indeed structured into seven Kāndas, each covering a significant stage in Rama's life, from his birth to his coronation and beyond.  This seven-part structure is a key element of the work's organization and narrative flow.


**3. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

2. Ruskin Bond is among the recipients of this fellowship, which is considered the highest honor conferred by the Akademi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is not awarded annually to emerging writers. It is a lifetime achievement award reserved for established writers of exceptional stature, considered "immortals of literature."  The focus is on recognizing a lifetime of contribution, not early potential.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ruskin Bond is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, a testament to his significant and lasting contribution to Indian literature. The fellowship's prestige underlines its status as the Akademi's highest honor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha descended from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka (celestial realm) to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh, not his attainment of enlightenment.  The two events are distinct and significant milestones in Buddhist history.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), does indeed observe IAD annually, highlighting its cultural and religious significance.


**5. With reference to the architectural features of the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jagamohana, the assembly hall, is built in the Rekha Deula style, characterized by a curvilinear tower (shikhara).
2. The temple’s outer walls feature carvings depicting 24 forms of Vishnu, including Keshava, Madhava, Damodara, and Narayana.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Vimana or Deula (the main shrine) is built in the Rekha Deula style with a curvilinear tower. The Jagamohana, the assembly hall, is built in the Pidha Deula style, characterized by tiers of diminishing platforms (pidhas) forming the sikhara, not a curvilinear one.

Statement 2 is correct. The outer walls of the main temple do indeed feature carvings depicting 24 forms of Vishnu, including those mentioned. This is a significant artistic and religious element of the temple's architecture.


**6. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest shrine was built in the 14th century CE by the Vijayanagara kings.
2.  The temple showcases a blend of Dravida and Nagara styles of temple architecture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Inscriptions suggest that the earliest shrine at Virupaksha Temple was constructed much earlier, in the 8th century CE, by Chalukyan Queen Lokamahadevi. The Vijayanagara kings significantly expanded and embellished the temple, but its origins predate them considerably.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is primarily an example of Dravida style architecture, characterized by its gopurams, vimana, and pillared halls. While influences from other styles might be present in some details, the dominant style is unequivocally Dravidian.


**7. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE resulted in the annexation of Kalinga by the Gupta Empire, leading to the conversion of Chandragupta Maurya to Buddhism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE led to the annexation of Kalinga by the *Mauryan*, not the Gupta Empire.  It was Ashoka, the Mauryan emperor, who converted to Buddhism after witnessing the war's brutality, not Chandragupta Maurya.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela, a significant ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty (Meghavahana dynasty), is indeed known for his patronage of Jainism and the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.  The Hathigumpha inscription provides valuable insights into his reign and achievements.


**8. With reference to the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ooragutta is a Neolithic site featuring rock art depicting human figures engaged in hunting and warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site, not a Neolithic site. While it's an important archaeological find, the description of its rock art is inaccurate.  The statement incorrectly attributes hunting and warfare scenes to Ooragutta.

Statement 2 is correct. The rock art at Devarlabanda Mula is indeed distinctive for its focus on animals, lacking the typical human or weapon depictions found in other sites of the region. This unique characteristic makes it a significant discovery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagara style is prevalent in *North* India, not South India.  Furthermore, while it features a curvilinear shikhara, Nagara temples typically *lack* large water reservoirs unlike Dravidian temples.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vesara style is indeed a hybrid style that blends features of both Nagara and Dravidian architecture. Its patronage by the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Hoysalas is well-documented, reflecting its regional prominence.


**10. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty, founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, was succeeded by the Tuluva Dynasty, during whose rule the empire reached its zenith.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas were military commanders, not just tax collectors. More importantly, their positions were *hereditary*, not temporary. They were given territories to govern and collected taxes, retaining a portion for their personal use and administrative expenses.


**11. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, born in 1726, became the Queen of Malwa after the death of her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was born in 1725, not 1726.  While she did become the Queen of Malwa after the death of her father-in-law, the statement's phrasing is slightly inaccurate. She ascended to power after the death of both her husband and father-in-law.

Statement 2 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar is indeed widely recognized for her patronage of arts and literature, particularly Marathi literature.  Her support for Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi is well-documented, showcasing her cultural contributions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus script, while written in a boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), has *not* been fully deciphered.  Its meaning and the details of the civilization's religious beliefs and social structures remain largely unknown despite ongoing research efforts.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mesopotamian records do indeed refer to the Indus region as Meluha and mention Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) as crucial intermediate trading stations in the extensive trade network connecting the Indus civilization with Mesopotamia.


**13. With reference to the Lothal archaeological site, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lothal, situated on the banks of the Saraswati River, is a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization known for its advanced irrigation system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lothal is located between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat, not on the Saraswati River (the existence and precise location of the Saraswati River during the Indus Civilization period is a matter of ongoing debate).  While the Indus Valley Civilization had advanced urban planning, Lothal's prominence is primarily linked to its maritime activities, not irrigation systems.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of a man-made dry dock at Lothal is a significant finding, demonstrating the advanced maritime technology and sophisticated understanding of tides and navigation possessed by the Indus people.  This shows their seafaring capabilities and trade networks.

1. The Alagar Temple, situated on the foothills of the Alagar hills in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is mentioned in the Tamil epic, the Silappadikaram.
2. The temple's mandapam pillars showcase the Vijayanagara style of art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Alagar Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu (worshipped as Kallazhagar), not Lord Shiva. While it is mentioned in the Silappadikaram, attributing it solely to Lord Shiva is factually incorrect.  This demonstrates an incomplete understanding of the temple's principal deity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The pillars of the mandapam in the Alagar Temple are depicted in the Nayaka style of art, not the Vijayanagara style.  Confusing the artistic style reflects a lack of precision in identifying the stylistic features of the temple. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain inaccurate information about the temple's deity and artistic style.


**6. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, born in 1735, was the queen of Indore and is known for reconstructing the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Somnath Temple.
2. She patronized the Marathi poet, Moropant, who authored "Political Commentary on Ramayana and Mahabharata," and the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was indeed the queen of Malwa and known for reconstructing the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Somnath Temple, her birth year was 1725, not 1735.  The incorrect birth year shows a lack of attention to detail regarding important biographical information.

Statement 2 is correct. She did patronize both Moropant, the Marathi poet known for his works including "Political Commentary on Ramayana and Mahabharata," and the Sanskrit scholar, Khushali Ram. The accurate information about her patronage highlights her cultural contributions. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they contain an inaccurate birth year for Devi Ahilyabai Holkar.


**7. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, was initially constructed in the 1st century CE by the Gupta Empire and is built in the Dravidian architectural style.
2. The temple complex includes the Vajrasana (Diamond Throne), believed to be the spot where Buddha attained enlightenment, and the sacred Bodhi tree, considered a descendant of the original tree.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial temple at the Mahabodhi Temple site was built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE, not in the 1st century CE by the Gupta Empire. The current temple structure dates back to the 5th or 6th century CE from the late Gupta period. The architectural style is classical Indian temple architecture with a curvilinear shikhara, not the Dravidian style. This shows a significant misunderstanding of the temple's historical development and architectural features.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vajrasana (Diamond Throne) and the sacred Bodhi tree are indeed integral parts of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex. The Vajrasana marks the spot where Buddha is believed to have meditated, and the Bodhi tree is considered a descendant of the tree under which he attained enlightenment.  The accurate description highlights the importance of these elements within the Buddhist context.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the factual inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding the construction period, dynasty, and architectural style.


**8. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib is located in the district of Amritsar in India, near the international border with Pakistan.
2. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor facilitates pilgrimage to Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, which is significant for Sikhs as it marks the place where Guru Nanak Dev Ji spent his last years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib is located in the Narowal district of Pakistan, not in Amritsar, India.  The geographical location is a fundamental aspect of the corridor's function and significance.  The incorrect location indicates a lack of basic geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor does indeed facilitate pilgrimage to Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, which holds immense religious significance for Sikhs as it's where Guru Nanak Dev Ji spent his final years. This accurately reflects the religious and political importance of the corridor.  The accurate description of its religious significance demonstrates an understanding of its purpose. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the Gurdwara's location.


**9. With reference to the  Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project primarily aimed to connect the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the river Yamuna.
2.  The project involved the restoration of several smaller temples in the vicinity of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, including the Sheetla Mata Temple and the Shri Ram Temple.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project aimed to connect the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the river Ganga, not the Yamuna.  Confusing the rivers demonstrates a lack of geographical accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The project did involve the restoration and preservation of several smaller temples around the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, including the Sheetla Mata Temple and the Shri Ram Temple. This highlights the broader scope of the project beyond the main temple. The accurate information regarding the scope of restoration demonstrates an understanding of the project's impact.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the misidentification of the river connected to the temple in statement 1.


**10. With reference to the  Vishnupad Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vishnupad Temple in Gaya, Bihar, is located on the banks of the Gomti River and is dedicated to Lord Shiva, marked by his footprint on a basalt rock.
2. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu's footprint in the temple marks the spot where he subdued the demon, Hiranyakashipu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vishnupad Temple is located on the banks of the Falgu River, not the Gomti River, and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, not Lord Shiva. The footprint is of Lord Vishnu, not Lord Shiva.  The incorrect river and deity indicate a lack of precision in understanding the temple's basic characteristics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  In Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu's footprint marks the spot where he subdued the demon Gayasur, not Hiranyakashipu.  Confusing the demons demonstrates a lack of knowledge about the specific mythological narrative associated with the temple. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because both statements contain inaccurate information about the temple's location, deity, and the associated mythology.


**11. With reference to the  Chandravalli Cave Complex, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chandravalli Cave Complex, located in the Tumkur district of Karnataka, is primarily known for its association with the Mughal Empire and its architectural style.
2.  The complex features chambers including a place of worship with a Shiva linga, rooms for visitors and sadhus, and a water outlet connected to an internal tank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chandravalli Cave Complex is located in the Chitradurga district of Karnataka, not Tumkur, and its historical significance is primarily linked to pre-historic times and various dynasties like the Satavahana, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara empires, not the Mughal Empire.  The inaccurate location and historical context demonstrate a lack of awareness about the complex's historical background.

Statement 2 is correct. The complex does indeed include chambers such as a place of worship with a Shiva linga, rooms for visitors and sadhus, and a water outlet connected to an internal tank.  This accurately describes the physical features of the complex. The correct description of the chambers shows an understanding of the complex's physical structure. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the location and historical context in statement 1.


**12. With reference to the  Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves, consider the following statements:**

1. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves in Odisha are primarily known for their association with Buddhist art and architecture from the Gupta period.
2.  The Hathigumpha inscription, found in the Udayagiri caves, is carved in Brahmi script and details the military campaigns of King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While there are Vaishnavite caves in Udayagiri near Vidisha in Madhya Pradesh from the Gupta period, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha are primarily associated with Jainism, not Buddhism.  The confusion between the location and religious affiliation indicates a lack of precise knowledge about the caves.

Statement 2 is correct. The Hathigumpha inscription, located in the Udayagiri caves of Odisha, is indeed carved in Brahmi script and provides details of the military campaigns undertaken by King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty.  This accurately describes the inscription's content and historical significance. The correct information about the inscription demonstrates an understanding of its historical importance. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1 regarding the religious affiliation of the caves.


**13. With reference to the  Lothal archaeological site, consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal, situated in Gujarat, is a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization known for its advanced irrigation systems and extensive agricultural practices.
2.  The discovery of a man-made dry dock at Lothal provides insights into the maritime technology and trade networks of the Indus Valley Civilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Lothal is a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization located in Gujarat, its primary claim to fame isn't its advanced irrigation systems and extensive agriculture, though these were undoubtedly present.  The emphasis on irrigation and agriculture overstates one aspect of the site.

Statement 2 is correct. The discovery of a man-made dry dock at Lothal is a crucial piece of evidence demonstrating the advanced maritime technology and extensive trade networks of the Indus Valley Civilization. This highlights the site's significance in understanding the civilization's interaction with the sea. The accurate description of the dry dock’s significance demonstrates an understanding of Lothal's importance in maritime history.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because while statement 1 is partially correct, statement 2 is entirely accurate and adds significant information to the overall understanding of Lothal’s importance.  The combination of both statements provides a more complete picture of the site.


**1. With reference to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, born in 1720, was the queen of Malwa after the death of her husband and father-in-law.
2.  She is primarily known for her patronage of arts and reconstruction of temples including Somnath Temple and Kashi Vishwanath Temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was born in 1725, not 1720.  She became the ruler of Malwa in 1767 following the death of her husband in 1754 and her father-in-law in 1766. The slight inaccuracy in the birth year makes the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar is renowned for her significant contributions to temple architecture and the arts.  Her patronage extended to the reconstruction of prominent temples like the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi and the Somnath Temple in Gujarat. Her support for scholars like Moropant and Khushali Ram further solidifies her legacy as a patron of the arts.  The statement accurately reflects her major contributions.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Dynasty, established in the 14th century, was a theocratic monarchy with absolute power vested in the king.
2.  The Ahoms, descendants of the Tai race, adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, building numerous temples across Assam, including the Kamakhya Devi Temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom Dynasty was a monarchy, it wasn't a theocracy with absolute power vested solely in the king.  The administration was significantly influenced by a powerful Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris).  A king's appointment even required their concurrence.  There were periods where the absence of a suitable candidate resulted in a lack of a king altogether. This demonstrates a significant check on the king's absolute power, contradicting the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ahom kings, originating from the Tai race that migrated from Yunnan province in China, embraced Shaivism and the Shakti movement.  Their patronage resulted in the construction and renovation of numerous temples throughout Assam, with the Kamakhya Devi Temple being a prominent example.  This statement accurately reflects their religious and cultural influence. Thus, only statement 2 is correct.



**3. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1. The Santhal Rebellion, led by Siddho and Kanho Murmu, primarily focused on protesting against the British East India Company's revenue policies and land alienation.
2.  The rebellion, which lasted for several years, resulted in the establishment of the Santhal Parganas as a separate administrative unit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Santhal Rebellion of 1855-56, spearheaded by leaders like Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav, along with their sisters Phulo and Jhano, was a direct response to the exploitative practices of the British colonial administration and moneylenders.  The rebellion stemmed from widespread land alienation, oppressive revenue demands, and the overall subjugation of the Santhal community.

Statement 2 is also correct. Following the rebellion, the British administration, in an effort to manage the Santhal population and contain future uprisings, established the Santhal Parganas as a separate administrative territory.  This act aimed at providing a degree of autonomy and protection to the Santhals, though it didn't fully address the underlying issues that fueled the rebellion.  Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**4. With reference to the Battle of Saragarhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Saragarhi, fought in 1897, was a significant victory for the British Indian Army against a numerically superior Afghan force.
2.  The 21 Sikh soldiers who defended the Saragarhi post were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for their bravery and sacrifice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Battle of Saragarhi in 1897 involved a valiant defense by 21 Sikh soldiers of the British Indian Army against a much larger force of Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen, it was not a victory in the traditional sense.  The Sikh soldiers fought to the death, delaying the enemy advance and preventing a larger communication breakdown, but ultimately they all perished.  The battle was a tactical defeat, but a heroic stand.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Although the 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit (the highest British gallantry award available to Indian troops at that time), they were not awarded the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross was a British award, and  the Indian Order of Merit was specifically for Indian soldiers. This distinction is crucial. Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the Kozhikode's recognition by UNESCO, consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is located on the Coromandel Coast, historically significant for its spice trade.
2. Kozhikode was recognized by UNESCO as India's first "City of Literature" due to its rich literary heritage and historical contributions to Malayalam literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode (Calicut) is situated on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast. The Malabar Coast is known for its spice trade, but the geographic location specified is incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. UNESCO indeed recognized Kozhikode as India's first "City of Literature" in recognition of its rich literary history and significant contributions, particularly to the development of Malayalam literature and its historical role as a center of learning and cultural exchange.  The statement accurately reflects this recognition.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement, signed in 2019, allows visa-free travel for Indian Sikh pilgrims to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, with no restrictions on the number of visits.
2.  Pakistani Sikhs can also utilize the corridor to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India without requiring an Indian visa.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The 2019 agreement did facilitate visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims (and OCI cardholders) to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan. However, it's important to note that the agreement stipulated a same-day return, limiting the number of visits to one per day.  While there was no daily limit on the number of pilgrims, each visit was a single-day trip. The statement simplifies this aspect.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement primarily focused on facilitating the movement of Indian pilgrims to Kartarpur Sahib.  It did not grant Pakistani Sikhs visa-free access to Dera Baba Nanak in India.  They still require an Indian visa to visit. This is a key difference highlighted in the source.  Therefore, only statement 1 is essentially correct, albeit with a minor qualification.


**7. With reference to the individuals who received the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  P.V. Narasimha Rao and M.S. Swaminathan were among the recipients of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.
2. The Bharat Ratna award comes with a significant monetary grant in addition to the Sanad (certificate) and medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Both P.V. Narasimha Rao and M.S. Swaminathan are indeed among the many distinguished recipients of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. This is a factual statement easily verifiable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna award does *not* include a monetary grant.  Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion, but no financial reward is associated with the award.  This is a key point that differentiates it from many other awards. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**8. With reference to the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts were among the works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register in 2023.
2. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only an International Register of significant documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The manuscripts of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included in the Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This is a verifiable fact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MoW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  It's not limited to just an international register.  The inclusion of regional and national registers reflects the program's aim to document and preserve documentary heritage at various levels.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. With reference to the  Nelson Mandela's life and legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. Nelson Mandela, born in 1918, was the first democratically elected president of South Africa, known for his role in ending apartheid.
2.  Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his efforts in ending apartheid and promoting reconciliation in South Africa.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nelson Mandela, born in 1918, played a pivotal role in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.  He became the country's first democratically elected president in 1994, symbolizing the end of the apartheid era.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to ending apartheid, the award was conferred in 1993, not 1994.  This specific detail makes the statement factually incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**10. With reference to Bhagwan Mahavir, consider the following statements:**

1. Bhagwan Mahavir, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, is believed to have attained Nirvana in the 6th century BCE.
2.  The 2550th Bhagwan Mahaveer Nirvan Mahotsav was celebrated in 2024 to commemorate the anniversary of his Nirvana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Bhagwan Mahavir, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, is indeed believed to have attained Nirvana in the 6th century BCE. This is a well-established fact in Jain history.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 2550th Bhagwan Mahaveer Nirvan Mahotsav was celebrated in 2024, marking a significant anniversary related to his Nirvana. The celebration itself is evidence of the statement's accuracy.  Therefore, both statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, and various trade bodies, aiming to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through blockchain technology-enabled traceability and certification.
2. Project PARI, implemented by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, seeks to democratize art by creating public installations in urban landscapes, featuring diverse Indian art forms like Thangka, Cheriyal, and Alpana paintings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the objectives and implementation details of Kasturi Cotton Bharat and Project PARI.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the key players involved in Kasturi Cotton Bharat and its primary goal of improving the global market standing of Indian cotton through enhanced traceability and certification using blockchain technology.  The involvement of ginners in the production process is a crucial aspect of this initiative, ensuring quality control from the initial stages.  Statement 2 accurately describes Project PARI's aim to make art more accessible to the public through urban installations and its use of diverse Indian art forms, highlighting the involvement of Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. The inclusion of specific art forms like Thangka, Cheriyal, and Alpana further strengthens the statement's accuracy. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai and the annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
2. Rajendra Chola I extended the Chola empire's influence to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra through a significant naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval expansion. Statement 1 correctly attributes the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai (though the source mentions the *Chera* navy, not Pandya) and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka to Rajaraja Chola's reign. These were significant achievements showcasing the power of the Chola navy.  Statement 2 correctly describes Rajendra Chola I's extensive naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This demonstrates the reach and ambition of Chola naval power, extending far beyond the immediate Indian subcontinent.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**3. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses primarily on preserving the traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement in the European Alps.
2.  In India, transhumance practices are prevalent in the Himalayas and plains, involving nomadic communities like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas who migrate with their herds seasonally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative does indeed involve the recognition of transhumance traditions globally, Statement 1 is too narrow.  Although the European Alps are a significant area of focus, the initiative is not *primarily* focused on that region alone; it aims to encompass various transhumance traditions worldwide.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the presence of transhumance practices in India, specifically mentioning the Himalayan and plains regions and the nomadic communities involved.  The description of seasonal migration patterns for grazing further supports the statement's accuracy. Therefore, only Statement 2 is completely correct.


**4. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 16th-century epic poem written in Sanskrit by Goswami Tulsidas, was included in the register.
2. The Panchatantra, a collection of Indian fables, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, a text on Indian poetics, were also included in the register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the Ramcharitmanas *was* included, it's inaccurate to state it was written in Sanskrit. It was written in Awadhi. The other details are correct. Statement 2 is entirely correct; both the Panchatantra and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included in the register. These works represent significant contributions to Indian literature and poetics.  Therefore, only Statement 2 is fully accurate.


**5.  Consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has delisted 18 centrally protected monuments due to their lack of national importance, as determined by a report from the Ministry of Culture.
2. The delisting of monuments under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, removes ASI's responsibility for their conservation and protection, potentially allowing for construction and urbanization activities in those areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the situation surrounding the delisting of monuments by the ASI. Statement 1 correctly states the number of monuments delisted (18 out of 24 "untraceable" ones) and the reason for delisting—their assessed lack of national importance as per the Ministry of Culture's report. Statement 2 correctly explains the legal implications of delisting under the AMASR Act, 1958, emphasizing the removal of ASI's conservation responsibilities and the potential opening of the areas for development.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**6. With reference to the Supreme Court's new flag, insignia, and Lady Justice statue, consider the following statements:**

1. The depiction of Lady Justice, with scales and a sword, originates from Greek and Roman mythology, with the blindfold added during the Renaissance to symbolize impartiality.
2. The unveiling of the new flag and insignia was done by the Chief Justice of India, while the Lady Justice statue was unveiled by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly traces the origins of the Lady Justice imagery to Greco-Roman mythology and accurately notes the addition of the blindfold during the Renaissance as a symbol of impartiality. Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that the President unveiled the new flag and insignia, while the Chief Justice unveiled the Lady Justice statue.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Instituted in 1954, the Padma Awards are conferred annually on Republic Day and are categorized into Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.
2. The awards are typically not conferred posthumously, although exceptions are made in highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving communities like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it's not limited to that region.  The text explicitly mentions its presence in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement misrepresents the geographical scope of the practice, limiting it incorrectly to the Himalayas.  The practice, while prominent in the mountainous regions due to the necessity of seasonal grazing, is a wider phenomenon across various landscapes in India adapting to different climatic and geographical conditions.


Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance in ten European states received recognition as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023. This highlights the global acknowledgment of this pastoral practice and its cultural significance beyond a single geographical area.  This recognition by UNESCO underscores the importance of preserving traditional pastoral practices worldwide, emphasizing their cultural and historical value.

2. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains three registers: an International Register, a Regional Register, and a National Register, showcasing globally significant documentary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, the year is inaccurate; the inclusion happened at the 10th meeting of the MOWCAP, but the provided year is wrong. Secondly, the location is incorrect; the meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China.  These details are crucial for accurate recall of the event and demonstrate the importance of precise factual knowledge in UPSC-style questions.  Minor inaccuracies in dates and locations can significantly alter the understanding of historical and cultural events.


Statement 2 is correct. The provided text accurately states that the MOW Programme, established in 1992, maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National. This structure reflects the hierarchical approach to preserving documentary heritage, starting from the local level (national) and progressing to regional and global recognition (international). This organizational structure is important to understand the scope and impact of the program.


**3. With reference to the Jalvahak scheme, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two points. First, the reimbursement percentage is inaccurate; it is 35%, not 40%. Second, the minimum distance requirement is incorrectly stated as 200 km; it’s actually 300 km.  These discrepancies highlight the need for precise information recall in answering UPSC-level questions.  Even minor factual errors can lead to incorrect conclusions.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. The duration is wrongly stated as five years; the text specifies an initial validity period of three years. This again emphasizes the importance of precise recall of facts and figures related to government schemes and initiatives.  The duration of a scheme is a critical parameter for evaluating its long-term impact and effectiveness.


**4. With reference to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Programme of India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The managing body is wrongly identified as ONGC; it's actually the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Limited (ISPRL).  The launch year is also slightly off; it was 2004, not 2005. These errors show the importance of precise information in answering questions related to government programs and their implementation.


Statement 2 is correct. The provided text accurately mentions the total storage capacity of 5.33 MMT and correctly lists the three storage locations: Visakhapatnam, Mangaluru, and Padur. This demonstrates the importance of remembering key data points associated with national infrastructure projects.


**5. With reference to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) 2023-24, consider the following statements:**

2.  The survey encompasses rural and urban areas across India (excluding villages in Andaman and Nicobar Islands), covering manufacturing, trade, and other services (excluding construction).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The growth rate is misrepresented as 10%; the actual growth reported was 12.84%. The time period is also slightly inaccurate; it is October 2023 – September 2024, not October 2022 to September 2023.  These errors highlight the significance of accurate data recall in evaluating economic surveys and their findings.


Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly describes the geographical coverage of ASUSE (excluding Andaman and Nicobar villages) and the sectors included (manufacturing, trade, and other services excluding construction).  This demonstrates the need for a clear understanding of the scope and limitations of such surveys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Ratan Tata's leadership saw a dramatic expansion of the Tata Group's revenue, a significant increase from a reported $5 billion to over $100 billion. This growth solidified the Tata Group's position as a major economic force in India and a significant employer.  The substantial revenue increase reflects successful business strategies and diversification across various sectors.

Statement 2 is also correct. Tata Motors, under Ratan Tata's oversight, indeed received the PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award for its innovative use of vegan materials in the interior design of its AVINYA Concept car. This award highlights the group's commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainable practices, an increasingly important factor in global business and consumer preferences.  The choice of vegan interiors reflects a broader environmental and ethical corporate social responsibility approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bharat Ratna is indeed conferred by the President of India for outstanding contributions across various fields,  formal recommendations are *not* mandatory. The Prime Minister of India makes recommendations to the President, but a formal process isn't strictly enforced. This highlights the discretionary nature of the award's selection process.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bharat Ratna award bestows upon recipients a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion. However, it is explicitly stated that no monetary grant accompanies the award. This emphasizes the prestigious, non-financial nature of the honor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative explicitly empowers all ginners in India to produce the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.  A key feature is the use of blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification, addressing concerns about quality and origin. The initiative directly aims to improve the global market position of Indian cotton.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) serves as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative. The initiative operates on a self-regulatory model, meaning the industry itself takes responsibility for branding, traceability, and certification, enhancing the reliability and credibility of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand in international markets.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although Project PARI does aim to democratize art through public installations and transform urban landscapes into accessible galleries,  the first intervention is in Delhi, not Mumbai.  This detail is a crucial point of factual accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. Project PARI is indeed executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, and it involves the participation of over 150 visual artists from across India, showcasing a wide range of art forms including Thangka, Cheriyal, Bani Thani, and Alpana art. This reflects the diverse artistic heritage of India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 'Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi' initiative encompasses 50, not 25, tourist destinations across India.  This numerical inaccuracy makes the statement factually wrong.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objective of the 'Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi' initiative is to promote responsible tourism practices.  This includes engaging local communities in tourism activities and promoting sustainable tourism methods to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of tourism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajaraja Chola I is accurately credited with leading a major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This demonstrates the Chola Empire's significant naval power and its reach beyond the Indian subcontinent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra Chola I did conquer Sri Lanka, leading to its annexation as a Chola province, the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai is attributed to Rajaraja Chola I, not Rajendra Chola I. This shows the importance of differentiating between the achievements of different rulers within the same dynasty.


**7. With reference to Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance, the seasonal movement of livestock, is prevalent in the Himalayan region, with nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas moving their sheep and goats to subalpine and alpine pastures during summer and to adjoining plains during winter.  This practice also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat.
2.  In 2023, the transhumance traditions of the Himalayas and the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of transhumance in India accurately reflects the practice in the Himalayas and its extension to plains regions like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat.  The mention of specific nomadic tribes adds detail and accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2023, the Himalayan transhumance tradition was not.  The statement incorrectly combines two different examples of transhumance recognition.  It is important to note the specific locations and designations.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the three Indian literary works were indeed included in the register, the meeting was the 10th, not the 9th, meeting of MOWCAP.  Minor details like the meeting number are important for factual accuracy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IOA was indeed formed in 1927 with Sir Dorabji Tata as president and recognized by the IOC in the same year, but India is preparing to host the Olympic Games in 2036, not 2032, and aims to be among the top ten, not top five, sporting nations by 2047.  The years are crucial details.

Statement 2 is correct. The IOA's role in coordinating with National Sports Federations to send teams to international competitions is accurate.  However, the "One School-One Sport" policy is implemented by the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Education.  This highlights the importance of knowing the correct implementing ministry.

1. The Vijayanagara Empire, during the rule of Krishnadevaraya, expanded its territory to include the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers (the Raichur doab), subdued the rulers of Odisha, and inflicted significant defeats on the Sultan of Bijapur.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This highlights the ongoing challenges in understanding the civilization's writing system.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of religious practices and trade in the Indus Valley Civilization is accurate, based on archaeological findings.  The mention of specific deities and trade goods provides detailed information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nalanda was indeed a prominent Buddhist university,  Atisha Dipankara and Vasubandhu were associated with Vikramshila, not Nalanda.  The statement also mistakenly states that Nalanda was established during the Gupta period; it flourished during the Gupta period but wasn't established then.

Statement 2 is correct. Vikramshila's importance as a center of Buddhist learning during the Pala dynasty is accurate.  However, Odantipuri was the second-oldest, not the oldest, university in India. This again highlights the importance of precise chronological details.


**14. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Shree Jagannath Temple, dedicated to Lord Jagannath (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu), Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra, was built during the rule of Chodaganga Deva, the founder of the Ganga dynasty in the latter part of the 12th century A.D.
2. The temple's architecture is in the Kalinga style, a sub-style within the Nagara style, featuring a Vimana (Garbhagriha), Jagamohana (assembly hall), Natamandapa (dance hall), and Bhogamandapa (offering hall). The Ratna Bhandar, the sacred treasury of the temple, was reopened after 50 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The temple was built during the rule of Chodaganga Deva, but this was in the *first*, not the latter, part of the 12th century A.D.  The specific century is a critical detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the temple's architecture and its components is accurate.  The statement about the reopening of the Ratna Bhandar is also correct, but the number of years is slightly off.  It was reopened after 46 years, not 50.


**15. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Sahitya Akademi on writers, reserved for those considered 'immortals of literature'.  Ruskin Bond was awarded the fellowship in 2024.
2.  Some notable recipients of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship include Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, and Waheeda Rehman.  The fellowship is awarded to writers from all over the world.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship and its status as the highest literary honor is accurate.  However, the year mentioned for Ruskin Bond's award is incorrect.  The fellowship is awarded only to Indian writers.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the listed recipients are indeed past recipients of the award, the fellowship is not awarded to writers from all over the world; it is exclusively for Indian writers.  This shows the need for careful attention to the scope and criteria of the award.


**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on a report submitted by the Ministry of Culture, assessing the monument's national importance and traceability.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" and outlines the procedure for handling such cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The ASI's decision to delist monuments is indeed based on a report from the Ministry of Culture, which evaluates the national significance and traceability of the sites.  The process involves assessing whether the monument retains national importance, and the "untraceable" status is a key factor in the decision-making.  The delisting process is carried out according to Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* explicitly define "Missing Monuments." This term emerged from the usage by the CAG audit team in their reports. The Act focuses on declaring monuments of national importance or declaring that they have ceased to be of national importance, but it doesn't have a specific category for "missing" monuments.  The absence of a formal definition within the Act highlights a gap in addressing the issue of lost or untraceable historical sites.  The lack of a specific legal definition for "missing monuments" underscores the challenges in managing and preserving India's vast historical heritage.


**2. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases where the individual's service is deemed exceptionally significant.
2. The Padma Awards are announced annually on Independence Day and are categorized into Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While Padma Awards are typically not conferred posthumously, the government can make exceptions in highly deserving cases where the individual's contributions are deemed exceptionally significant. This highlights the flexibility in the award's application to recognize outstanding achievements even after the individual's passing.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Padma Awards are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  The categorization into Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri is accurate. The discrepancy regarding the announcement date reflects a common misunderstanding about the timing of the awards' announcement.


**3. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions to recognize outstanding contributions by retired central government employees.
2. The awards are based on Anubhav write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees and pensioners, detailing their experiences and insights gained during their service.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. This subtle difference in the awarding body reflects the specific focus on pensioner experiences and their contribution to governance.

Statement 2 is correct.  The awards are indeed based on Anubhav write-ups, which are essentially documented experiences shared by retiring central government employees and pensioners on the Anubhav Portal.  These write-ups provide valuable insights into governance and administrative processes.  The focus on Anubhav write-ups makes the awards unique in their utilization of experiential knowledge for administrative improvements.


**4. With reference to the Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950 and subsequently renamed in 1967.
2.  The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1952 (not 1950), it was renamed in 1967 along with its other classes. The incorrect year reflects a common error in recalling the establishment dates of gallantry awards.  The timeline of the award's institution and renaming is crucial for understanding its evolution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are wartime gallantry awards, not peacetime awards. The peacetime gallantry awards are the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This distinction between wartime and peacetime gallantry awards is important for understanding the context of these accolades.


**5. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards" and were administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals from their inception in 1954.
2. The awards are given in only two categories: Feature Films and Non-Feature Films.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards," the Directorate of Film Festivals took over administration in 1973, not from their inception. The change in administration highlights the evolution of the awards' organization and management over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema. The inclusion of a third category showcases the broader scope of the awards beyond just film production.


**6. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prix Versailles Award is given annually at UNESCO and is categorized into 24 World Titles focusing solely on architectural achievements in hotels and restaurants.
2. Projects submitted for consideration must demonstrate innovation, creativity, and ecological efficiency, but they are not evaluated on their reflection of local heritage or promotion of social interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prix Versailles Award is given annually at UNESCO and categorized into 24 World Titles, the categories extend beyond just hotels and restaurants. They include airports, campuses, passenger stations, sports facilities, museums, and many others. The wide range of categories demonstrates the award's broad scope in recognizing architectural excellence across diverse sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Projects are indeed evaluated on innovation, creativity, and ecological efficiency, but they are *also* assessed on their reflection of local heritage and promotion of social interaction and participation.  The holistic evaluation criteria highlight the award's emphasis on sustainable and socially responsible design.


**7. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University, founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, was primarily a center for learning in Vedic studies and remained active until the 13th century CE.
2. The university's library, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," housed over nine million books across nine floors and admitted students solely based on merit through rigorous entrance examinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nalanda University was indeed founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, its disciplines extended far beyond Vedic studies to encompass Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, Vajrayana Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy.  The broader range of subjects reflects the university's cosmopolitan nature and its significance as a center for interfaith learning.  Additionally, the university ceased to function in the 12th century CE, not the 13th century.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The description of the library ("Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth") and its vast collection is accurate, although the exact number of books is debated by scholars. The emphasis on merit-based admissions through rigorous examinations is also well-documented.  While the precise details might be subject to scholarly debate, the core aspects of the statement remain true.


**8. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vaikom Satyagraha, a non-violent movement lasting 604 days, focused on securing temple entry for all castes and was primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi.
2. The movement resulted in the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting access to lower-caste individuals into temples, and the establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent movement lasting approximately 604 days and focused on securing temple entry for all castes, it was not primarily led by Mahatma Gandhi.  Though he supported the movement, key figures like T.K. Madhavan, George Joseph, E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar), and others played leading roles.  The leadership of the movement was a collaborative effort rather than solely attributed to Gandhi.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha did lead to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting access to lower-caste individuals into temples, and the establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission. These outcomes reflect the movement's success in achieving significant social and political reforms.


**9. With reference to the Kakori Conspiracy Case, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kakori train action, carried out by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) on August 9, 1925, aimed to loot a British treasury train to fund revolutionary activities and involved key figures such as Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh.
2. The Lahore Conspiracy Case, which followed, saw the revolutionaries utilizing the courtroom to counter government propaganda and organize hunger strikes to improve prison conditions, ultimately leading to the execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kakori train robbery, executed by the HRA on August 9, 1925, aimed to secure funds for revolutionary activities.  The involvement of Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Roshan Singh is well-documented.  This event is a significant landmark in the Indian independence movement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Lahore Conspiracy Case, which followed, saw the revolutionaries using the courtroom as a platform to challenge the government's narrative and improve the conditions for political prisoners.  The hunger strike undertaken by Jatin Das and the subsequent executions of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru are key events in this case.  The strategic use of the legal system showcases the revolutionaries' political acumen.


**10. With reference to the Apartheid System in South Africa, consider the following statements:**

1. The Apartheid system, institutionalized in 1948, was a unique system of racial segregation in South Africa that subjected Black Africans, Coloureds, and Indians to various forms of discrimination and oppression, but not White Europeans.
2. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM), a successful transnational social movement, aimed to destabilize the apartheid regime through internal campaigns and external pressure for sanctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Apartheid system, formalized in 1948, was a uniquely brutal system of racial segregation in South Africa. It subjected Black Africans, Coloureds, and Indians to systematic discrimination and oppression, while White Europeans maintained privileged status.  The legal framework of Apartheid is well documented.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) was a remarkably successful transnational social movement that employed both internal resistance within South Africa and external pressure through international sanctions to dismantle the apartheid regime. The movement's strategies and impact are extensively studied.


**1. With reference to the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The statue depicts Lady Justice wearing a saree, symbolizing a departure from Western attire and a connection to Indian traditions.
2. The blindfold has been replaced with open eyes, signifying that justice is not blind but sees and understands societal complexities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court indeed showcases Lady Justice in a saree, representing a shift away from Western symbolism and an embrace of Indian cultural elements.  This symbolizes decoloniality and a move towards representing Indian traditions within the judicial system.  Furthermore, the removal of the blindfold and the inclusion of open eyes is a deliberate choice.  It signifies that the pursuit of justice is not blind but rather perceptive and aware of the nuances and complexities within society.  It represents a more active and informed understanding of justice, acknowledging societal differences and inequalities.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the symbolism embedded in the new statue.


**2. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The movement primarily focused on securing the right of entry for all castes into the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, a key objective achieved within the first year of the protest.
2.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) actively participated in the movement, but his dissatisfaction with the partial success led to his eventual departure from the Indian National Congress.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the Vaikom Satyagraha did indeed center around securing temple entry for lower-caste Hindus, the complete opening of all access routes to the temple was not achieved within the first year. The movement lasted significantly longer, and the full objective was only partially realized even after its conclusion. This makes statement 1 incorrect.  Periyar's involvement in the Vaikom Satyagraha is well-documented. His participation was crucial in mobilizing support and volunteers.  However, his disagreement with the limited success of the movement, particularly the continued restriction of access on certain paths, contributed to his later disassociation from the Indian National Congress.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this aspect of the historical event.


**3. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), led by Bhagat Singh, orchestrated the robbery to fund revolutionary activities against British rule.
2. The incident took place in 1925 near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, and resulted in the execution of several key figures involved.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the Kakori Train Action was indeed carried out by the HRA and aimed to secure funds for revolutionary activities, it's crucial to note that Bhagat Singh was not a leading figure in the planning or execution of this specific event.  He would become prominent later in the Indian independence movement.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The event occurred in 1925 near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, and resulted in the arrest and subsequent execution of several key HRA members, including Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.  Statement 2 accurately describes the location, timing, and consequences of the Kakori Train Action.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Padma Awards:**

1. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Republic Day, exclusively to Indian citizens.
2.  While normally not awarded posthumously, the government can make exceptions in highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954 and are announced annually on Republic Day. However, it's inaccurate to state that they are *exclusively* conferred to Indian citizens.  The awards have been given to notable non-Indians in recognition of their exceptional contributions.  This makes statement 1 incorrect. Statement 2 accurately reflects the established practice regarding posthumous awards.  While the general rule is against posthumous conferrals, the government retains the discretion to make exceptions in extraordinary circumstances where the contribution warrants recognition even after the individual's demise.


**5. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines the term "Missing Monuments" and outlines procedures for handling monuments that cannot be traced.
2. The Act empowers the Central Government to delist a monument if it is deemed to have ceased to be of national importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The AMASR Act, 1958, does not explicitly define or utilize the term "Missing Monuments."  The term emerged later in discussions surrounding the management and preservation of archaeological sites.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Act does, however, grant the Central Government the authority to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance.  This power is exercised based on assessments of historical significance and preservation needs.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this provision within the Act.


**6.  With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The modern Nalanda University was established in the 5th century CE, reviving the ancient institution's focus on Buddhist studies.
2.  The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was made at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the ancient Nalanda University was indeed founded in the 5th century CE, the modern Nalanda University is a separate entity established much later.  Its curriculum is broader than just Buddhist studies, encompassing a wide range of disciplines.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The decision to establish the modern Nalanda University as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue was indeed taken at the 2nd East Asia Summit held in the Philippines in 2007.  This decision laid the groundwork for the university's subsequent establishment under the Nalanda University Act, 2010.  Statement 2 correctly reflects this historical fact.


**7. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is conferred annually on Republic Day, exclusively to individuals who have made exceptional contributions to the arts.
2.  The award does not carry any monetary grant, and recipients cannot use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award in India, but it's not exclusively given for contributions to the arts.  It recognizes exceptional achievements across various fields, including science, literature, social work, and public service.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bharat Ratna award does not include any monetary component.  Furthermore, according to Article 18(1) of the Constitution, recipients are not permitted to use the title "Bharat Ratna" as a prefix or suffix to their name.  Statement 2 accurately reflects these aspects of the award.


**8. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The empire's zenith was attained during the rule of the Sangama Dynasty, known for its extensive territorial conquests and flourishing arts.
2. The Amara-Nayakas were appointed military commanders who governed assigned territories, collecting taxes and retaining a portion for their expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the Sangama Dynasty was instrumental in establishing the Vijayanagara Empire, its zenith is generally associated with the subsequent Tuluva Dynasty, particularly under Krishnadevaraya's reign.  This makes statement 1 incorrect. The Amara-Nayaka system was a crucial part of the Vijayanagara Empire's administrative structure.  These military commanders were granted territories to govern, collecting taxes and retaining a share of the revenue for their personal upkeep, the maintenance of their troops and infrastructure, and contributions to temples and irrigation projects.  Statement 2 accurately describes the function and role of the Amara-Nayakas.


**9. Consider the following statements about Dayanand Saraswati:**

1. He advocated for a complete overhaul of the education system, emphasizing Vedic education for all castes while rejecting the caste system as hereditary.
2. He initiated the Shuddhi movement to bring back those who had converted to Islam or Christianity, and he also championed the cause of women's education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Dayanand Saraswati's reformist ideas included a significant critique of the existing education system and a strong advocacy for Vedic education to be accessible to all castes.  He also challenged the hereditary nature of the caste system, arguing for a more meritocratic approach.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  The Shuddhi movement, initiated by Dayanand Saraswati, aimed to bring back those who had converted to other religions.  He also actively advocated for women's education, opposing child marriage and other discriminatory practices.  Statement 2 also accurately reflects his contributions.


**10. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative focuses on training women and youth exclusively to enhance tourist experiences by creating unique tourism products.
2. The primary aim is to elevate the overall tourist experience by having them interact with local people who act as ambassadors and storytellers for their destination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative does indeed emphasize training women and youth, it's not exclusively limited to them. The training is open to a wider range of individuals involved in tourism-related services. This makes statement 1 incorrect.  The core objective of the initiative is to enhance the tourist experience by connecting visitors with local people who can act as knowledgeable guides and representatives of their destinations, showcasing the cultural richness and unique experiences of Incredible India. Statement 2 correctly identifies the central aim of the initiative.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:**

1. The AMASR Act empowers the Central Government to delist ancient monuments deemed no longer of national importance, allowing for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area.
2.  The Act mandates the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct exhaustive surveys every five years to assess the condition and national importance of all protected monuments under its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed empowers the Central Government to delist monuments that cease to be of national importance.  This delisting removes the monument from ASI protection, allowing for development activities in the area.  The process involves a determination of national significance, and the Act provides the legal basis for such a decision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act does not mandate regular five-yearly surveys by the ASI to assess the condition and national importance of all protected monuments. While the ASI regularly monitors and maintains protected sites, there is no specific legal requirement for a periodic, comprehensive reassessment of every monument's national significance at a fixed interval.  The assessment of a monument's importance is a more ad-hoc process, triggered by various factors including concerns about the condition of the monument or requests for delisting.  The frequency and scope of these assessments are not explicitly defined in the Act. The lack of a mandated, regular, five-yearly survey is a crucial point of distinction, making statement 2 incorrect.



**2. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University was initially established as a Buddhist monastery in the 5th century CE, later evolving into a renowned center of learning that attracted students from across Asia.
2. The modern Nalanda University, inaugurated in Rajgir, Bihar, adheres to a strict merit-based admission policy, mirroring the historical institution's practices, and prioritizes inter-civilisational dialogue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Historical accounts confirm that Nalanda University originated as a Buddhist monastery in the 5th century CE, gradually developing into a prestigious center of learning that attracted scholars and students from diverse regions of Asia.  The statement accurately captures the evolution of Nalanda from a monastic setting to a major educational institution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the modern Nalanda University aims to foster inter-civilisational dialogue, the description of its admission policy as strictly merit-based and mirroring historical practices is an oversimplification. The modern university's admission procedures and criteria may be merit-based to some extent, but they are unlikely to be an exact replica of the ancient university's system. The historical admission process involved rigorous examinations conducted by trained gatekeepers, a detail which is not necessarily replicated in the modern university's admission process. The statement presents an idealized and potentially inaccurate representation of the modern university's admissions, making it incorrect.


**3. With reference to the National Monuments Authority (NMA), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMA is empowered to grant permissions for construction activities within prohibited and regulated areas near centrally protected monuments, provided such constructions align with conservation guidelines and do not compromise the integrity of the monuments.
2. The NMA is responsible for the complete financial management and budgetary allocation for all centrally protected monuments in India, ensuring appropriate funding for their preservation and maintenance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NMA's functions include granting permissions for construction near centrally protected monuments. However, these permissions are subject to strict conditions ensuring the preservation of the monuments.  The NMA's role is to balance development needs with the imperative of protecting these important historical sites.  The statement accurately reflects this aspect of the NMA's authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NMA's responsibilities do not extend to the complete financial management and budgetary allocation for all centrally protected monuments. While the NMA plays a vital role in the protection and preservation of these monuments, the financial management aspects are distributed across various government bodies and agencies. The NMA focuses primarily on regulatory and conservation aspects, not comprehensive financial control over the entire budget allocated to monument maintenance. The statement misrepresents the scope of the NMA's financial authority, making it incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented annually by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, recognizing lifetime achievements in the Indian film industry.
2.  The award was instituted in 1969 to commemorate the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, widely regarded as the father of Indian cinema, and the recipient receives a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion and a cash prize.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dadasaheb Phalke Award does recognize lifetime achievements in the Indian film industry, it is presented annually by the *Directorate of Film Festivals*, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. This subtle difference is crucial and highlights the importance of precise factual knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The award was indeed instituted in 1969 to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, acknowledging his pivotal role in the early development of Indian cinema.  The description of the award's components – the Golden Lotus medallion and a cash prize – is also accurate. The statement provides a factual and accurate account of the award's origins and presentation.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Padma Awards:**

1. The Padma Awards, instituted in 1954, are conferred annually on Republic Day and are among India's highest civilian honors.  They are awarded posthumously only in exceptional circumstances.
2. The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for exceptional and distinguished service, while the Padma Shri is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, with the Padma Bhushan ranking between the two.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Republic Day. While generally not conferred posthumously, the statement correctly notes that exceptions are made in highly deserving cases. This nuance makes the statement accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly describes the hierarchy of the Padma Awards. The Padma Vibhushan is the highest of the three awards, followed by the Padma Bhushan, and then the Padma Shri. The statement reverses the order of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, making it factually inaccurate.  The correct order is crucial for understanding the relative significance of these awards.


**1. With reference to the Chola dynasty's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, marking a high point of their naval power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja Chola I did consolidate Chola power along the Coromandel Coast, his naval ambitions extended far beyond the Bay of Bengal.  His victories at Kandalursalai against the Chera navy and his annexation of northern Sri Lanka demonstrate a clear expansionist naval policy reaching beyond regional dominance.  The statement minimizes the scope of his naval activities.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's military campaigns represent a pinnacle of Chola naval power. His conquest of the Sailendra Empire, encompassing parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcases the reach and effectiveness of his navy. This expedition significantly expanded Chola influence and trade routes in Southeast Asia, leaving a lasting impact on the region's political and cultural landscape.  The statement accurately reflects this significant historical event.  The extent of Chola maritime power during this period is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynasty's influence and the broader history of maritime trade in the Indian Ocean.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative, primarily focused on European transhumance practices, has limited engagement with transhumance traditions in other parts of the world.
2.  Transhumance in India, characterized by the seasonal migration of nomadic pastoralist communities like the Gujars and Bakarwals, is a significant example of this practice, particularly in the Himalayan regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the initiative acknowledges and highlights European transhumance traditions (as evidenced by the inclusion of  "Transhumance in 10 European States" and "Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland" on the Intangible Cultural Heritages list), it's misleading to suggest a *limited* engagement with other regions. The very existence of the initiative, supported by Azerbaijan and led by ICOMOS, implies a broader global interest in preserving and promoting transhumance practices worldwide.  The statement presents an incomplete and potentially biased view of the initiative's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The description accurately depicts the presence and significance of transhumance in India's Himalayan and plains regions.  The mention of specific nomadic tribes (Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas) and their seasonal movements between pastures and plains provides concrete evidence of this practice.  This statement effectively illustrates a key aspect of transhumance across diverse geographical contexts within India.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The inclusion of manuscripts of Indian literary works like the *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* in the register signifies India's rich literary heritage and its global recognition.
2. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) held in Beijing, China, finalized the inclusion of these manuscripts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The inclusion of these significant Indian literary works in the UNESCO MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register underscores the importance of preserving and promoting India's cultural heritage on a global platform.  These texts represent a significant contribution to world literature and their inclusion is a testament to their enduring value.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the statement correctly identifies the 10th MOWCAP meeting as the point at which the decision was made, the location is incorrect. The meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This detail, while seemingly minor, demonstrates a lack of precise factual knowledge, which is crucial in UPSC-style questions. The error in the location highlights the importance of accuracy in recalling specific details related to international organizations and their activities.


**4. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization's trade and commerce, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus civilization's extensive trade network was primarily facilitated by land routes, with limited evidence suggesting maritime connections.
2. Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as Meluha, indicating established trade relations and the existence of intermediary trading stations like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indus Valley Civilization had a robust maritime trade network, as evidenced by the discovery of dockyards like the one at Lothal.  The statement underestimates the significance of maritime trade in the Indus civilization's economic and cultural development.  The presence of standardized weights and measures further supports the existence of a sophisticated and extensive trade network, both inland and overseas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mesopotamian references to Meluha, along with the identification of intermediary trading stations like Dilmun and Makan, provide strong evidence of established trade links between the Indus Valley Civilization and Mesopotamia. These references help to contextualize the Indus civilization within a wider network of ancient civilizations and trade routes.  The statement correctly points to crucial archaeological and textual evidence supporting the existence of such trade relationships.


**5. With reference to the Lothal archaeological site and the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC), consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal's significance lies primarily in its well-preserved urban planning, showcasing advanced urban development in the Indus Valley Civilization, but lacking evidence of maritime activities.
2. The NMHC, being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, aims to showcase India's rich maritime heritage, with Lothal serving as a key site due to its ancient man-made dry dock.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lothal does exhibit advanced urban planning typical of the Indus Valley Civilization, its importance also rests significantly on its maritime connections. The discovery of a man-made dry dock at Lothal provides strong evidence of sophisticated shipbuilding and maritime trade during the Indus Valley Civilization. The statement incorrectly downplays Lothal's maritime aspects.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMHC project, undertaken under the Sagarmala Programme, aims to highlight India's extensive maritime history.  Lothal's presence as a key site within this project is directly linked to the discovery of the ancient dry dock, which showcases early maritime technology and trade practices.  The statement accurately describes the NMHC's objective and Lothal's crucial role in it.


**6. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's architectural style is a unique blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles, reflecting a synthesis of South and North Indian architectural traditions.
2. The Vajrasana, a polished sandstone platform within the temple complex, marks the spot where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Mahabodhi Temple exhibits elements of classical Indian temple architecture, it is not a direct blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles. Its unique design, described as narrow like a Nagara temple but rising without the characteristic curvature of a Dravidian temple, distinguishes it from other architectural styles.  The statement misrepresents the temple's distinct architectural features.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vajrasana is indeed a significant feature of the Mahabodhi Temple complex, marking the place where Buddha is traditionally believed to have attained enlightenment.  Emperor Ashoka is credited with installing this platform, underscoring its historical and religious importance.  The statement accurately describes the Vajrasana's location and significance within the Buddhist tradition.


**7. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement establishing the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor allows for visa-free travel for all Sikh pilgrims from India to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, regardless of their nationality.
2.  The agreement ensures reciprocal access, allowing Pakistani Sikhs visa-free travel to Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The agreement facilitates visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.  The agreement specifically mentions this provision, making it a key feature of the corridor's functionality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement does *not* provide reciprocal visa-free access for Pakistani Sikhs to Gurdwara Dera Baba Nanak in India.  Pakistani Sikhs still require an Indian visa to visit India, highlighting the asymmetry in the agreement's provisions.  The statement misrepresents a crucial aspect of the agreement's limitations.


**8. With reference to the archaeological discoveries in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ooragutta site primarily reveals Neolithic-era settlements, characterized by the use of polished stone tools and early agricultural practices.
2. The newly discovered rock art sites at Damaratogu showcase depictions of both humans and animals, often engaging in hunting or ceremonial activities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Ooragutta is identified as an Iron Age megalithic site, not a Neolithic site.  The statement incorrectly assigns the site to a different period in prehistory, demonstrating a lack of precision regarding archaeological dating.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rock art site at Devarlabanda Mula, specifically mentioned in the text, only depicts animals and lacks human figures or depictions of weapons. The statement attributes a characteristic (depictions of humans and animals engaged in activities) to the rock art that is not present in at least one of the mentioned sites.  The statement fails to accurately reflect the specific characteristics of the discovered rock art.


**9. With reference to the Kalinga dynasty and its cultural heritage, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, led by Emperor Ashoka, resulted in the complete destruction of the Kalinga kingdom and the subsequent decline of its cultural influence.
2. Kharavela, a prominent ruler of the Kalinga dynasty, is known for his patronage of Jainism, as evidenced by the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves and the Hathigumpha inscription.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War was a significant event, leading to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, it did not result in the complete destruction of the Kalinga kingdom or its immediate cultural decline. The Kalinga dynasty continued to exist, and its cultural influence persisted, even if under Mauryan rule. The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate portrayal of the historical impact of the Kalinga War.

Statement 2 is correct.  Kharavela's reign is indeed associated with the patronage of Jainism. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves, along with the Hathigumpha inscription, provide significant evidence of this patronage. The inscription provides details about his military campaigns and other aspects of his rule. The statement correctly highlights a key aspect of Kharavela's reign and its cultural significance.


**10. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. Located near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, the Bavikonda Monastery is a well-preserved example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture dating back to the 1st century CE.
2. The name "Bavikonda," meaning "hill of wells," reflects the presence of ancient water storage systems at the site, crucial for supporting monastic life.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bavikonda Monastery is associated with Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana Buddhism. The statement incorrectly identifies the dominant Buddhist sect associated with the monastery.  Further, the dating is also slightly inaccurate; it dates back to the 3rd century BCE, not the 1st century CE.

Statement 2 is correct. The name "Bavikonda" accurately reflects the historical presence of wells at the site, essential for water storage and the sustenance of monastic communities in the region. This detail provides valuable insight into the practical aspects of monastic life at Bavikonda. The statement correctly explains the origin and significance of the site's name.


**11. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, primarily depict naturalistic representations of human figures engaged in various activities.
2. Mesolithic period rock paintings predominantly feature geometric patterns and abstract designs, with limited depictions of animals or human figures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Upper Paleolithic paintings exist, they primarily feature animal figures (bison, elephants, tigers, etc.) and linear representations of human figures, not detailed naturalistic depictions of human activities.  The statement misrepresents the style and subject matter of Upper Paleolithic rock art.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mesolithic period paintings are characterized by the predominance of human scenes, including hunting, community dances, and naturalistic depictions of animals, contrasting with the statement's description of geometric and abstract designs.  The statement inaccurately describes the artistic style and subject matter of Mesolithic rock paintings.


**12. With reference to the  Neolithic age rock carvings discovered in Goa's Mauxi village, consider the following statements:**

1. The carvings are etched onto granite rock formations along the banks of the Zuari River.
2. The carvings primarily depict geometric patterns and abstract symbols, with limited depictions of animals or human figures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The carvings are found etched into *meta basalt* rock along the dry riverbed of the *Zarme* River, not granite along the Zuari River.  The statement contains errors regarding both the type of rock and the river location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The carvings prominently feature animals such as zebus, bulls, and antelopes, alongside footprints and cupules.  The statement incorrectly describes the subject matter of the carvings, emphasizing geometric patterns which are not the primary focus of these carvings.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victory at Kandalursalai significantly weakened the Pandya navy, paving the way for Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal.
2.  Rajendra I's conquest extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the empire's far-reaching naval power and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja I's significant naval victory at Kandalursalai was against the Chera navy, not the Pandya navy.  The Pandyas were also a significant maritime power in the region, and while the Cholas did contend with them, Kandalursalai specifically involved the Cheras.  The Chola naval dominance in the Bay of Bengal resulted from a series of victories against various opponents, including the Pandyas, but not solely from this one battle.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I significantly expanded the Chola empire's naval reach. His conquests included regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrating the empire's impressive maritime capabilities and its projection of power far beyond the Indian subcontinent. This expansion is well-documented and forms a crucial part of understanding the Chola empire's geopolitical influence. The scale of these expeditions and the success achieved solidified the Chola's status as a major naval power in the region.


**2. With reference to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and its initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1.  ICOMOS, based in Paris, France, is a leading international organization dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage sites and traditions.
2.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS, focuses exclusively on the preservation of traditional livestock herding practices in the European Alps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ICOMOS is indeed a leading international organization dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage, its headquarters are not located in Paris.  The text does not specify the location of ICOMOS headquarters, but this is a common misconception. It is important to be aware of the actual location of such major international organizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while focusing on transhumance, does not limit its scope exclusively to the European Alps. The initiative encompasses a broader geographical area, including regions where this traditional practice is prevalent. The text explicitly mentions that transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas and other parts of India.  The inclusion of examples outside of Europe demonstrates the initiative's broader reach and concern for diverse transhumance traditions worldwide.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes only manuscripts written in Sanskrit and Pali, reflecting the region's ancient literary traditions.
2. The MOW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains a single, unified register encompassing all documented heritage worldwide.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts from various languages and literary traditions, not just Sanskrit and Pali. The inclusion of works like *Ramcharitmanas* (written in Awadhi) and *Panchatantra* (written in Sanskrit) demonstrates the register's diversity and its commitment to preserving a wider range of literary heritage from the Asia-Pacific region.  Limiting the register to only two languages would be a significant misrepresentation of the rich linguistic diversity of the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MOW Programme maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National. This tiered structure allows for more focused and efficient management of the vast documentary heritage across the globe.  A single, unified register would be unwieldy and less effective in preserving and promoting documentary heritage.


**4.  With reference to the Flag Code of India, 2002, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2022 amendment to the Flag Code of India permits the display of the National Flag only on designated national holidays and special occasions.
2. The Flag Code mandates that the Indian National Flag must be made exclusively from hand-spun and hand-woven cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 2022 amendment to the Flag Code of India actually broadened the permissible display of the National Flag. It allows for the display of the National Flag on all days and nights, not just on specified occasions. This amendment reflects a more inclusive approach to national pride and allows individuals and organizations greater freedom to display the flag.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment to the Flag Code of India updated the materials allowed for the National Flag. While hand-spun and hand-woven cotton is permitted,  the amendment also allows for machine-made flags and other materials like polyester, wool, silk, and Ichadi bunting. This amendment reflects a pragmatic approach, acknowledging the need for both traditional methods and modern manufacturing techniques in producing the National Flag.


**5. With reference to the National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1. National Handloom Day is celebrated annually on August 7th to commemorate the contribution of handloom weavers to India's cultural heritage and economy.
2. The celebration of National Handloom Day is primarily focused on promoting the use of handloom products within India and restricting their export to preserve domestic markets.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. National Handloom Day is indeed celebrated annually on August 7th to recognize the significant role of handloom weavers in India's rich cultural tapestry and economic landscape.  The date is chosen to honor the contributions of this vital sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The celebration of National Handloom Day aims to promote handloom products both domestically and internationally. The focus is on showcasing India's handloom heritage and supporting the livelihoods of handloom weavers, not on restricting exports.  Expanding markets through exports is a key component of supporting the handloom industry's growth and sustainability.


**6. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime trade, consider the following statements:**

1. Nagapattinam served as a major port city for the Chola Empire, facilitating extensive trade with Southeast Asia and other regions, fostering cultural exchange.
2. The Chola Empire’s dominance of the Bay of Bengal was primarily achieved through diplomatic negotiations and trade agreements, rather than significant naval power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nagapattinam was a crucial port city for the Chola Empire, acting as a major hub for maritime trade with Southeast Asia and beyond. Its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure facilitated extensive trade and cultural exchange, contributing significantly to the empire's prosperity and influence. The historical records confirm Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading center.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Chola Empire undoubtedly engaged in diplomatic relations and trade agreements, its control over the Bay of Bengal was largely secured through its powerful navy.  The Chola rulers, like Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, actively pursued aggressive military policies and engaged in significant naval expeditions, establishing their dominance in the region through force.


**7. With reference to the Summer Solstice, consider the following statements:**

1. On the Summer Solstice, the Southern Hemisphere experiences its longest day and shortest night.
2.  The Summer Solstice occurs on June 21st in the Northern Hemisphere, when the sun's rays fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Summer Solstice is the day with the longest period of daylight in the year for one hemisphere and the shortest day of the year for the opposite hemisphere. Because the Earth is tilted on its axis, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away.  Therefore, the Southern Hemisphere experiences its shortest day and longest night on the Northern Hemisphere's Summer Solstice.

Statement 2 is correct. The Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere does indeed occur around June 21st, when the sun's rays are directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. This is a key astronomical event that marks the beginning of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.  The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the sun's apparent position to reach its highest point in the sky during this time.


**8. With reference to the  UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN), consider the following statements:**

1. Srinagar's designation as a World Craft City by the World Crafts Council International (WCCI) predates its inclusion in the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN).
2.  The UCCN recognizes cities that have demonstrated exceptional commitment to fostering creativity and innovation in specific creative fields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that Srinagar's recognition as a World Craft City came *three years after* its designation as part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) for crafts and folk arts in 2021. Therefore, the UCCN designation preceded the World Craft City recognition.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) specifically aims to identify and promote cities that have made a strong commitment to developing and utilizing creativity and innovation in various creative fields.  This network fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among cities that are committed to the creative economy.  The selection criteria for UCCN membership are rigorous, focusing on cities with demonstrable achievements in creative fields.


**9. With reference to the  Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

2.  The award is presented annually by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award was indeed instituted in 1969 to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, the "father of Indian cinema."  This timing reflects the significance of Phalke's contributions to the development of Indian cinema and the importance of recognizing his legacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  While both entities are involved in promoting Indian cinema, the award's presentation falls under the purview of the Directorate of Film Festivals.  It is crucial to understand the precise organizational structure and responsibilities involved in the awarding of such prestigious honors.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup was jointly hosted by the USA and the West Indies, not Australia. The selection of these two countries as hosts reflects the growing global popularity of cricket and the desire to expand the tournament's reach to new audiences.

Statement 2 is correct. India did indeed win the 2024 T20 Cricket World Cup, defeating South Africa in the final match.  This victory marks India's second triumph in the T20 World Cup, following their previous win in 2007.  This win is a significant achievement in the world of cricket and reflects India's strong performance in the tournament.

2. Rajendra I's most significant naval expedition was the conquest of the Sailendra Empire, encompassing the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval prowess.  Statement 1 correctly identifies Rajaraja I's military achievements, including his naval victories against the Cheras and his expansionist campaigns into Sri Lanka and the Maldives. These campaigns demonstrated the Chola navy's strength and reach. Statement 2 accurately describes Rajendra I's significant naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion solidified Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal, justifying the description of the Bay of Bengal as a "Chola lake" reflecting their control over maritime trade and power projection in the region.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the historical accuracy of both statements concerning the significant naval expeditions and conquests under both Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.


**2. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IVC's trade network extended to Mesopotamia, with evidence suggesting the export of grains, jewelry, and pottery, and the import of thin copper and precious stones.  The civilization used standardized weights and measures facilitating trade.
2.  Religious practices in the IVC included the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), depicted in seals, and a female deity, the Mother Goddess, represented in terracotta figurines;  the civilization lacked temples and practiced nature worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization. Statement 1 correctly highlights the extensive trade network of the IVC, which reached Mesopotamia. Archaeological evidence supports the exchange of goods, including the exports mentioned and the imports of materials like copper and precious stones. The use of standardized weights and measures further indicates a sophisticated trading system. Statement 2 correctly describes the religious practices of the IVC, noting the prominent male deity Pasupati and the Mother Goddess. The absence of identifiable temples suggests a different approach to religious practices compared to later civilizations, while the evidence of nature worship is also well-documented. The other options are incorrect as they fail to appreciate the comprehensive nature of both statements which accurately reflect the trade and religious aspects of the IVC.


**3. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda's admission was strictly merit-based, with exams conducted by trained gatekeepers, and its library, "Dharma Gunj," housed over nine million books across nine floors.  The university was patronized by King Harshavardhana and the Pala rulers.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval expansion under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval power, culminating in conquests that included the Maldives and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka.  These actions demonstrated the reach and effectiveness of the Chola navy.  Rajendra I, Rajaraja's successor, continued this aggressive naval policy.  His campaigns resulted in the complete subjugation of Sri Lanka, transforming it into a Chola province.  Furthermore, his expedition against the Sailendra Empire showcased the extent of Chola maritime dominance, reaching across the Bay of Bengal to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. Statement 1 correctly identifies transhumance as a prevalent practice in the Himalayas, involving specific nomadic tribes who migrate with their herds between highland pastures in summer and lowland areas in winter. However, it is crucial to note that transhumance is not limited to the Himalayas; it's also practiced in other parts of India.  Statement 2 accurately reflects UNESCO's recognition of transhumance traditions in Europe and Switzerland as Intangible Cultural Heritages, highlighting the global significance of this practice. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don’t fully capture the scope and recognition of transhumance.

(a) 1 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register has indeed included several Indian literary works, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of India.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.  The International Register is a significant part of the program, but the existence of regional and national registers demonstrates a broader approach to preserving documentary heritage.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the structure and scope of the MOW Programme.


**4. With reference to the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 3 of the Act allows for the export of antiquities outside India under specific circumstances, provided the necessary permits are obtained.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, primarily *prohibits* the export of antiquities without permission, aiming to protect India's cultural heritage.  While there might be exceptions under specific circumstances, the general principle is one of restriction, not permission.  Statement 2 is also inaccurate. While the ASI plays a crucial role in coordination and recovery, it’s not the *sole* entity responsible; other agencies and departments may be involved depending on the specific circumstances of the case.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the provisions of the Act.

1. The Padma Awards, instituted in 1954, are exclusively awarded posthumously to individuals who have made exceptional contributions to various fields.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While highly deserving cases might receive posthumous awards, the Padma Awards are not *exclusively* given posthumously.  The general practice is to present them to living recipients. Statement 2 is correct. The Padma Vibhushan is indeed the highest award in the Padma series, followed by the Padma Bhushan and then the Padma Shri.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of Statement 1.


**6. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are not presented by the Ministry of Culture; they are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare. Statement 2 accurately describes the basis of the Anubhav Awards – the sharing of experiences by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal.  This highlights the scheme's focus on leveraging the experience of retiring employees to improve governance. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy of Statement 1.

1. The Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are awarded exclusively during wartime.
2.  The Ashoka Chakra was instituted in 1950, with three classes (I, II, and III) later renamed in 1967 as Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are primarily wartime awards, the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are awarded for peacetime gallantry. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The wartime gallantry awards (Param Vir Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950. The Ashoka Chakra (in three classes) was instituted in 1952 and renamed in 1967.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.

1. The National Film Awards, established in 1954, were initially known as the "State Awards" and primarily focused on recognizing feature films.
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the National Film Awards since 1973, expanding the award categories to include non-feature films and best writing in cinema.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the awards were initially called "State Awards," but it's inaccurate to say they *primarily* focused on feature films, as they also included other categories initially. Statement 2 is correct; the Directorate of Film Festivals has indeed administered the awards since 1973, and the categories have expanded over time.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because Statement 1 is only partially correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prix Versailles Award recognizes architectural projects, it encompasses numerous categories beyond just Museums and Memorials, including Airports, Campuses, Hotels, and many more. Statement 2 is correct. The award's criteria explicitly emphasize innovation, cultural sensitivity, environmental responsibility, and social impact.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because Statement 1 is inaccurate.


**10. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

His campaigns showcased a significant reach into the Bay of Bengal, and laid the groundwork for Rajendra I's later expeditions.

This significantly extended Chola influence into Southeast Asia, profoundly impacting trade routes and the regional political landscape.  The "Chola Lake" – the Bay of Bengal under Chola control – facilitated trade with Southeast Asian nations, underscoring the strategic importance of these conquests.  The statement accurately reflects this significant expansion and its impact on trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the renaming seeks to move away from the colonial legacy, the connection is not to the Vijayanagara Empire. The name "Sri Vijaya Puram" commemorates Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's unfurling of the Indian flag in the islands, symbolizing the Indian freedom struggle.  The islands' historical significance as a naval base during the Chola Empire is also a factor.

Statement 2 is correct. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram directly reflects the dual historical importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Firstly, it acknowledges the strategic role the islands played during the Chola Empire as a naval base, showcasing their historical significance within India's maritime past. Secondly, and more prominently, it commemorates the islands' role in the Indian independence movement, particularly Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's visit and the unfurling of the Indian flag, marking a crucial moment in the fight for freedom.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

The G20 endorsement of the initiative as an "outcome document" signifies its international recognition and potential for broader global collaboration in preserving cultural heritage.  It is not limited to a single nation's efforts.

Statement 2 is correct. The G20's endorsement of a global coalition to combat illicit trafficking directly supports and strengthens existing national-level initiatives, such as Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972. This Act already plays a crucial role in preventing the illegal export of antiquities from India; the global coalition would enhance international cooperation and enforcement, making the fight against illicit trafficking more effective. The statement accurately reflects this complementary relationship between international and national efforts.

**17. With reference to the Sangam period, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangam period is primarily associated with the development of Sanskrit literature and its influence on the cultural landscape of ancient India.
2.  The Sangam period refers to assemblies of poets and scholars in ancient Tamil Nadu, featuring notable female poets like Avvaiyar, and social classifications were known to Sangam poets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sangam period is not primarily associated with Sanskrit literature.  It is specifically linked to the Tamil language and its rich literary tradition. The Sangam literature, written in Tamil, provides valuable insights into the social, cultural, and political aspects of ancient Tamil Nadu. Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately defines the Sangam period as a time of assemblies of poets and scholars in ancient Tamil Nadu. It also correctly mentions notable female poets like Avvaiyar and notes that the social classification system of Varna was known to the Sangam poets.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the characteristics of the Sangam period.



**1. With reference to megalithic burial practices in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalith, are characterized by their fully subterranean construction.
2.  Megalithic sites exclusively served as burial grounds, with no evidence of other activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean*, meaning partially underground, not fully subterranean.  The description emphasizes their partially buried nature, a key characteristic distinguishing them from other types of megalithic structures.  A complete underground construction would be inconsistent with the archaeological findings and descriptions of dolmenoid cists.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While megaliths are primarily associated with burial practices, archaeological evidence suggests that some sites also served other functions, potentially indicating broader societal activities beyond solely funerary rituals.  The text itself mentions three basic types of megaliths, indicating a diversity of purposes that extends beyond burial.  The simplistic view presented in Statement 2 ignores the complexity of megalithic cultures and their land use.  A comprehensive understanding necessitates recognizing the multifaceted roles these sites likely played within their respective communities.


**2. With reference to the Phanigiri archaeological site in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Phanigiri site primarily reveals evidence of early Vedic culture, predating the Buddhist period.
2.  Excavations at Phanigiri have unearthed only Buddhist artifacts, with no evidence of other religious or cultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that Phanigiri is a *Buddhist* site, containing structures like a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, and viharas. This directly contradicts the claim of a primarily Vedic origin.  The mention of Ikshvaku period coins further confirms its association with a later historical period than the early Vedic era.  The timeframe suggested in Statement 1 is incompatible with the established archaeological understanding of the site.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the site is predominantly Buddhist, the discovery of Brahmi inscriptions from both the Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods suggests a broader cultural and historical context than solely Buddhist influences. The coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects also points to a complex religious landscape.  The assertion of exclusively Buddhist artifacts is an oversimplification of the archaeological findings at Phanigiri. The presence of inscriptions and the diverse architectural elements demonstrate a more nuanced and layered history.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bavikonda Monastery is a significant example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture, showcasing elaborate stupas and monasteries.
2.  The name "Bavikonda," meaning "hill of wells," reflects the site's strategic location as a major water source during ancient times.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifically mentions that Bavikonda is a *Theravada* (Hinayana) Buddhist complex. This contradicts the statement's assertion of Mahayana architecture. The architectural features listed – a Mahastupa, Acharya Vihara, Chaitya Griha, etc. – are consistent with Theravada Buddhism, not exclusively Mahayana.  Confusing the two major branches of Buddhism is a common error, hence the inclusion of this distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The explanation of the name "Bavikonda" as "hill of wells" and its historical function as a rainwater storage area is accurately reflected in the provided text.  This directly links the name's etymology to the site's practical function and its environment.  The geographical context and the name's origin are historically verifiable facts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the CWG 2026 edition will feature *only 10 sports*, a reduction from the previous edition.  This directly contradicts the assertion of significant expansion.  The reduction in the number of sports is a significant change, and understanding this detail is crucial for accurate assessment.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights that six disciplines, which contributed significantly to India's medal tally in 2022 (30 out of 61 medals), have been removed from the 2026 Games. This directly supports the statement, emphasizing the impact of these exclusions on India's potential performance in the upcoming event.  The numbers presented in the text provide concrete evidence to support the statement's accuracy.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the 45th Chess Olympiad was held in Budapest, Hungary.  The statement mistakenly attributes the location to Chennai, which hosted the *44th* Olympiad.  This is a detail-oriented point, requiring precise recall of the event's location.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions that the Indian contingent won gold medals in both the open and women's categories at the 45th Chess Olympiad.  This is a straightforward factual statement, easily verifiable from the given information.  The success of the Indian team is prominently highlighted, making this a clear and unambiguous point.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there is *no term* called "Missing Monuments" in the AMASR Act. The term's usage is attributed to the CAG Audit team, highlighting the difference between official legal terminology and informal usage.  This point requires an understanding of the nuances of legal language and its interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly explains that the Act empowers the Central Government to declare that a monument has ceased to be of national importance, effectively allowing for its delisting.

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalith, are characterized by their fully subterranean construction.
2.  The three primary categories of megaliths include chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and structures unrelated to burials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as *semi-subterranean* chamber tombs, meaning they are partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  The partially buried nature of these structures is a key characteristic differentiating them from other types of megalithic burial sites.  A fully subterranean structure would be entirely below ground level.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text accurately identifies the three main classifications of megalithic structures: chamber tombs (containing burial chambers), unchambered tombs (simple burial pits or mounds), and megaliths without any apparent funerary purpose. This categorization reflects the diversity of function and design found within megalithic architecture across various regions and time periods in India.  The classification helps archaeologists understand the range of cultural practices and beliefs associated with these ancient monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Phanigiri is a Buddhist site, the excavations have unearthed evidence suggesting the co-existence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects. The presence of architectural features and iconography associated with both traditions indicates a complex religious landscape, not a singular adherence to Mahayana Buddhism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Phanigiri is located approximately 110 kilometers from Hyderabad, not Vijayawada.  These are two distinct cities in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh respectively, highlighting the importance of precise geographical location in archaeological studies.  Confusing the two cities demonstrates a lack of attention to detail.


**3. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bavikonda Monastery is explicitly described as a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist complex.  Vajrayana Buddhism, while a significant branch of Buddhism, is not represented at this particular site.  This distinction underscores the need for accurate identification of Buddhist schools and their associated practices in archaeological contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly explains the etymology of "Bavikonda" as "hill of wells," directly linking the name to the presence of wells used for rainwater storage. This highlights the importance of understanding the environmental context and resource management strategies of ancient settlements.  The name itself provides a valuable clue into the historical usage of the site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Despite significant efforts, the Indus script remains undeciphered.  Our understanding of Indus civilization's social and political organization is therefore based on archaeological findings and inferences, not direct textual evidence. The undeciphered nature of the script presents a major challenge to historical research.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly notes that Mesopotamian texts refer to the Indus region as "Meluha" and identify intermediary trading locations such as Dilmun. This evidence demonstrates the existence of extensive trade networks connecting the Indus Valley Civilization with other ancient civilizations in the region.  The identification of these trade routes and partners provides crucial insights into the economic and cultural interactions of the time.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text attributes the major naval expedition to the Sailendra Empire (including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra) to Rajendra Chola I, not Rajaraja Chola I.  Attributing the conquests to the wrong ruler demonstrates a lack of understanding of Chola history and the timeline of their naval expansion.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions that Rajendra Chola I's naval conquest resulted in the annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka as a Chola province.  This highlights the extent of Chola power and influence in the region.

2.  Notable recipients of the award include Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, and Waheeda Rehman; and the award is primarily given to recognize contributions in acting, with other cinematic fields having less emphasis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the description of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award as India's highest cinematic honor, its annual presentation by the Directorate of Film Festivals, its establishment in 1969 to honor Dadasaheb Phalke, and the inclusion of a Golden Lotus medallion and shawl are all accurate, the cash prize amount is incorrect. The source text states the prize is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs. This factual error renders the entire statement false.

Statement 2 is correct. The listed recipients (Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, and Waheeda Rehman) are all accurate according to the provided text.  Although the text doesn't explicitly state that acting is the primary focus, the list of recipients heavily emphasizes actors, making the second part of the statement a reasonable inference based on the available data. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, conferred by the President upon individuals for exceptional service in any field;  recommendations for the award are made formally by a dedicated committee of experts, and the award includes a significant monetary component.
2.  The award's design features a peepal leaf shape with 'Bharat Ratna' inscribed in Devanagari script, 'Satyameva Jayate' on the reverse, and is manufactured at the Alipore Mint in Kolkata;  the award is not conferred posthumously, and  only Indian citizens are eligible for the award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in two aspects. First, while the Bharat Ratna is indeed India's highest civilian award conferred by the President, the statement that recommendations are made formally by a dedicated committee is inaccurate. The source states that recommendations are made by the Prime Minister, not a formal committee. Secondly, the statement incorrectly claims the award includes a monetary component; the source explicitly states it does not.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The description of the Bharat Ratna's design is accurate, but the claims that the award is *not* conferred posthumously and that only Indian citizens are eligible are both false. The source text clearly mentions that the award is conferred posthumously (a change made in 1966) and that non-Indians have received the award (e.g., Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela). Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies and are incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Instituted in 1954, the Padma Awards are among India's highest civilian honors, announced annually on Republic Day, and conferred in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri; and the awards are typically not conferred posthumously.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The source text clearly states that the Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, based on write-ups from retiring government employees via the Anubhav Portal.  The aim to foster good governance and administrative reforms is also correctly reflected.

Statement 2 is partially inaccurate. While the location of the 7th Anubhav Awards Ceremony is correctly stated, the assertion that the awards primarily focus on innovation and technological advancements is not supported by the text. The source text emphasizes the use of employee experience to improve future governance and administrative reforms, not technological aspects.  This makes the statement misleading. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**7. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are Gallantry Awards, announced twice a year (on Republic Day and Independence Day), with their order of precedence being Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra.
2.  Wartime Gallantry Awards (Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra) were instituted in 1950, and Peacetime Gallantry Awards (Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra) were instituted in 1952 and renamed in 1967.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the information provided in the source text regarding Gallantry Awards. Statement 1 correctly lists the awards, their announcement frequency, and order of precedence.

1. Established in 1954, initially called 'State Awards,' the National Film Awards are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals since 1973 and are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema; and the awards initially included President's Gold Medals, certificates of merit, and silver medals.
2. The National Film Awards also include the 'Most Film-Friendly State' award, given to a state that has significantly contributed to the growth of the film industry; and the awards are given only to Indian films.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the National Film Awards, correctly mentioning their establishment year, initial name, administering body (since 1973), award categories, and the types of awards presented in earlier years.  All details are supported by the source text.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the inclusion of the 'Most Film-Friendly State' award is accurate, the claim that the awards are given only to Indian films is not explicitly stated or implied in the source text. The text focuses on the structure and administration of the awards, not their scope of eligibility.  This makes the statement incomplete and potentially misleading.  Therefore, only statement 1 is fully correct.


**9. With reference to the Miyawaki method of afforestation, consider the following statements:**

1. The Miyawaki method, developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, involves planting diverse native tree species in close proximity to promote rapid growth and biodiversity; and  the method is suitable only for large-scale afforestation projects.
2.  Saplings are planted close together in the Miyawaki method, creating competition for sunlight and encouraging vertical growth, suppressing weed growth, and creating a self-sustaining ecosystem; and mature Miyawaki forests are not drought-resistant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the description of the Miyawaki method and its developer is accurate, the claim that it is suitable *only* for large-scale projects is false. The source text mentions its use in creating one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests but also implies its applicability to smaller spaces, such as those in urban areas. This limits the statement's accuracy.

Statement 2 correctly describes the close planting of saplings in the Miyawaki method and its effect on growth, weed suppression, and ecosystem creation. However, the claim that mature Miyawaki forests are *not* drought-resistant is inaccurate.  The source text suggests the opposite, implying drought resistance after the initial establishment phase.  Therefore, only statement 2, with its correction, is mostly accurate; though the second part is slightly misleading.


**10. With reference to the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. Launched in 1992, the MoW program maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National; and the Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2. The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register was decided at the 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; and the MoW program primarily focuses on preserving digital archives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) program, its launch year, the three types of registers it maintains, and the inclusion of specific Indian literary works in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register. All details are supported by the source text.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  While the location and decision-making body for the inclusion of the Indian manuscripts are correctly stated, the claim that the MoW program primarily focuses on digital archives is not supported by or implied in the source text. The text's focus on manuscripts suggests a broader scope encompassing various forms of documentation, not just digital ones.  This makes the statement inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 1 is fully correct.



**1. With reference to National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1.  The day commemorates the launch of the Swadeshi Movement in 1905, aiming to promote Indian-made products, including handloom textiles.
2.  The handloom industry is India's largest cottage industry and the primary employment provider in rural areas, with a majority of its workforce comprising men.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. National Handloom Day, celebrated annually on August 7th, commemorates the launch of the Swadeshi Movement on that date in 1905.  The Swadeshi Movement actively promoted the use of Indian-made goods, including handloom textiles, as a form of resistance against British rule.  This historical context is central to the significance of National Handloom Day.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the handloom industry is indeed a significant cottage industry in India, it's not the *primary* employment provider in rural areas.  The statement also misrepresents the gender demographics of the workforce.  While a substantial portion of handloom workers are women (70% according to the provided text), the statement incorrectly claims that the majority are men.  This factual inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.  Understanding the actual demographics of the handloom workforce is crucial for comprehending the socio-economic impact of the industry.  The statement's inaccuracy regarding employment prominence and gender distribution renders it entirely false.


**2. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1.  Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*, which is known for its ability to survive and produce silk even in harsh environmental conditions.
2.  The Oeko-Tex certification for Eri silk signifies its production adheres to stringent environmental standards, ensuring it's free from harmful substances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Eri silk is not produced by *Bombyx mori*.  *Bombyx mori* is the silkworm that produces mulberry silk. Eri silk is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*. The provided text highlights the unique characteristic of Eri silk production: the moth is not killed to harvest the silk, unlike in mulberry silk production. This crucial difference in the production process is a key differentiator between Eri silk and other types of silk.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Oeko-Tex certification, which the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation obtained for its Eri silk, guarantees that the textiles are rigorously tested for harmful substances and produced in environmentally friendly conditions. This certification is a significant factor in the global market for sustainable and ethically produced textiles.  The certification's emphasis on environmental responsibility and product safety makes it a crucial aspect of understanding the quality and market positioning of Eri silk.


**3. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

2.  Genetic evidence suggests interbreeding between Denisovans and Neanderthals, but not between Denisovans and modern humans.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Denisovans are a close relative to modern humans and shared a common ancestor (*Homo heidelbergensis*) with both Neanderthals and modern humans. This indicates that Denisovans coexisted not only with Neanderthals but also with the ancestors of modern humans.  The shared ancestry and the geographical range spanning Siberia to Southeast Asia highlight the extensive temporal and spatial overlap between Denisovans and the evolutionary lineage leading to modern humans.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The provided text clearly mentions that DNA evidence suggests Denisovans interbred with *both* Neanderthals and modern humans. This interbreeding implies a complex interaction and gene flow between Denisovans and both other groups. The text's explicit mention of interbreeding with both Neanderthals and modern humans directly contradicts the statement's assertion.  The genetic evidence of interbreeding is a critical piece of information in understanding the evolutionary relationships between these hominin groups.


**4.  With reference to the Chola Dynasty's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I's naval conquests extended to Sri Lanka, resulting in the annexation of its southern part, but not the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, significantly expanding the Chola empire's influence in Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that Rajaraja Chola I led a conquest of Sri Lanka, annexing its *northern* part, and also conquered the Maldives. The statement incorrectly identifies the annexed part of Sri Lanka as the south and omits the Maldives entirely.  Precision in geographical details is vital when discussing historical events.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions successfully reached and conquered regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion significantly extended the Chola empire's reach into Southeast Asia, demonstrating their powerful naval capabilities and far-reaching influence.  The extent of Rajendra Chola I's conquests is an important aspect of understanding the scale and impact of the Chola empire.


**5. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance is a traditional practice primarily associated with agricultural communities who migrate seasonally in search of better arable land.
2.  In India, transhumance is predominantly observed in the Himalayan region, with nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas practicing seasonal livestock migration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While seasonal migration is involved, transhumance is primarily associated with *pastoral* communities, those who raise livestock, not agricultural communities focused on arable land. The movement is driven by the need to provide grazing for livestock, not primarily for cultivating crops. The core aspect of transhumance is the seasonal movement of livestock and the associated human communities.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, where several nomadic tribes engage in seasonal livestock migration between subalpine/alpine pastures in summer and adjoining plains in winter.  The mention of specific tribes and their practices provides concrete evidence of the prevalence of transhumance in the Indian Himalayas. The geographical specificity adds depth to the understanding of this traditional practice.

1.  The MoW programme was launched in 2003 and maintains a single, unified register of significant documentary heritage worldwide.
2.  Manuscripts of three Indian literary works—Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana—were recently included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW programme was launched in 1992, not 2003.  Furthermore, the programme maintains three separate registers: International, Regional, and National.  The statement incorrectly conflates the timing of the programme's launch and the structure of its registration system.  Correctly identifying the launch year and the multi-tiered registration system is key to understanding the MoW's scope and function.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were recently included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This inclusion highlights the recognition of these works' cultural and historical significance at a regional level.  The specific inclusion of these Indian works demonstrates the program's reach and impact on preserving significant cultural heritage.


**7. With reference to the Summer Solstice, consider the following statements:**

1. On the Summer Solstice, the Southern Hemisphere experiences the longest day and shortest night.
2.  During the Summer Solstice, the North Pole is inclined towards the sun, resulting in continuous daylight for about six months in regions beyond the Arctic Circle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that on the Summer Solstice, the conditions in the Southern Hemisphere are reversed. Since the Northern Hemisphere experiences the longest day and shortest night, the Southern Hemisphere experiences the opposite: the shortest day and longest night.  Understanding the hemispheric differences in the effects of the solstice is vital for a complete understanding of the phenomenon.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage clearly explains that the North Pole is inclined toward the sun during the Summer Solstice, leading to continuous daylight for approximately six months in areas beyond the Arctic Circle.  This explanation of the phenomenon's effect on polar regions is a key aspect of understanding the Summer Solstice.  The description of continuous daylight is a significant characteristic of the solstice in high-latitude regions.


**8. With reference to the Flag Code of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Flag Code of India, 2002, allows for the display of the National Flag only during daytime.
2. The National Flag can be made from any material, including synthetic fabrics, as long as it adheres to the specified size and color ratios.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that a 2022 amendment to the Flag Code of India allows for the display of the National Flag both day and night.  The original restriction to daytime display has been lifted.  Understanding the changes and amendments to the Flag Code is crucial for accurate interpretation of its regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 2021 amendment expanded the permissible materials to include machine-made cotton/polyester/wool/silk/Ichadi bunting, the statement is too broad.  The Flag Code specifies materials and does not allow for *any* material.  The restrictions on materials are a key aspect of the Flag Code's regulations.  The statement's lack of precision regarding the allowed materials makes it inaccurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Kasturi Cotton is indeed a premium quality cotton, the provided text does not restrict its production to only the southern states of India.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that Project PARI is a collaboration between the Ministry of Culture, Lalit Kala Akademi, and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum of India.  The correct identification of the collaborating institutions is essential for understanding the project's organizational structure and implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that Project PARI aims to democratize art through public installations in urban landscapes. This goal of making art more accessible to the public is a core objective of the project. The description of the project's aim clearly highlights its focus on public engagement and accessibility.


**11. With reference to Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative focuses exclusively on promoting eco-tourism in protected areas across India.
2.  The Ministry of Tourism launched this national responsible tourism initiative across 50 tourist destinations in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text does not specify that the initiative focuses *exclusively* on eco-tourism in protected areas. While responsible tourism is likely a component, the text does not limit the initiative's scope to this specific area. The statement's restrictive nature makes it inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Ministry of Tourism launched the "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative across 50 tourist destinations in India.  The mention of the ministry, the name of the initiative, and the number of destinations are all accurate details from the given text.  The text's explicit mention of the initiative's launch and scope makes this statement entirely correct.

1. Swami Vivekananda is primarily known for his contributions to the Bhakti movement in India.
2. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which engages in various social service activities, including running educational institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda's contributions were primarily in the realm of Vedanta philosophy and its propagation in the West, not in the Bhakti movement. While he was a follower of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, his work focused on a different philosophical tradition. The statement misrepresents the core focus of his teachings and philosophical contributions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Swami Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which actively undertakes various social service initiatives, including the operation of hospitals and educational institutions.  The accurate mention of the organization's founding and its social work makes the statement entirely correct.


**13. With reference to Ratan Tata's accomplishments, consider the following statements:**

1. Under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion, making it one of the largest employers in India.
2. Ratan Tata received the Padma Shri award in recognition of his contributions to Indian industry and philanthropy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that under Ratan Tata's leadership, the Tata Group's revenue dramatically increased from $5 billion to over $100 billion, establishing it as one of India's largest employers.  This significant growth is a well-documented aspect of his tenure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage lists several awards received by Ratan Tata, including the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan, but not the Padma Shri.  The statement mistakenly identifies an award he did not receive.  The accurate identification of the awards he received is important for a factual representation of his accolades.


**14. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the Prime Minister of India upon the recommendation of a formally constituted selection committee.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a monetary grant along with the award's certificate and medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clarifies that while the Prime Minister makes the recommendation to the President, there is no formally constituted selection committee for the Bharat Ratna.  The statement incorrectly describes the award's selection process.  The text's description of the recommendation process is crucial for accurate understanding of the award's procedures.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that the Bharat Ratna does *not* come with any monetary grant.  The statement's assertion of a monetary component is factually inaccurate.  The absence of a monetary component is a key feature of the Bharat Ratna.


**15. With reference to the Chandravalli Cave Complex, consider the following statements:**

1. The cave complex is located in the Hassan district of Karnataka and is known for its intricate rock carvings dating back to the Paleolithic period.
2. The complex features chambers used for worship, accommodation, and possibly as an educational center (Gurukul), reflecting its multi-functional nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage specifies that the Chandravalli Cave Complex is located in the Chitradurga district of Karnataka, not Hassan.  It also clarifies that the complex's origins date back to prehistoric times, with evidence from the Iron Age, not the Paleolithic period.  The statement contains inaccuracies regarding both location and the era of the carvings.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Chandravalli Cave Complex as having chambers used for worship (Shiva linga), accommodation (for visitors and sadhus), and possibly as an educational center (Gurukul).  The description of the complex's multi-functional nature is accurate.  The description of the chambers highlights the complex's versatility and historical significance.


**16. With reference to Classical Languages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Government of India first designated languages as "Classical Languages" in 2008, recognizing their historical and cultural significance.
2.  Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali have recently been granted Classical Language status by the Union Cabinet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the Government of India first created the category of "Classical Languages" in 2004, not 2008.  The statement contains an error in the year of the designation.  The correct year is crucial for accurate historical context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions that the Union Cabinet recently approved Classical Language status for Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali.  The list of languages and the action taken by the Union Cabinet are accurately reflected in the statement.  The statement accurately reflects a recent development in the official recognition of Indian languages.


**17. With reference to Megalithic culture in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Megalithic burials are primarily associated with the Neolithic period and are characterized by the use of large stones to construct burial chambers.
2.  Hire Benkal, a megalithic site in Karnataka, is currently on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage correctly associates megalithic burials with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period and highlights their defining characteristic of using large stones in burial construction.  The description of megalithic burials is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions that Hire Benkal is *under consideration* for the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites, but it is not yet on the official list. The statement incorrectly assumes its inclusion in the UNESCO list.  The distinction between being under consideration and being officially listed is crucial.


**18. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Dynasty, established in the 13th century, was characterized by a strong centralized monarchy with absolute power vested in the king.
2.  The Ahoms adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, patronizing the construction of temples, including the Kamakhya Devi temple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that while the Ahom Dynasty was a monarchy, power was significantly vested in the Council of Ministry.  A king's appointment required the concurrence of the Patra Mantris.  The statement incorrectly portrays the Ahom political system as a centralized monarchy with absolute power in the king.  The description of the council's influence is crucial for understanding the dynasty's political structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately mentions that the Ahoms adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, and patronized the construction and rebuilding of numerous temples, including the Kamakhya Devi temple.  The description of their religious patronage is accurate.  The mention of specific religious practices and temple patronage is important for understanding the dynasty's cultural impact.


**19. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut), consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, located on the Coromandel Coast, was a significant center for spice trade during the medieval period.
2. The term "calico," referring to a type of fine cotton cloth, is believed to have originated from Kozhikode.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode is located on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast.  The statement contains a geographical inaccuracy. The correct coastal region is essential for accurate historical and geographical context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions that the term "calico" is believed to have derived from "Calicut" (Kozhikode).  The connection between the city's name and the term for cotton cloth is accurately described.  The etymology of "calico" is a significant aspect of Kozhikode's historical and cultural significance.


**20. With reference to the South African Anti-Apartheid Struggle, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to the struggle was primarily limited to providing financial aid to the African National Congress (ANC) during the 1980s.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi's experiences in South Africa significantly shaped his philosophy of Satyagraha and influenced his later leadership in India's independence movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India did provide financial aid, its contribution to the struggle was far broader.  The passage mentions severing trade relations with the apartheid government, raising the issue at the UN, and maintaining an ANC representative office in New Delhi.  The statement underestimates the extent of India's involvement.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly highlights Mahatma Gandhi's role in establishing early anti-colonial and anti-racial discrimination movements in South Africa and his development of Satyagraha, which significantly influenced his later leadership in India.  The passage clearly links Gandhi's South African experiences to his later philosophy and actions in India.  This connection is a crucial element in understanding the development of Gandhian thought.



**1. With reference to the Kashi Culture Pathway, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is an initiative endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group to combat the illicit trafficking of cultural artifacts.
2.  It primarily focuses on the repatriation of Indian antiquities currently held in museums outside India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kashi Culture Pathway, as an outcome of the G20 Culture Working Group, indeed aims to bolster the global fight against illicit trafficking of cultural property.  However, its focus isn't solely on repatriation of existing artifacts. While repatriation is a significant aspect of combating illicit trade, the Kashi Culture Pathway encompasses a broader strategy involving prevention, detection, and international cooperation to disrupt the networks involved in this illegal activity.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct, reflecting the initiative's overarching goal. Statement 2 is incorrect because it narrows the scope of the initiative, overemphasizing repatriation while overlooking the preventative and collaborative dimensions.  The Kashi Culture Pathway seeks to address the problem holistically, rather than focusing exclusively on retrieving already trafficked items.  Understanding the difference between addressing the root causes of illicit trafficking and simply recovering stolen goods is crucial for a nuanced understanding of cultural heritage protection initiatives.


**2. With reference to the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 3 of the Act completely prohibits the export of any antiquity from India, regardless of its provenance or ownership.
2. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is solely responsible for the investigation and prosecution of all cases involving the illicit trafficking of antiquities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, significantly restricts the export of antiquities, it doesn't create an absolute prohibition.  There are provisions for export under specific circumstances, such as with permission from the appropriate authorities. Therefore, statement 1 presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the Act's provisions. The ASI plays a vital role in coordinating the recovery of antiquities, but it isn't solely responsible for investigations and prosecutions. Law enforcement agencies, customs officials, and other relevant bodies are also involved in these processes, depending on the specific nature of the case and its jurisdiction.  Statement 2, therefore, overstates the ASI's role and authority. A thorough understanding of the Act requires appreciating the complexities of its implementation and the collaborative nature of enforcing its provisions. The Act's focus is broader than just the ASI's actions; it encompasses a larger framework of legal mechanisms and institutional collaborations.


**3. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014, primarily due to the global popularity of yoga as a fitness regimen.
2. The proposal for IYD was initiated by India and garnered support from over 170 member states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the global popularity of yoga undoubtedly contributed to the UN's decision, the proclamation of June 21st as IYD in 2014 was also driven by a recognition of yoga's holistic approach to health and well-being, its cultural significance, and its potential to promote peace and harmony.  Statement 1 therefore, oversimplifies the rationale behind the UN's decision.  India's initiative in proposing the IYD is well-documented, and the fact that it received support from a record 175 member states highlights the international recognition of yoga's significance. The number in statement 2 is slightly off, but the core fact remains accurate.  The overwhelming support reflects the broad appeal of yoga transcending geographical and cultural boundaries.   The successful adoption of the resolution demonstrates the effectiveness of India's cultural diplomacy.


**4. With reference to Yoga's historical context, consider the following statements:**

1.  Systematic references to yoga practices are primarily found in Patanjali's Yogasutra, dating back to the 2nd century CE.
2.  The Indus Valley Civilization's seals and artifacts conclusively prove the widespread practice of yoga during that era.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While archaeological evidence suggests the presence of practices that might be related to yoga in the Indus Valley Civilization, a definitive proof of widespread yoga practice during that era remains elusive.  The interpretation of seals and artifacts is often subject to debate and lacks the conclusive evidence to support a claim of widespread yoga practice. Therefore, statement 2 is an overstatement.  Patanjali's Yogasutra, however, provides a systematic and detailed compilation of yoga philosophy and practices, offering a crucial landmark in the history of yoga.  The dating of the Yogasutra to the 2nd century BCE is widely accepted by scholars, making statement 1 a factually accurate representation of the development of yoga philosophy. The distinction between suggestive evidence and conclusive proof is vital when analyzing historical claims, particularly those concerning practices as complex as yoga.


**5. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra symbolizes fearlessness and is predominantly associated with the Buddha.
2.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra, in contrast, represents the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Abhaya Mudra, with its raised right hand, is indeed a well-known symbol of fearlessness and reassurance, frequently depicted in Buddhist art and iconography.  The association with the Buddha and his teachings of compassion and liberation is central to its meaning. Therefore, statement 1 is accurate.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra, often called the "earth-touching" mudra, depicts the Buddha calling upon the earth to witness his victory over Mara, the personification of evil and temptation, during his enlightenment.  This mudra vividly illustrates a pivotal moment in the Buddha's journey to enlightenment.  Statement 2, therefore, also accurately describes the significance of the Bhumisparsha Mudra.  Both statements correctly identify the symbolism and significance of these two important Buddhist mudras. Understanding the nuances of different mudras provides insight into the rich symbolism and visual language of Buddhist art and iconography.


**6. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA by restricting the import of specific artifacts.
2.  The agreement mandates the immediate repatriation of all Indian antiquities found in the USA, regardless of their legal acquisition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) primarily focuses on preventing the illegal import of specific categories of Indian antiquities into the United States. By restricting the importation of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin, the agreement aims to disrupt the flow of illicitly trafficked artifacts. Therefore, statement 1 accurately describes a key objective of the agreement.  Statement 2, however, is an oversimplification.  The CPA doesn't automatically mandate the immediate repatriation of *all* Indian antiquities in the USA. The process involves legal procedures, investigations, and potentially negotiations, depending on the circumstances of each case.  The agreement provides a framework for cooperation and legal mechanisms to address illicit trafficking, but it doesn't guarantee automatic repatriation in every instance.  The nuances of international legal frameworks and the complexities of repatriation processes are important considerations in evaluating the CPA's effectiveness.


**7. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval campaigns extended to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, resulting in the annexation of significant territories.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquests primarily focused on land-based campaigns within the Indian subcontinent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Rajaraja Chola I's reign witnessed significant naval expansion, with successful campaigns against the Cheras and conquests extending to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. These expeditions established the Chola navy's dominance in the Indian Ocean and resulted in the annexation of territories.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this historical reality.  Rajendra Chola I, however, also undertook significant naval expeditions, notably against the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia, extending Chola influence far beyond the Indian subcontinent.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect as it understates the extent of Rajendra Chola I's naval ambitions.  His conquests were not limited to land-based campaigns.  A comprehensive understanding of the Chola Empire necessitates recognizing the crucial role of their navy in shaping their power and influence across a vast geographical expanse.


**8. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a traditional practice primarily associated with pastoral communities in mountainous regions.
2. Transhumance systems are increasingly threatened by climate change and land-use changes, impacting the livelihoods of pastoral communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Transhumance, the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities between different pastures, is deeply ingrained in the cultural and economic practices of pastoral societies, particularly those inhabiting mountainous or geographically diverse regions.  Statement 1 correctly highlights this key aspect of transhumance.  However, modern pressures such as climate change, land-use conflicts, and urbanization significantly threaten traditional transhumance systems, disrupting the established patterns of livestock migration and negatively impacting the livelihoods and cultural practices of pastoral communities. Statement 2 accurately reflects these challenges.  Therefore, both statements offer accurate insights into the nature and challenges of transhumance.  Understanding the fragility of these traditional systems in the face of modern pressures is crucial for developing sustainable strategies to support pastoral communities.



**9. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW program aims to preserve and provide access to significant documentary heritage materials worldwide.
2. The inclusion of Indian literary works in the Asia-Pacific Register indicates that only manuscripts written in Sanskrit are eligible for inclusion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO Memory of the World (MoW) program indeed aims to safeguard and promote access to documentary heritage of global significance, recognizing its importance for cultural preservation and historical understanding. This overarching goal is accurately reflected in statement 1.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The inclusion of works like the *Ramcharitmanas* (written in Awadhi) and *Panchatantra* (written in Sanskrit) in the Asia-Pacific Register demonstrates that the program is inclusive of various languages and scripts. The selection criteria focus on the significance and historical value of the documents, not their language of origin.  The diverse linguistic representation within the register highlights the program's commitment to reflecting the richness and diversity of cultural heritage across the Asia-Pacific region.


**10. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to the most outstanding writers from each major Indian language.
2.  The fellowship is primarily intended to recognize lifetime achievements in literature and is considered a prestigious honor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is indeed the highest honor conferred by the Sahitya Akademi, recognizing exceptional contributions to Indian literature.  It's not awarded annually to writers from each major Indian language; rather, it is bestowed upon a select group of eminent writers throughout their careers. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 accurately reflects the fellowship's intent to recognize lifetime achievements and its status as a highly prestigious award in the Indian literary world. The fellowship is reserved for those who have made exceptional and enduring contributions to literature, making it a highly coveted honor.  The distinction between annual awards and lifetime achievement awards is critical in understanding the nature and prestige of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.


**11. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Day (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the descent of the Buddha from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, a celestial realm.
2.  The event is primarily celebrated by the Buddhist community in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

International Abhidhamma Day does commemorate the Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, a significant event in Buddhist tradition. This event marks the Buddha's return to the human realm after spending three months teaching the Abhidhamma to the devas.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this central aspect of the celebration.  However, while IAD is celebrated by the Buddhist community in India, its observance extends far beyond India, with Buddhist communities globally participating in the commemorations. Statement 2, therefore, limits the scope of the celebration, overlooking its international significance.  The global reach of IAD underscores the unifying nature of Buddhist traditions and the universality of the Buddha's teachings.


**12. With reference to Megalithic Burials, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists are a type of megalithic burial structure characterized by large, unchambered stone enclosures.
2.  Megalithic burial sites provide insights into the social structures and burial practices of pre-historic communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dolmenoid cists are, in fact, chamber tombs, not unchambered enclosures. They are characterized by their semi-subterranean nature and the presence of a covered chamber. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect.  Megalithic burial sites, however, offer valuable insights into the social organization, burial rituals, and cultural practices of prehistoric and early historic communities. The size, construction, and contents of these structures provide clues to social hierarchies, beliefs about the afterlife, and the technological capabilities of the societies that created them. Statement 2 accurately reflects the significance of these sites for archaeological research.  The careful analysis of megalithic structures allows archaeologists to reconstruct aspects of past societies that are otherwise difficult to discern.


**13. With reference to the Phanigiri site in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Phanigiri is primarily known for its association with the Satavahana dynasty and its extensive Buddhist monasteries.
2.  Archaeological excavations at Phanigiri have unearthed a significant collection of coins from the Ikshvaku period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Phanigiri is indeed associated with both the Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods, with evidence of Buddhist settlements and structures from both eras.  The site's significance extends to both dynasties, making statement 1 partially correct.  Recent archaeological discoveries at Phanigiri have also brought to light a significant hoard of coins dating back to the Ikshvaku period, providing valuable insights into the numismatics and economy of that era.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.  The coexistence of evidence from different historical periods highlights the site's importance as a long-lasting center of activity, offering a layered perspective on its history and cultural evolution.  The rich archaeological finds at Phanigiri contribute significantly to our understanding of the region's past.


**14. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery, consider the following statements:**

1. Bavikonda Monastery is located near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, and is associated with Mahayana Buddhism.
2.  The monastery's structures include a Mahastupa, Chaitya Griha, and other characteristic features of Buddhist monastic complexes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bavikonda Monastery's location near Visakhapatnam is accurate, but it's associated with Theravada (Hinayana), not Mahayana Buddhism.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The presence of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Griha, and other typical features of Buddhist monastic complexes is well-documented at Bavikonda. These structures reflect the architectural and religious practices of the Buddhist community that inhabited the site.  Thus, statement 2 is correct.  The architectural features provide valuable insights into the design and layout of Buddhist monasteries during that period and the nature of monastic life. The distinction between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism is crucial for understanding the diverse branches of the faith and their respective traditions.


**15. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE and flourished as a major center of learning until its destruction in the 13th century CE.
2.  The university's curriculum encompassed a wide range of subjects, including Buddhist philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and the arts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The founding of Nalanda University by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE and its prominence as a major center of learning are well-established historical facts.  Its eventual destruction occurred in the 12th century CE (not the 13th), making statement 1 largely correct.

The rebellion was a direct response to the injustices and oppression faced by the Santhal people.  Statement 1 accurately captures this central cause of the rebellion.  However, while the British successfully suppressed the rebellion militarily, its impact on Santhal society was far from minimal. The rebellion led to the creation of the Santhal Parganas, a separate administrative region, and it also had a lasting impact on Santhal land rights and social organization.

The Odisha famine serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences of natural disasters and the need for effective famine relief strategies.

The initial reluctance to grant the award posthumously reflects a focus on recognizing living individuals for their ongoing contributions.

Statement 2 is correct. The reverse side of the Bharat Ratna medal features the phrase "Satyameva Jayate" in Devanagari script, positioned beneath the state emblem.

This minor error demonstrates the need for accuracy in recalling historical facts. The annual conferral of the awards highlights their consistent recognition of exceptional contributions across various fields.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Padma Awards are given in three categories—Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri—not four.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

The Saluva dynasty came to power *after* the decline of the Sangama dynasty.  The chronological order is crucial here; understanding the succession of dynasties is fundamental to comprehending the empire's evolution.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I was a powerful Chola ruler with a strong navy, his major naval expeditions primarily focused on the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, the invasion and annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka, and a conquest of the Maldives.  The significant expansion into the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, leading to the conquest of regions and the impact on the Sailendra Empire, was primarily achieved under Rajendra I, his successor.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's naval campaign against Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province. This represents a critical expansion of the Chola Empire's power and influence, showcasing the empire's naval dominance in the region.

It involved a diverse range of participants and organizers who contributed significantly to its success.  The statement simplifies the complex leadership structure of the movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha, though initially achieving partial success, ultimately contributed significantly to the landmark Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.  This proclamation legally granted lower-caste individuals access to temples, marking a significant step towards social reform and equality in Travancore.  The statement highlights a key long-term consequence of the Satyagraha, demonstrating a deeper understanding of its historical impact beyond its immediate outcome.  The other options are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the leadership of the movement and its long-term effect.

A key element of the initiative is the use of blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of Indian cotton, enhancing its quality and reputation in the global market.  The statement correctly identifies both the implementing agency and the use of blockchain technology, indicating a thorough understanding of the project's mechanisms.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IAD commemorates the day when Lord Buddha descended from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka (celestial realm) to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) in Uttar Pradesh, not his attainment of enlightenment.  The event commemorated by IAD is a specific point in Buddha's life, distinct from his enlightenment.  The statement confuses two significant events in Buddhist history.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), did indeed observe IAD and celebrated the recent declaration of Pali as a classical language by the Indian Cabinet.  This statement correctly identifies the organizations involved in the observation of IAD and accurately reflects the significance of the event in the context of Buddhist studies and cultural preservation.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while recognizing the importance of transhumance in the Himalayas, is not solely focused on this region.  It has a broader scope, encompassing transhumance practices across various parts of the world.  The statement limits the initiative's scope inappropriately.

Statement 2 is correct. UNESCO has indeed recognized certain transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, highlighting their cultural value and significance.  This recognition underscores the importance of preserving these traditional practices and the knowledge associated with them. The statement correctly reflects UNESCO's recognition of the cultural importance of transhumance.

**2. With reference to the Miyawaki method of afforestation, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a technique primarily used for creating dense, biodiverse forests in urban areas, emphasizing the use of native tree species.
2.  The method involves planting trees at wide spacing to allow for optimal sunlight penetration and individual tree growth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Miyawaki method, developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, is specifically designed to establish dense, fast-growing, and highly biodiverse forests, particularly in urban environments.  A key principle of the method is utilizing native tree species to maximize ecological integration and resilience.  The close planting of diverse species promotes rapid growth and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sangameshwar Temple is indeed dedicated to Lord Shiva and is located in Andhra Pradesh, it is situated at the confluence of the Krishna River and its tributaries, not the Tungabhadra River. The specific location is in the Nandyal district, and the annual submergence is due to the Srisailam dam's backwaters.

Statement 2 is correct. The annual submergence of the Sangameshwar Temple in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam poses a significant threat to its preservation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple's architecture is not a blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles.  While it exhibits elements of classical Indian temple architecture, its style is unique and doesn't neatly fit into either the Dravidian or Nagara classifications. The description of the temple's shikhara (tower) and other features highlights this unique architectural character.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vajrasana, a significant feature within the Mahabodhi Temple Complex, is a polished sandstone platform precisely marking the spot where Buddha is believed to have sat and meditated while attaining enlightenment.  This platform holds immense religious significance for Buddhists worldwide and is a central element of the temple complex.

2.  Mahatma Gandhi's involvement was limited to offering moral support, while E.V. Ramasamy Naicker played a crucial role in mobilizing volunteers and garnering public support, facing rigorous imprisonment for his participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha, while significantly led by Ezhava community members alongside others, did not achieve immediate and complete success in opening all four roads to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple within the first year.  The Satyagraha lasted for 604 days and only partially succeeded in opening three out of the four roads.  The complete opening of all access routes to the temple was a later development, achieved through the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.  This highlights the limitations of the initial phase of the movement and the protracted nature of the struggle against caste-based discrimination.


Statement 2 is correct.  While Mahatma Gandhi offered support and his presence lent weight to the movement, E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was instrumental in galvanizing mass participation and public awareness.  His leadership and commitment were pivotal in sustaining the Satyagraha.  The fact that Periyar received rigorous imprisonment while many others did not, underscores his central role and the risks he took in the movement.  This demonstrates the multifaceted nature of the leadership within the Vaikom Satyagraha and the distinct contributions of various individuals.

1.  The Saluva dynasty, known for its significant military expansions, succeeded the Tuluva dynasty, marking a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity for the empire.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign witnessed the empire's territorial expansion to include the Raichur Doab, subjugation of Orissa, and significant military victories against the Sultan of Bijapur, strengthening its political dominance in the region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Saluva dynasty *preceded* the Tuluva dynasty in the Vijayanagara Empire.  The Saluva dynasty's rule was a transitional period following the decline of the Sangama dynasty. It was the Tuluva dynasty that followed the Saluvas and under whose rule the empire reached its zenith. The statement incorrectly reverses the chronological order of these two dynasties, demonstrating a potential misunderstanding of the empire's succession.


Statement 2 is correct.  Krishnadevaraya's reign is indeed considered a high point in the Vijayanagara Empire's history, marked by significant territorial expansion and military success.  His conquests of the Raichur Doab, the subjugation of Orissa, and victories against the Sultan of Bijapur significantly extended the empire's boundaries and solidified its position as a dominant power in South India.  This accurately reflects the historical record of his military achievements and their impact on the empire's political landscape.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Kakori Train Robbery:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), led by Bhagat Singh, orchestrated the Kakori Train Robbery in 1925 to fund their revolutionary activities against British rule.
2.  The robbery, which took place near Lucknow, primarily targeted a British military supply train carrying crucial weapons and ammunition for the colonial army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) did indeed orchestrate the Kakori Train Robbery in 1925 to fund revolutionary activities, Bhagat Singh was not a key leader at that time.  Key figures involved were Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and others. Bhagat Singh's major involvement in revolutionary activities came later.  This demonstrates a crucial distinction in the timeline of revolutionary activities and the specific individuals involved in the Kakori conspiracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kakori Train Robbery targeted a British Indian Government treasury train carrying cash, not primarily a military supply train carrying weapons and ammunition. The objective was to acquire funds to finance further revolutionary activities.  Confusing the target of the robbery with military supplies represents a significant factual error regarding the event's nature and objectives.


**4. With reference to the Santhal Rebellion, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Santhal Rebellion, primarily led by religious leaders, was a peaceful protest against the oppressive Zamindari system prevalent in the region during the early 19th century.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Santhal Rebellion, while protesting against the oppressive Zamindari system, was not led primarily by religious leaders and was far from peaceful.  It was a major armed rebellion led by secular leaders like Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu against both the British East India Company and the exploitative Zamindari system. The description of the rebellion as a peaceful protest is a mischaracterization of its violent nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the rebellion involved grievances against the British East India Company, its primary focus was not solely on religious freedom. The rebellion was a broad-based socio-political uprising against the encroaching British administration, the oppressive Zamindari system, and the loss of Santhal lands.  Restricting the rebellion's motives to religious freedom ignores its wider socio-political dimensions.


**5. With reference to the  contributions of Ahilyabai Holkar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage primarily focused on promoting Sanskrit literature and religious texts, neglecting the development of vernacular languages and local arts.
2.  Her economic policies primarily centered on agricultural reforms, with little attention paid to the development of trade and commerce in the region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage extended beyond Sanskrit literature. She actively promoted various art forms, including local arts and vernacular languages.  Her support for the development of various arts and crafts, along with her promotion of education in vernacular languages, contradicts the claim of her exclusive focus on Sanskrit literature and religious texts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Ahilyabai Holkar's economic policies were not limited to agricultural reforms. She significantly contributed to the development of trade and commerce, making Maheshwar and Indore prominent centers of trade. The development of the Maheswari weaving industry under her patronage demonstrates her focus on economic diversification beyond agriculture.  The statement's narrow focus on agricultural reforms misrepresents the scope of her economic policies.


**6. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University, primarily known for its Buddhist studies, completely excluded the study of other religious traditions, particularly Hinduism and Jainism.
2.  The university's library, known as "Dharma Gunj," was destroyed during the invasion of Bakhtiyar Khalji, resulting in the complete loss of all its manuscripts and literary treasures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Nalanda University was a prominent center for Buddhist studies, it wasn't solely focused on Buddhism.  Scholars from various religious and philosophical backgrounds, including Hinduism and Jainism, studied and taught at Nalanda. The claim of complete exclusion of other traditions is inaccurate, demonstrating a misconception about the university's inclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the destruction of Nalanda University's library during Bakhtiyar Khalji's invasion was devastating, it's inaccurate to say that *all* manuscripts were lost. Some manuscripts likely survived, and archaeological discoveries continue to reveal fragments of the university's rich intellectual heritage.  The statement overstates the extent of the loss, creating a misleading impression of complete annihilation.


**7. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda, after his address at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, immediately established the Ramakrishna Mission to spread Vedanta philosophy globally.
2.  Swami Vivekananda's primary focus was on promoting traditional Hindu rituals and practices, with little emphasis on social reform or modern scientific thought.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of the World's Religions was a pivotal moment, the Ramakrishna Mission was established later, in 1897. The statement incorrectly links the immediate establishment of the mission to his Chicago address.


Statement 2 is incorrect. Swami Vivekananda's philosophy went beyond promoting traditional Hindu rituals. He advocated for social reform and encouraged a synthesis of traditional wisdom with modern scientific thought.  His emphasis on social service and his efforts to promote a scientific temperament contradict the claim of his exclusive focus on traditional rituals.  The statement presents a significantly incomplete and inaccurate portrayal of his multifaceted philosophy.


**8. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola's naval expeditions were primarily focused on land conquests in the Indian subcontinent, with limited involvement in overseas expansion.
2.  Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended Chola influence to regions in Southeast Asia, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja Chola's reign saw significant naval expansion and overseas conquests. His navy played a crucial role in his military successes, extending Chola influence beyond the Indian subcontinent. The statement misrepresents the extent of his naval activities and their geographical reach.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's reign is indeed marked by the expansion of Chola power into Southeast Asia through major naval expeditions.  His conquest of the Sailendra Empire resulted in the establishment of Chola influence in regions like the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This accurately reflects the historical record of Chola expansion under Rajendra Chola I.


**9. With reference to the  Odisha Famine of 1866, consider the following statements:**

1. The Odisha famine of 1866, also known as the "Na-Anka Famine," was primarily caused by a devastating earthquake that destroyed agricultural lands and disrupted food supply chains.
2. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, despite being the commissioner of the Odisha division during the famine, took minimal action to alleviate the suffering of the affected population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While natural disasters contributed to the Odisha famine of 1866, it wasn't primarily caused by a devastating earthquake. The famine resulted from a combination of factors, including crop failures, administrative negligence, and economic factors. Attributing the famine solely to an earthquake is an oversimplification of its complex causes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While criticism exists about the response to the Odisha famine, it's not accurate to say that Thomas Edward Ravenshaw took *minimal* action.  He did take some steps, though these were insufficient to prevent the widespread suffering and loss of life.  The statement presents an overly critical and potentially inaccurate assessment of his actions during the crisis.  The situation was complex, and there were various factors contributing to the inadequate response to the famine.


**10.  With reference to the Battle of Saragarhi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army and the Afghan army in 1897, resulting in a decisive victory for the British forces.
2.  All 21 Sikh soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment who fought in the Battle of Saragarhi were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army (specifically 21 soldiers of the 36th Sikh Regiment) and Afghan tribesmen (Afridi and Orakzai), not the Afghan army. The British ultimately were victorious because the communication post was saved, but the 21 Sikh soldiers died heroically.  The statement misidentifies the opposing force.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross. The Victoria Cross was the highest British military award, but the Indian Order of Merit was the highest award given to Indian troops at the time. This highlights a factual error concerning the specific military decoration awarded.


**1. With reference to ancient Indian religious sites, consider the following statements:**

1. The Salihundam site in Srikakulam district is significant for its association with the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra and other eastern countries.
2.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha, built during the 2nd century BCE, primarily served as dwelling places for Buddhist monks.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Salihundam in Srikakulam is indeed linked to the early spread of Buddhism eastward, including to regions like Sumatra.  Archaeological evidence supports this connection, indicating its role as a significant center for Buddhist propagation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built in the 2nd century BCE under King Kharavela, they were constructed for Jain monks, not Buddhist monks. This is a well-documented fact supported by historical inscriptions and the cave architecture itself which aligns with Jain monastic traditions.  The presence of Jain symbols and the historical context clearly point to their Jain affiliation.  Confusing the religious affiliation of the caves is a common misconception, making this a good distractor for the question.


**2. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, fought between the Mauryan Empire and Kalinga, resulted in the complete annihilation of the Kalinga kingdom and its culture.
2. King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty, known for his patronage of Jainism, is associated with the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves and the Hathigumpha inscription.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kalinga War significantly impacted Kalinga, leading to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, but it did not result in the complete destruction of the Kalinga kingdom and its culture. Kalinga continued to exist as a political entity and its cultural traditions persisted.  The statement overstates the consequences of the war, creating a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Kharavela's reign is well-documented through the Hathigumpha inscription, showcasing his patronage of Jainism and his role in the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves. This is a well-established fact in Indian history, showcasing Kharavela's importance as a patron of art and architecture.


**3. With reference to megalithic sites in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ooragutta site in Telangana is a significant example of an Iron Age megalithic site, characterized by the presence of dolmenoid cists as the primary burial structure.
2. Megalithic burial practices in India are exclusively associated with the Neolithic period, representing a homogenous cultural tradition across the subcontinent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Ooragutta in Telangana is indeed an important Iron Age megalithic site with dolmenoid cists.  The discovery and study of such sites have provided valuable insights into the Iron Age culture and burial practices of the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Megalithic burial practices spanned a longer period than just the Neolithic, extending into the Iron Age.  Furthermore, while there are similarities across regions, the megalithic culture wasn't entirely homogenous; regional variations in burial practices and associated artifacts existed.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the complexity of megalithic cultures in India.


**4.  With reference to prehistoric rock art in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The earliest known rock paintings in India, dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period, predominantly depict human figures engaged in hunting and warfare, rendered in vibrant colors.
2. Rock art from the Mesolithic period is characterized by a naturalistic style in depicting animals, contrasting with a more stylized representation of human figures.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Upper Paleolithic rock art does exist in India, the descriptions of the subjects and artistic style are inaccurate.  Early paintings often feature animals more prominently than humans, and the color palette was not always "vibrant." The statement oversimplifies and misrepresents the characteristics of the art.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mesolithic rock art exhibits a clear contrast between the naturalistic depiction of animals and the more stylized representation of human figures, reflecting a shift in artistic conventions.  This stylistic difference is a key characteristic used by archaeologists to differentiate between periods.


**5. With reference to ancient Indian universities, consider the following statements:**

1. Nalanda University was renowned for its focus on Buddhist studies, particularly in Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, but also incorporated other subjects like grammar, logic, and medicine.
2. Vikramshila University, known for its emphasis on Buddhist studies, was established after Nalanda University, and its alumni included notable figures like Atisha Dipankara.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nalanda was a center of learning with a wide range of subjects, not just limited to Buddhism.  Its multidisciplinary approach and reputation attracted scholars from various parts of Asia.

Statement 2 is correct. Vikramshila was indeed established later than Nalanda, and its association with prominent figures like Atisha Dipankara is well-documented, signifying its importance as a center for Buddhist learning and scholarship.


**6. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's architecture is a unique blend of Dravida and Nagara styles, incorporating elements from both traditions.
2. The Ratna Bhandar, the temple's treasury, houses only the jewels and precious ornaments belonging to the deities, with no other historical artifacts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Shree Jagannath Temple's architecture is unique and doesn't strictly adhere to either Dravida or Nagara styles exclusively; it displays a distinct blend of elements from both.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ratna Bhandar primarily contains jewels and ornaments of the deities, it is likely to contain other historical artifacts as well.  The statement is too restrictive and lacks nuance regarding the potential contents of the treasury.


**7. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to Lord Virupaksha (a form of Shiva), was primarily constructed during the Vijayanagara Empire, with minimal contributions from earlier dynasties.
2. The temple's architecture exemplifies the Dravida style, characterized by its grand gopurams, vimana, intricate carvings, and pillared halls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Vijayanagara Empire significantly expanded and embellished the Virupaksha Temple, its origins and construction involved contributions from earlier dynasties like the Chalukyas and Hoysalas. The statement ignores the temple's long and layered history.

Statement 2 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple's architecture is a prime example of the Dravida style, as described in the statement.  The architectural features mentioned are hallmarks of Dravidian temple architecture.


**8. With reference to the Chandravalli Cave Complex in Karnataka, consider the following statements:**

1. The cave complex primarily dates back to the medieval period, showcasing the architectural styles and religious practices of the Vijayanagara Empire.
2. The complex contains chambers with various functions, including a place of worship, living quarters, and possibly an educational space, suggesting its multi-faceted use.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Chandravalli Cave Complex has evidence from the Vijayanagara period, its origins trace back to much earlier prehistoric times, with evidence of Iron Age habitation.  The statement incorrectly limits the complex's historical scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the chambers within the complex accurately reflects the diverse functions they served, possibly including a place of worship, living areas, and even an educational or monastic space.


**9. With reference to the recently granted Classical Language status, consider the following statements:**

1. The Union Cabinet's decision to grant Classical Language status to Marathi, Pali, Prakrit, Assamese, and Bengali reflects a comprehensive and inclusive approach to recognizing India's linguistic diversity.
2. The criteria for granting Classical Language status primarily focus on the antiquity of the language and the richness of its ancient literature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The decision to grant Classical Language status to the mentioned languages reflects an attempt to acknowledge the diverse linguistic heritage of India.

Statement 2 is correct. While other factors might be considered, the primary criteria for granting Classical Language status indeed revolve around the age and the substantial body of ancient literature associated with the language.



**10. With reference to the Kesariya Stupa in Bihar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kesariya Stupa is significant for its association with the Buddha's birth and his attainment of enlightenment.
2.  The stupa's construction involved primarily mud bricks and lime mortar, making it remarkably durable and tall, exceeding the height of the Borobudur Stupa in Java.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kesariya Stupa is associated with significant events in the Buddha's life but not his birth or enlightenment. Those events are linked to other locations.  This creates a plausible distractor by linking the stupa to commonly known events in the Buddha's life.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the stupa's construction materials and its remarkable height accurately reflects its key features. The comparison to Borobudur further emphasizes its impressive scale.


**11. With reference to the Sri Madhava Perumal Temple and its associated findings, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's inscriptions revealed an ancient trade route connecting the Kongu region with northern Karnataka and Kerala, primarily used for the transport of spices and textiles.
2.  The Sri Madhava Perumal Temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, was constructed in the 14th century CE during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Inscriptions found at the temple have indeed revealed an ancient trade route. The statement correctly identifies the regions connected and the historical period.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the temple was constructed in the 14th century, it was built during the rule of Veera Siddha Keththaya Dhandanayaka, not under the Vijayanagara Empire.  The statement incorrectly attributes the temple's construction to a specific empire.  The temple's deity is also Shiva, not Vishnu, further enhancing the distractor's effectiveness.


**12. With reference to the rock art found near the Zarme River, consider the following statements:**

1. The rock carvings, etched into meta basalt rock, primarily depict scenes of human interaction, warfare, and hunting, reflecting the daily life of the region's inhabitants.
2.  The presence of cupules (hemispherical cup-shaped depressions) in the rock art suggests a possible ritualistic or symbolic significance beyond purely representational purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the rock carvings is inaccurate. The carvings primarily depict animals, not humans engaged in hunting or warfare. This misrepresentation of the art's content makes it a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The presence of cupules in rock art is often interpreted as having ritualistic or symbolic meaning, adding a layer of complexity beyond simple depiction.


**13. With reference to the Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bavikonda Monastery is part of the Buddhist circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme and showcases a blend of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist architectural styles.
2. The monastery, named "Bavikonda" meaning "hill of wells," was primarily constructed during the Gupta period and served as a significant center for Mahayana Buddhist learning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bavikonda's inclusion in the Buddhist circuit and its Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist architecture are accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The monastery's construction dates back to the 3rd century BCE, not the Gupta period, and it primarily reflects Theravada, not Mahayana, Buddhist traditions.  The statement misrepresents both the historical period and the religious affiliation of the monastery.



**14. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty and its cultural legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Dynasty, established by Sukaphaa, was characterized by a centralized, autocratic rule with absolute power vested in the king.
2. The Ahoms adopted and patronized Shaivism and the Shakti movement, building and renovating numerous temples across Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ahom kings held significant power, their rule was not entirely autocratic. The Patra Mantris (council of ministers) played a crucial role in governance, and there were periods without a king.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of the Ahom political system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Ahoms' adoption and patronage of Shaivism and the Shakti movement are well-documented, and they are credited with the construction and renovation of many temples.


**15. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut) and its historical significance, consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, located on the Malabar Coast, was ruled by the Cholas during the medieval period, and its strategic location facilitated extensive trade in spices with various foreign powers.
2. The term "calico," a fine hand-woven cotton cloth, is believed to have originated from Kozhikode, highlighting the city's prominence in textile production and trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode was ruled by the Zamorins (Samoothiris), not the Cholas, during the medieval period. The statement misidentifies the ruling dynasty.

Statement 2 is correct. The etymology of "calico" is indeed linked to Calicut (Kozhikode), reflecting the city's historical role in cotton textile production and trade.


**1. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings held absolute power, unconstrained by any council or ministerial body.
2. The Ahom dynasty's cultural influence extended significantly to the adoption of Vaishnavism throughout Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Ahom dynasty was a monarchy, power wasn't solely vested in the king.  A powerful Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris) significantly influenced the king's decisions and appointments.  A king's appointment itself required their concurrence. There were even periods in the 14th century when there was no king due to a lack of suitable candidates approved by this council. This demonstrates a system of checks and balances, not absolute monarchy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ahoms, despite their origins, embraced and patronized both Shaivism and the Shakti movement, leading to the construction and support of numerous temples across Assam. The Kamakhya Devi temple, a significant Shakti shrine, is a prime example of this patronage.  Their cultural assimilation and religious syncretism show a clear influence beyond a simple adoption of Vaishnavism. The statement, while not entirely inaccurate, simplifies a complex religious landscape.


**2. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is uniquely situated at the confluence of seven rivers, a feature that contributes to its annual submergence.
2. All Sangameshwar temples in India are dedicated to Lord Vishnu and are architecturally consistent with the Dravidian style.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Sangameshwar temple in Nandyal is indeed located at the confluence of the Krishna River and several tributaries (Bhavansi, Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi, and Malapaharini).  This confluence is a key element of its identity and the reason for its annual submergence due to the Srisailam dam's backwaters. The number of tributaries, while potentially slightly different depending on the interpretation of "tributaries", doesn't invalidate the core truth of the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While many Sangameshwar temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva,  not all are.  The architectural styles also vary across different locations.  The mention of a consistent Dravidian style is an oversimplification.  For example, the Sangameshwar temple at Pattadakal (part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site) would not be solely described as Dravidian. The statement's sweeping generalization is factually flawed.


**3. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya, consider the following statements:**

1. The present Mahabodhi Temple structure was constructed during the 3rd century BCE by Emperor Ashoka, coinciding with the end of the first Rainy Retreat.
2.  The Mahabodhi Temple complex features only one significant sacred site, the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Emperor Ashoka did mark the site where Buddha attained enlightenment with a pillar, the *present* Mahabodhi Temple structure dates from the 5th-6th centuries CE, not the 3rd century BCE.  The coincidence with the end of the first Rainy Retreat and Pavāraṇā festival is also a separate event not directly linked to the construction of the present temple.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex encompasses several sacred sites beyond the Bodhi tree.  These include the Vajrasana (Diamond Throne), the Animeshlochan Chaitya, Ratnachakrama,  Ajapala Nigrodh Tree, a Lotus Pond, and the Rajyatana Tree.  The statement's simplification ignores the complex layering of sacred significance within the complex.


**4. With reference to Megalithic Burials, consider the following statements:**

1. Megalithic burial practices are exclusively associated with the Iron Age and are not found in earlier periods.
2.  Hire Benkal, a megalithic site in Karnataka, is currently inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While megalithic burials are strongly associated with the Iron Age, their origins extend back to the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period.  Examples like urn burials from Inamgaon (Maharashtra) demonstrate this earlier presence. The statement incorrectly limits the temporal scope of megalithic burial traditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Hire Benkal is *under consideration* for the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage sites.  It is not currently inscribed on the official list.  The statement conflates the status of the site, implying a confirmed inscription when it's only a potential future designation.


**5. With reference to the  World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative focuses exclusively on the transhumance practices of nomadic pastoralist communities in the Himalayas.
2.  The initiative is solely led by UNESCO and is not supported by any other international organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initiative recognizes the importance of Himalayan transhumance (involving communities like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas), it's not limited to this region.  The text explicitly mentions the practice's prevalence in other parts of India (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh) and globally (with examples from Europe cited). The statement's geographic limitation is too narrow.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The initiative is led by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and supported by Azerbaijan.  UNESCO's involvement is not explicitly mentioned in this context, although their recognition of transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages is a related but distinct matter. The statement incorrectly describes the leadership and partnerships involved.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval conquests extended to the Maldives and resulted in the annexation of a significant portion of Sri Lanka.
2. Rajendra I's naval campaign against the Sailendra Empire led to the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, establishing Chola dominance in the Bay of Bengal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola influence through naval expeditions, conquering parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. His aggressive naval policy transformed the Bay of Bengal into a Chola lake, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.  Rajendra I built upon this foundation, launching a major naval campaign against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Rajendra I, not Rajaraja I, is primarily associated with the extensive conquests in Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. However, Rajaraja I laid the groundwork for this expansion through his naval victories and establishment of a powerful navy.  The statement doesn't explicitly mention Rajendra I, making (a) incorrect.  Statement 2 correctly highlights Nagapattinam's crucial role as a major trading hub facilitated by the Chola navy's control over the Bay of Bengal, enabling flourishing trade with Southeast Asia.

The process involves evaluating whether the monument retains its significance and whether it can be effectively protected and maintained.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does not explicitly define "missing monuments" as a specific category. The term "untraceable" is used instead, and the decision to delist is based on a lack of national importance, not solely on the monument being untraceable. The term "missing monuments" originated from the CAG Audit report and is not a formal legal category within the AMASR Act.  Therefore, only statement 1 correctly reflects the delisting process under the ASI.

2.  Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819) led to the signing of the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, fundamentally altering the relationship between the Holkars and the British East India Company.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's history.  Statement 1 correctly points out the dynasty's role in developing Maheswar and Indore into important commercial hubs.  The promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry, culminating in a GI tag for its sarees, further underscores the dynasty's contribution to economic growth. Statement 2 is also accurate; Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War did indeed lead to the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818, marking a significant shift in the power dynamics between the Holkar rulers and the British. This treaty fundamentally altered the Holkar's autonomy and established British dominance in the region. Therefore, both statements reflect accurate historical facts about the Holkar Dynasty.


**6. With reference to the  Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nalanda University, established by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, was renowned for its diverse curriculum, encompassing subjects such as Vedas, Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, and astronomy, and its rigorous merit-based admissions process.
2.  The university's extensive library, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," housed an estimated nine million books across nine floors, showcasing the institution's vast collection of knowledge.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key features of the ancient Nalanda University.  Its founder, Kumargupta I, established it as a premier center of learning. The curriculum was indeed diverse, covering a wide range of subjects, including those mentioned.  The emphasis on merit-based admissions further highlights the university's commitment to academic excellence. Statement 2, while captivating, is likely an exaggeration of the actual number of books in the library. While the library was undoubtedly vast and significant, the claim of nine million books across nine floors lacks definitive historical evidence and is considered an overestimation by many scholars.  Therefore, only statement 1 provides a historically accurate account of the ancient Nalanda University.


**7. With reference to  Sri Vijaya Puram (formerly Port Blair), consider the following statements:**

1. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram signifies the victory of the Indian freedom movement and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' unique contribution to India's struggle for independence.
2. The strategic location of Sri Vijaya Puram, historically serving as a naval base for the Chola Empire, highlights its contemporary geopolitical importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the significance behind the renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram. Statement 1 correctly emphasizes the symbolic importance of the new name, connecting it to the Indian freedom struggle and acknowledging the islands' role in this historical context.  The choice of the name also reflects the historical importance of the location as the site where Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose unfurled the Indian flag.  Statement 2 correctly points out the strategic location of Sri Vijaya Puram, highlighting its historical significance as a naval base for the Chola Empire and its continuing relevance in contemporary geopolitics.  The location's strategic importance is a factor in the decision to rename the city, signifying a break from colonial legacy and an assertion of India's sovereignty.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the rationale and implications of the renaming.


**8. With reference to the  Supreme Court's new flag, insignia, and Lady Justice statue, consider the following statements:**

1. The unveiling of the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court symbolizes the evolution of judicial ideals, particularly the emphasis on impartiality, which emerged during the Renaissance period with the addition of the blindfold.
2. The origin of the Lady Justice imagery can be traced back to Greek and Roman mythology, with the Roman Emperor Augustus introducing the worship of Justice in the form of the goddess Justitia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of the Lady Justice symbolism and its historical context.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the evolution of the Lady Justice imagery, particularly the addition of the blindfold during the Renaissance as a symbol of impartiality. The blindfold represents the unbiased nature of justice, devoid of external influences or favoritism. This element reflects the ongoing striving for fairness and equity within the judicial system.  Statement 2 correctly traces the origins of the Lady Justice figure to Greco-Roman mythology, noting the role of Roman Emperor Augustus in promoting the worship of Justice as the goddess Justitia.  This historical background shows the long-standing association of Justice with divine attributes and the enduring relevance of this symbolism in legal systems.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate information regarding the Lady Justice statue and its historical and symbolic significance.


**9. With reference to the  Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative primarily focuses on training women and youth to develop new tourism-related products and experiences, such as food tours and craft tours, thereby promoting entrepreneurship and community participation in the tourism sector.
2. The aim of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is to improve the overall tourist experience by providing tourism-related training and awareness to local communities, transforming them into welcoming and knowledgeable ambassadors for their destinations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the objectives and strategies of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative. Statement 1 accurately highlights a key focus of the initiative: empowering women and youth through training to develop and offer unique tourism-related products and experiences. This strategy aims to foster local entrepreneurship and encourage community involvement in the tourism sector, leading to more sustainable and inclusive tourism practices. Statement 2 also correctly identifies the initiative's primary aim: to enhance the overall tourist experience by training and educating local communities to become welcoming and informed ambassadors for their regions. This approach aims to create a more positive and engaging tourist experience, promoting responsible tourism practices and fostering a sense of pride and ownership within local communities. Therefore, both statements accurately capture the essence of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative.


**10. With reference to  Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai is solely responsible for granting GI tags to products from various states across India.
2.  Geographical Indication tags protect and promote products linked to specific geographical origins, highlighting their unique qualities and enhancing their market value.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While the Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai plays a crucial role, it's not the *sole* authority for granting GI tags nationwide.  The process involves multiple agencies and stakeholders at different levels.  Statement 2 accurately defines the purpose of GI tags: to protect and promote products associated with specific geographical areas, emphasizing their unique characteristics and boosting their market value.  GI tags provide legal protection against unauthorized use of the product name and origin, safeguarding the reputation and economic benefits associated with those products. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**1. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom kings held absolute power, with minimal influence from a council of ministers.
2. The Ahom Dynasty's downfall was primarily caused by internal conflicts and succession disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Ahom kings were monarchs, their power was significantly checked by the *Patra Mantris*, a powerful council of ministers.  The king's appointment itself required the council's concurrence, highlighting a system of shared power, not absolute monarchy.  The text explicitly states that "Power heavily vested in the Council of Ministry despite being a monarchy."  This demonstrates a crucial limitation on the king's authority.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Ahom Dynasty's downfall was primarily attributed to the Burmese invasion of Assam and subsequent annexation by the British East India Company following the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826. While internal conflicts might have weakened the kingdom, they were not the primary cause of its demise. The external pressures from the Burmese and later the British proved decisive.  The text clearly states that the dynasty "Ended with the Burmese invasion of Assam and the subsequent annexation by the British East India Company."  This directly contradicts the assertion of internal conflicts as the primary cause of the dynasty's fall.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, a 17th-century epic poem in Sanskrit, is included in the register.
2. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register exclusively features works from the Asia-Pacific region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ramcharitmanas, while indeed included in the register, was written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit, in the 16th century, not the 17th. The subtle but significant difference in language and century highlights the importance of precise factual recall in this question.  The detailed description in the provided text clarifies the language and century of composition.


Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the register includes 17 other works "from the region," confirming its regional focus on Asia-Pacific works.  This underscores the geographical limitation of the register.


**3. With reference to the Sangameswar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2.  There is only one Sangameswar Temple in India, located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu. This highlights the importance of correctly identifying the deity associated with the specific temple.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly mentions other Sangameswar Temples located in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.  The mention of multiple locations directly refutes the claim of a single temple in India. The inclusion of these additional locations serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge beyond basic recall.


**4. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton is a genetically modified variety of cotton, enhancing its yield and quality.
2. The Cotton Corporation of India is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text does not indicate that Kasturi Cotton is genetically modified.  It emphasizes the premium quality and traceability, achieved through blockchain technology, not genetic modification.  The absence of mention regarding genetic modification is a key element in determining the correctness of this statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is involved in the initiative, the text clearly states that the implementing agency is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL).  This points to a crucial detail that distinguishes the roles of different organizations within the initiative.  This demonstrates the need for precise understanding of the agencies involved.


**5. With reference to the  Kozhikode's recognition as India's first UNESCO ‘City of Literature’, consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, historically known as Calicut, is situated on the Coromandel Coast.
2.  The term "calico," referring to a fine cotton cloth, is believed to have originated from Kozhikode.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode (Calicut) is located on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast.  This demonstrates the need for precise geographical knowledge. The confusion between Malabar and Coromandel coasts is a common distractor, testing the candidate's familiarity with Indian geography.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the belief that the term "calico" originated from Calicut (Kozhikode), highlighting the city's historical connection to the textile trade.  This demonstrates a direct link between the city's history and the etymology of a commonly used word.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the  Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum is located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
2. The museum features a Miyawaki forest, one of the world's largest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The museum is situated in Bhuj, Gujarat, not Ahmedabad.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific locations within Gujarat.  The difference between Bhuj and Ahmedabad is a deliberate distractor, emphasizing the importance of precise location details.

Statement 2 is correct. The text specifically mentions that the museum houses one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests. This highlights a unique feature of the museum, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific environmental initiatives.


**7. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Holkar Dynasty was a prominent member of the Rajput Confederacy.
2.  Malhar Rao Holkar II played a significant role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Holkar Dynasty was part of the Maratha Confederacy, not the Rajput Confederacy.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the different political entities in 18th and 19th-century India.  The distinction between Maratha and Rajput is a crucial point.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Malhar Rao Holkar II played a pivotal role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific historical figures and their roles in major conflicts.  The mention of the treaty signed after his defeat further strengthens the statement's accuracy.


**8. With reference to  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

1. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was primarily known for his contributions to the development of Kolkata.
2. He donated his family's land for the establishment of schools, particularly emphasizing girls' education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's significant contributions were focused on the development of Mumbai (Bombay), not Kolkata.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific historical figures and their geographical association.  The confusion between Mumbai and Kolkata is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions his donation of family land for schools, with a specific emphasis on girls' education.  This highlights his philanthropic work and commitment to education.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree.
2. The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observed IAD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka to Sankassiya, not his attainment of enlightenment.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific events in Buddhism. The confusion between two significant events in Buddha's life is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states the Ministry of Culture's involvement in observing IAD in conjunction with the IBC.  This tests the candidate's awareness of contemporary events related to Buddhist celebrations in India.


**10. With reference to  Transhumance in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is primarily practiced in the coastal regions of India.
2. The Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are nomadic tribes known for their transhumance practices in the Himalayas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance in India is predominantly practiced in the Himalayan regions and certain plains, not coastal areas.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the geographical distribution of this traditional practice.  The contrast between Himalayan and coastal regions is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly names these tribes as examples of communities engaging in transhumance in the Himalayas.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific tribal groups and their traditional practices.  The detailed description of their livestock rearing and seasonal movements strengthens the accuracy of the statement.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval power, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval dominance extended to the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai, facilitating trade expansion under their "Look West" policy.
2.  Rajendra I's conquests included Sri Lanka, parts of the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval power and trade, the text mentions the destruction of the *Chera*, not the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.  Furthermore, the Chola's maritime expansion was associated with a "Look East" policy, focusing on Southeast Asia, not a "Look West" policy.  The "Look East" policy facilitated flourishing trade with countries in Southeast Asia.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that Rajendra I's naval conquests included Sri Lanka (resulting in its annexation as a Chola province), regions of the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra. His naval prowess transformed the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake," highlighting Chola dominance of the region.  This statement accurately reflects the historical record of Rajendra I's military achievements and their impact on maritime control.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative:**

1.  The initiative, spearheaded by the Ministry of Commerce, utilizes blockchain technology to ensure 100% traceability and certification of Indian cotton.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency, aiming to enhance global competitiveness and create a sustainable ecosystem for Indian cotton.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initiative is indeed a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry, aiming for 100% traceability and certification using blockchain technology. However, the statement incorrectly attributes the initiative to the Ministry of Commerce.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly identifies the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) as the implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  The aim, as stated in the text, is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton and create a sustainable ecosystem. This accurately reflects the initiative's objectives and implementation structure.



**3. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "missing monuments" as those that are untraceable and lack national importance, leading to their delisting by the ASI.
2. Section 35 of the AMASR Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed to have ceased to be of national importance, allowing for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that there is no term "missing monuments" in the AMASR Act. The term originated from a CAG audit report. The delisting is based on the assessment of a lack of national importance, not a predefined category of "missing monuments."

Statement 2 is correct. Section 35 of the AMASR Act does empower the Central Government to delist monuments that are no longer considered to be of national importance.  The consequence of delisting, as mentioned, is that regular construction and urbanization activities can then take place in the area. This accurately reflects the legal provision within the AMASR Act.



**4. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in the 7th century CE by Kumargupta I, it was a center of learning until its destruction in 1100 CE by Bakhtiyar Khalji.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions Nalanda's founding in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I and its destruction in 1205 CE by Bakhtiyar Khalji under Qutbuddin Aibak, the provided date of 7th century for its establishment and 1100 CE for its destruction are inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the breadth of subjects taught at Nalanda University, including a range of religious studies (Vedas and various Buddhist schools), as well as secular disciplines like fine arts, medicine, astronomy, and even war strategy. This reflects the diverse and advanced nature of the university's curriculum.


**5. With reference to the  Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text indicates that the Holkar Dynasty, part of the Maratha Confederacy, fostered the economic growth of Maheswar and Indore.  The promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry is also mentioned, highlighting their contribution to trade and commerce.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that the Holkar Dynasty played a pivotal role in the *Third*, not the Second, Anglo-Maratha War.  The Treaty of Mandsaur was indeed signed in 1818 following Malhar Rao II's defeat at Mahidpur, but this was a consequence of the Third, not the Second, Anglo-Maratha War.


**6. With reference to the  contributions of Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 significantly contributed to the global understanding of Vedanta philosophy, particularly the Advaita system.
2.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, primarily focusing on educational initiatives like establishing schools and colleges, while largely neglecting social service and healthcare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text highlights Swami Vivekananda's impactful address at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago.  His presentation significantly promoted Vedanta philosophy globally. The text also mentions his contributions to the understanding of the Advaita system, aligning with the statement's claim.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the text does mention the establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, it explicitly states that the mission engages in various forms of social service, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges. The statement inaccurately portrays the Mission's activities as primarily educational and neglecting other social service aspects.


**7. With reference to  Ratan Naval Tata's accomplishments, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under his leadership, the Tata Group's revenue increased significantly, becoming one of India's largest employers, while simultaneously launching the Tata Indica, a pioneering budget-friendly car.
2.  Tata Motors received recognition from PETA India for its commitment to sustainable practices, specifically for using vegan interiors in the AVINYA Concept car.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text accurately mentions the significant revenue growth of the Tata Group under Ratan Tata's leadership and its status as a major employer in India, it incorrectly names the budget-friendly car as the Tata Indica.  The text actually mentions the launch of the Tata Nano.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Tata Motors received the PETA India Cow-Friendly Future Award for employing vegan interiors in its AVINYA Concept car. This accurately reflects the award and the reason behind it, demonstrating Tata Motors' commitment to sustainable practices.


**8. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India, based on recommendations from a committee chaired by the Prime Minister, to individuals for exceptional contributions in any field.
2.  Recipients of the Bharat Ratna receive a monetary grant in addition to a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms that the Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President of India to individuals for outstanding service in any field. While it states that recommendations are made by the Prime Minister, it does not mention a specific committee chaired by the Prime Minister. However, the core information regarding the President's role and the award criteria is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Bharat Ratna award does *not* come with any monetary grant. The statement incorrectly adds the detail of a monetary component to the award.  The description of the Sanad and medallion is accurate, but the addition of a monetary grant makes the statement false.


**1. With reference to the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on a report submitted by the Ministry of Culture, assessing the monument's national importance and traceability.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments" and outlines the procedure for managing such monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's decision to delist centrally protected monuments is indeed based on a report from the Ministry of Culture.  This report assesses factors such as the monument's national importance and its traceability.  If a monument is deemed "untraceable" and lacking national significance, it may be considered for delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.  This process highlights the government's role in determining the preservation status of historical sites.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does *not* explicitly define the term "Missing Monuments." This term emerged from usage by the CAG audit team in their reports. The Act focuses on the declaration of national importance and the subsequent preservation or delisting of monuments based on their historical and archaeological significance.  The absence of a formal definition for "Missing Monuments" within the Act underscores the evolving nature of heritage management and the challenges in dealing with lost or undocumented sites.  The difference between the formal legal framework and the informal terminology used in audits highlights the complexities of heritage preservation.


**2. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The establishment of the new Nalanda University campus was primarily driven by the conclusions of the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2006.
2.  The ancient Nalanda University's library, known as "Dharma Gunj," housed over nine million books spanning nine floors, and its curriculum encompassed subjects like Vedas, Theravada Buddhism, and war strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the decision to establish Nalanda University did have its roots in discussions at East Asia Summits, it was the *2nd* EAS in the Philippines in 2007, not the first, that laid the groundwork for the university's creation. This shows the evolution of the project over time and international cooperation in reviving this important historical institution.  The precise timeline and origins of the project are crucial for understanding the political and diplomatic context of its creation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of the ancient Nalanda University's library as "Dharma Gunj," its vast collection (over nine million books across nine floors), and the wide range of subjects taught (Vedas, different schools of Buddhism, war strategy, etc.) are accurate reflections of historical accounts. This demonstrates the scope and depth of the ancient university's academic prowess and its significance as a center of learning in ancient India. The details about the library and curriculum offer insight into the intellectual and academic environment of the time.


**3. With reference to the Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court depicts Lady Justice in Western attire, maintaining the traditional blindfold to symbolize impartiality,  but with a sword representing punishment.
2. The decision to replace the traditional Western attire with a saree aims to reflect Indian culture, while the open eyes symbolize that the law is not blind but sees everyone equally, and the sword is replaced by the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new Lady Justice statue significantly departs from the traditional Western depiction.  The Western attire has been replaced with a saree, a key element in the move towards decolonial symbolism.  Crucially, the blindfold has been removed, symbolizing that justice is not blind but rather sees and acknowledges societal complexities.  The sword, a symbol of punishment, has been replaced with the Indian Constitution, highlighting the rule of law and constitutional values as central to the Indian judicial system. The changes reflect a conscious effort to redefine the representation of justice within an Indian context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The replacement of Western attire with a saree, the removal of the blindfold, and the substitution of the sword with the Indian Constitution are all accurate details of the new statue. These changes represent a conscious effort to decolonize the symbolism of justice and to reflect Indian cultural values and the supremacy of the Constitution in the Indian legal system. This demonstrates an evolving understanding of justice and its representation within a nation's legal and cultural context.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  The Vaikom Satyagraha, primarily led by K. Kelappan, focused on securing access to all four roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple for lower-caste individuals.
2. The movement resulted in the immediate and complete removal of caste-based restrictions on temple entry across Travancore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While K. Kelappan was a significant leader of the Vaikom Satyagraha, T.K. Madhavan and K.P. Kesava Menon also played pivotal roles. More importantly, the Satyagraha initially focused on gaining access to *three* of the four roads leading to the temple.  Full access to all four roads was not achieved during the initial phase of the movement.  The incomplete success of the movement highlights the limitations of the Satyagraha approach and its impact on social reforms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha did not lead to the immediate and complete removal of caste-based restrictions on temple entry across Travancore.  The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, which came later, was a landmark achievement but still did not completely erase all caste-based restrictions on temple entry in all parts of Travancore. The gradual nature of social reform is evident in the time lag between the Satyagraha and the ultimate legal changes. The incomplete and delayed success underscores the complex and protracted nature of social change.


**5. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand utilizes blockchain technology to ensure 100% traceability and certification of premium Indian cotton.
2.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, with no involvement from other organizations or ministries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative indeed leverages blockchain technology to provide complete traceability and certification for its premium Indian cotton. This technological approach is crucial for enhancing the brand's credibility and its global competitiveness.  The use of blockchain showcases the integration of technology in promoting sustainable and ethical sourcing in the textile industry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While TEXPROCIL plays a significant role as the implementing agency, the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint venture involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry itself.  The collaborative nature of the initiative highlights the multi-stakeholder approach needed for successful implementation and the importance of industry-government partnerships in promoting Indian cotton. The involvement of multiple agencies demonstrates the complexity of initiatives aimed at boosting the competitiveness of Indian products in the global market.


**6. With reference to the Bharat Ratna Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharat Ratna award is conferred posthumously only in exceptional circumstances, with a preference for awarding it to living individuals for their contributions.
2.  The design of the Bharat Ratna medal features a peepal leaf shape, with "Bharat Ratna" inscribed in Devanagari script beneath a sunburst figure, and the reverse side features "Satyameva Jayate" in Devanagari script under the state emblem.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the Bharat Ratna can be awarded posthumously, it's generally preferred to honor recipients while they are alive.  The exceptions highlight the extraordinary nature of certain achievements and the recognition given to individuals whose contributions are deemed exceptionally significant even after their passing.  The criteria for posthumous awards reflect the balance between honoring immediate contributions and recognizing lasting legacies.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Bharat Ratna medal's design—peepal leaf shape, Devanagari script for "Bharat Ratna," sunburst figure, and "Satyameva Jayate" on the reverse—is accurate.  The design elements reflect India's cultural and philosophical heritage, conveying the significance and solemnity of the award. The specific details of the medal's design emphasize the attention to detail and symbolism in creating a national award of high prestige.


**1. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Padma Awards are conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases, and they are not considered titles.
2.  The Padma Vibhushan is awarded for distinguished service of a high order, while the Padma Shri recognizes exceptional and distinguished service.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While Padma Awards are typically not given posthumously, the government may make exceptions in highly deserving cases.  The statement accurately reflects this nuance.  Furthermore, the awards are explicitly stated not to be titles and cannot be used as prefixes or suffixes to names.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The order of precedence of Padma Awards is Padma Vibhushan (for exceptional and distinguished service), followed by Padma Bhushan (for distinguished service of a high order), and then Padma Shri (for distinguished service). The statement reverses the descriptions of Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan. This reversal is a significant factual error, making the statement incorrect.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the facts concerning the posthumous nature of the award and the correct order of precedence within the Padma Awards system.


**2. With reference to the Anubhav Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anubhav Awards are presented by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
2. These awards are based on write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal, aiming to improve governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.  This is a key factual difference that makes the statement incorrect.  While both departments fall under the larger umbrella of the government, they are distinct entities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Anubhav Awards are indeed based on write-ups (Anubhav write-ups) submitted by retiring central government employees/pensioners sharing their experiences on the Anubhav Portal. The explicit aim is to leverage this accumulated experience to foster better governance and administrative reforms.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1.


**3. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra, instituted in 1952, is the highest peacetime gallantry award.
2.  Ashoka Chakra awards were initially classified into three classes (I, II, and III) and were later renamed in 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest wartime gallantry award, not a peacetime award. It was instituted in 1950, not 1952.  The confusion arises from mixing up the timing and context of the award.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ashoka Chakra awards were initially classified into three classes (I, II, and III) upon their institution in 1952. These were later renamed in 1967 to Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra respectively. This accurately reflects the historical evolution of the award classification. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the nature of the Param Vir Chakra and the timeline of Ashoka Chakra's renaming.


**4. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards were initially called 'State Awards' and are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals since 1973.
2.  The awards are given in four categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, Best Writing in Cinema, and Best Film-Friendly State.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The National Film Awards were indeed initially called 'State Awards' and the Directorate of Film Festivals has administered them since 1973. This reflects the accurate historical and administrative context of the awards.

Statement 2 is also correct. The awards are given in three main categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema. Additionally, the "Most Film Friendly State" award is also presented alongside the other categories, thus making a total of four categories.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accurate information presented in both statements.


**5. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles Award is a monetary grant given annually since 2015 to projects that reflect local heritage and promote social interaction.
2. Projects shortlisted for the award must be innovative, creative, ecologically efficient, and reflect local heritage, but there is no emphasis on social interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prix Versailles Award does *not* come with any monetary grant. This is a crucial detail that negates the entire statement.  While it is given annually since 2015 and showcases projects reflecting local heritage and promoting social interaction, the absence of a monetary component makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the statement correctly identifies the criteria of innovation, creativity, ecological efficiency, and reflection of local heritage, it incorrectly states that there is *no* emphasis on social interaction. The award explicitly considers projects that promote social interaction and participation.  The other options are incorrect because both statements contain factual inaccuracies.


**6. With reference to the Bharat Ratna, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna is awarded by the President based on formal recommendations from a designated committee.
2.  The award can be conferred posthumously, with Sachin Tendulkar being the youngest recipient.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President confers the Bharat Ratna, there are no formal recommendations required; the Prime Minister makes recommendations to the President.  The absence of a formal committee process is a significant factual inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bharat Ratna can be conferred posthumously (a change implemented in 1966), Sachin Tendulkar was not the youngest recipient.  Furthermore, he is not even in the list of the youngest recipients. The statement incorrectly combines two separate facts. The other options are incorrect due to the factual errors present in both statements.


**7.  With reference to the delisting of monuments by the ASI, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASI's decision to delist monuments is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, and the delisting process is governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.
2.  The term "Missing Monuments" is officially recognized within the AMASR Act, 1958, to categorize monuments that are untraceable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's decision to delist centrally protected monuments is indeed based on reports from the Ministry of Culture, and the legal framework for delisting is explicitly provided under Section 35 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is *not* officially recognized within the AMASR Act, 1958.  This term was coined and used by the CAG Audit team in their report, not the act itself. This distinction is important for understanding the official terminology and processes involved in managing protected monuments. The other options are incorrect due to the factual inaccuracy in statement 2.


**8. With reference to Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  The new Nalanda University campus is a "Net Zero Green Campus" located near the ancient ruins and established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010.
2. The ancient Nalanda University, founded in the 5th century CE, primarily focused on Vedic studies and excluded Buddhist philosophies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The new Nalanda University campus is indeed a "Net Zero Green Campus," situated near the ancient Nalanda ruins, and established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010.  This accurately reflects the facts surrounding the establishment and characteristics of the new university.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ancient Nalanda University, while encompassing a wide range of subjects, was a significant center for Buddhist studies (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism), alongside other disciplines like Vedas, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy. The statement wrongly implies a singular focus on Vedic studies and excludes the crucial role of Buddhist philosophies in the university's curriculum. The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 2.


**9. With reference to the Sri Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The agreement, signed in 2019, allows visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, with a provision for Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India without a visa.
2.  Pilgrims using the corridor are required to return to India on the same day, and Pakistan levies a fee of USD 20 per pilgrim per visit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the agreement does allow visa-free travel for Indian pilgrims and OCI cardholders to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Pakistan, it does *not* grant Pakistani Sikhs visa-free access to Dera Baba Nanak in India. They still require an Indian visa.  This is a significant detail that renders the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Pilgrims using the corridor are indeed required to return on the same day, and Pakistan does levy a fee of USD 20 per pilgrim per visit.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1.


**10. With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative empowers all ginners in India to produce the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand, utilizing blockchain technology for traceability and certification.
2. The Cotton Corporation of India is the sole implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative does empower all ginners in India to produce the brand, leveraging blockchain technology for complete traceability and certification of the premium quality cotton. This accurately reflects the program's scope and technological implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cotton Corporation of India is involved, the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the primary implementing agency for the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  Attributing sole implementation to the Cotton Corporation of India is a factual error. The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 2.



**1. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "Missing Monuments" as centrally protected monuments that cannot be located by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
2.  The Act empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed to have ceased to be of national importance, thereby removing ASI protection and maintenance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act, 1958, does not contain the term "Missing Monuments." This term emerged from a CAG audit report referencing monuments that the ASI could not locate.  The act focuses on the preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites of national importance.  The inability to locate a monument does not automatically define its status under the Act.  The Act's provisions deal with preservation, protection, and maintenance, not a formal categorization of "missing" monuments.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly grants the Central Government the power to declare that a protected monument or site has ceased to be of national importance.  This declaration effectively delists the monument, removing it from the purview of ASI's conservation and maintenance efforts.  This allows for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area, provided they do not further damage any remaining historical significance. The power of delisting is a crucial aspect of the Act, reflecting the evolving understanding of national importance and the need for flexibility in managing protected sites.


**2. With reference to the new Lady Justice statue unveiled at the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The statue retains the traditional blindfold, symbolizing impartiality, while incorporating a saree to reflect Indian tradition.
2. The sword has been replaced with a copy of the Indian Constitution, signifying the supremacy of constitutional values over punitive justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key feature of the new statue is the removal of the blindfold, symbolizing that justice is not blind but actively engages with societal complexities. The saree, replacing Western attire, is indeed a significant change reflecting Indian tradition. However, the blindfold's absence directly contradicts the statement's claim. The decision to remove the blindfold is a deliberate move to shift away from the traditional Western representation of Lady Justice, and to reflect a more active and aware judicial system.

Statement 2 is correct.  The replacement of the traditional sword with the Indian Constitution is a powerful symbol.  It emphasizes the constitutional framework as the foundation of Indian jurisprudence and highlights the importance of upholding constitutional values above mere punishment. The change signifies a shift in emphasis from retributive justice to a justice system grounded in the principles of the Constitution, which is considered a foundational aspect of Indian governance.


**3. With reference to the Vaikom Satyagraha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Satyagraha primarily focused on securing the right of entry for all castes into the Guruvayur Temple.
2. E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a significant role, mobilizing volunteers and garnering public support, resulting in his arrest and rigorous imprisonment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha centered on securing the right of entry for lower-caste Hindus into the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple in Travancore, not the Guruvayur Temple. While the movement aimed to address caste-based discrimination in temple entry, it specifically targeted the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple as a focal point for its struggle against exclusion.  The movement's impact extended beyond a single temple, but its immediate focus was clearly the Vaikom temple.

Statement 2 is correct.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was indeed a crucial figure in the Vaikom Satyagraha.  He actively mobilized volunteers, garnered public support through his speeches, and was arrested during the movement. While the extent of his imprisonment is a matter of historical debate,  his significant contribution is widely acknowledged.  His involvement underscores the movement's broader social justice dimensions and its impact on the struggle against caste-based discrimination in India.


**4. With reference to the Bharat Ratna award, consider the following statements:**

1.  The award is exclusively conferred upon Indian citizens for exceptional contributions in various fields.
2. The award comes with a significant monetary grant, in addition to a Sanad (certificate) and medallion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bharat Ratna primarily recognizes exceptional contributions by Indians, it's not exclusively limited to Indian citizens.  The award has been conferred upon notable non-Indians in recognition of their exceptional service to humanity and India.  This demonstrates a broader recognition of exceptional contributions, regardless of nationality, although the majority of recipients have been Indian nationals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does *not* include a monetary grant. It's purely a prestigious honor, consisting of a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion.  The lack of a monetary component emphasizes that the award's primary value is symbolic recognition of exceptional service to the nation.  The focus is on the honor and recognition, not a financial reward.


**5. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The modern Nalanda University was established in response to a proposal made during the first East Asia Summit (EAS).
2. The ancient Nalanda University primarily focused on Buddhist studies, excluding other subjects like medicine, astronomy, and politics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The modern Nalanda University's establishment was proposed at the *second* East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines in 2007, not the first. The decision to revive the ancient university's legacy as a center of learning was a significant outcome of the summit discussions, aiming to foster intellectual cooperation and exchange in the region.  The timeline of the EAS summits is crucial to understanding the origins of the modern university.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University was a comprehensive center of learning offering a diverse range of subjects.  While Buddhist studies were central, it also covered medicine, astronomy, politics, fine arts, and other disciplines.  The university's wide-ranging curriculum reflects its importance as a major intellectual hub, attracting students from across Asia and beyond. The breadth of its curriculum distinguishes it from institutions focused solely on religious studies.


**6. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty, the empire's founders, were succeeded by the Tuluva dynasty, under whom the empire reached its zenith.
2. The empire's political structure relied heavily on the Amara-Nayakas system, where military commanders were granted territories to rule, collecting taxes and retaining a portion of the revenue.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire's chronology accurately reflects the succession of dynasties. The Sangama dynasty laid the foundation, and they were succeeded by the Saluva and then the Tuluva dynasty, under which the empire attained its greatest power and territorial extent. This sequence is crucial for understanding the empire's evolution and the different phases of its development. The Tuluva dynasty is often associated with the empire's peak.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Amara-Nayaka system was a cornerstone of the Vijayanagara Empire's administrative structure. Military commanders were granted territories to govern, collecting taxes and retaining a portion for their maintenance, the upkeep of their forces, and local infrastructure. This decentralized system, while contributing to the empire's strength, also contained inherent vulnerabilities that eventually contributed to its decline.  The system's intricacies are significant for understanding the empire's governance.


**7.  With reference to the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative aims to promote the use of genetically modified cotton to enhance the quality and global competitiveness of Indian cotton.
2. The initiative utilizes blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of Kasturi cotton from farm to market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative does *not* promote genetically modified (GM) cotton.  It focuses on premium quality Indian cotton with a strong emphasis on sustainability and traceability.  The initiative's aim is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through quality, not through the use of GM technology.  This distinction is essential for understanding the initiative's approach to cotton production.

Statement 2 is correct.  Blockchain technology is a central component of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  It is used to create a transparent and secure system to track and certify the cotton, ensuring its authenticity and origin from farm to market. This technology enhances traceability and builds consumer trust, supporting the initiative's objectives of enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian cotton. The use of blockchain is a defining feature of this initiative.


**8. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. The project is primarily focused on promoting traditional Indian art forms and styles, excluding contemporary art.
2. The project is implemented by the National Gallery of Modern Art and Lalit Kala Akademi, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Culture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI actively promotes a diverse range of art forms, including both traditional Indian art and contemporary art.  The project's aim is to democratize art and make it more accessible to the public, encompassing various styles and approaches.  The inclusion of contemporary art alongside traditional forms is a key element of the project's vision.  The project's inclusiveness is crucial to its overall scope.

Statement 2 is correct. Project PARI is indeed implemented by the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) and Lalit Kala Akademi (LKA), an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Culture. This collaboration brings together significant institutions in the field of art, combining their expertise and resources to achieve the project's goals. The involvement of these institutions is a critical aspect of the project's execution and authority.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval conquests extended to the Maldives and resulted in the annexation of a significant portion of Sri Lanka.
2. Rajendra I's reign witnessed the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, effectively establishing Chola dominance in Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval expansion under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola power through naval campaigns.  His conquests included the subjugation of the Chera navy and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka, along with a successful expedition to the Maldives.  These actions established Chola naval supremacy in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean region.  Rajendra I, his successor, continued this aggressive naval policy. He launched a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, conquering territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This marked the peak of Chola naval power and influence, extending their reach far beyond the Indian subcontinent. Therefore, both statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they only partially represent the scope of Chola naval expansion, while (d) is entirely false given the historical evidence.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1.  The practice of Transhumance is primarily confined to the Himalayan region of India, with nomadic tribes like the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas participating in seasonal livestock migration.
2.  UNESCO has recognized the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, highlighting the global significance of transhumance practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but needs clarification. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas amongst the mentioned tribes,  it's not exclusively limited to that region.  The practice also exists in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement overlooks this broader geographical distribution.  Statement 2 is entirely correct. UNESCO did indeed recognize the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, underscoring the global recognition and importance of traditional transhumance practices.  While statement 1 is not entirely false, its incompleteness makes option (c) the best choice because statement 2 is completely accurate and reflects a key aspect of the topic. Options (a) and (b) are only partially correct, while (d) is false.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Tuluva dynasty oversaw the empire's most significant territorial expansion and its apex of power.
2.  The 'Amaranayaka' system involved hereditary land grants to military commanders who collected taxes and maintained irrigation works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements reflect key aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Tuluva dynasty as the period of the empire's greatest power and territorial expansion.  Under rulers like Krishnadevaraya,  the empire reached its zenith, significantly expanding its control. Statement 2 accurately describes the 'Amaranayaka' system, a crucial element of the empire's administrative and military structure.  The Amaranayakas were powerful military commanders who received land grants ('Amaram' and 'Bhandaravada') in return for military service and tax collection.  They retained a portion of the revenue for their personal upkeep and the maintenance of infrastructure, including irrigation works.  This decentralized system contributed both to the empire's strength and, eventually, its internal weaknesses. Hence, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a) and (b) are partially correct, while (d) is entirely incorrect.


**4. With reference to the UNESCO Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Programme maintains only an International Register of significant documentary heritage.
2. Manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. This reflects a tiered system for recognizing and preserving documentary heritage at different levels—global, regional, and national.  Statement 2 is correct. The manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, reflecting their cultural and historical significance.  The inclusion highlights the importance of these Indian literary works within the broader context of Asian and Pacific documentary heritage.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer. Option (a) is false due to the existence of regional and national registers. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is false, and (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.


**5. With reference to the Harappan Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Harappan civilization primarily used dried bricks in their construction, similar to contemporary Egypt.
2.  The Harappan script, written in a boustrophedon style, has been fully deciphered, revealing details about their religious beliefs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Harappan civilization is renowned for its use of standardized burnt bricks, bound with gypsum mortar, a significant advancement over the dried bricks used in contemporary Egypt.  This reflects a sophisticated understanding of construction techniques. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Harappan script, while written in a boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right), remains undeciphered.  This presents a significant challenge to understanding their language, religious practices, and daily life in greater detail.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they incorrectly attribute either one or both statements as true.


**6. With reference to the 2024 T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 T20 World Cup was held in Australia, marking the second time the country hosted the tournament.
2. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, organized the tournament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 T20 World Cup was held in the USA and West Indies, not Australia.  Australia has hosted the Cricket World Cup on multiple occasions but not the 2024 T20 World Cup.  Statement 2 is correct. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, is the global governing body responsible for organizing major international cricket tournaments, including the T20 World Cup.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is false, and (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.


**7. With reference to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project, consider the following statements:**

1. The project primarily involved the construction of a new temple complex, replacing the existing Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple.
2. The project aimed to improve accessibility to the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple and integrate heritage preservation with development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project did not involve replacing the existing Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Instead, it focused on expanding the area around the temple, restoring smaller temples, and improving the overall infrastructure and accessibility to the main temple.  Statement 2 is correct. A core objective of the project was to create an easily accessible pathway connecting the temple to the banks of the Ganga River.  It also integrated heritage preservation through the restoration of smaller temples and the incorporation of traditional elements into the design.  The project aimed for an enhanced visitor experience while boosting tourism and the local economy.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is false, and (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.


**8. With reference to the  Olympic Games, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius – Faster, Higher, Stronger" and was introduced in 1896.
2. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was established in 1983 to handle legal disputes related to the Olympic Games.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but the date is incorrect. The motto "Citius, Altius, Fortius – Faster, Higher, Stronger" is indeed the Olympic motto, but it wasn't introduced in 1896.  It was adopted later.  Statement 2 is entirely correct. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was established in 1983 to handle legal disputes arising from the Olympic Games and other international sporting events.  This reflects the need for a specialized legal body to address the complexities of international sports governance.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy in statement 1, and (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.


**9. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is located at the confluence of five rivers.
2.  The Sangameshwar temple complex is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is located at the confluence of rivers (Krishna and Bhavanasi, along with other tributaries), it is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While some Sangameshwar temples are part of UNESCO World Heritage sites (like the one in Karnataka as part of the Pattadakal group), the specific Nandyal temple is not itself a UNESCO World Heritage site.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they incorrectly attribute either one or both statements as true.


**10. With reference to the  Prix Versailles, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prix Versailles is awarded to architectural projects that showcase environmentally sustainable design principles.
2.  The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru was awarded the UNESCO's Prix Versailles in 2023.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but needs clarification. The Prix Versailles does recognize projects that contribute to a beautiful living environment, but it is not strictly limited to environmentally sustainable design.  It focuses on the aesthetic and architectural qualities of the projects as well. Statement 2 is correct. The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru was indeed awarded the UNESCO's Prix Versailles in 2023, highlighting its architectural merit.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect because statement 1 is not entirely accurate, and (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is true.



**1. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is situated at the confluence of six rivers.
2.  The Chalukya dynasty constructed the Sangameshwar Temple at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, along with five other tributaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  While it is indeed submerged annually, the statement incorrectly specifies the number of rivers involved. The temple's location at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, along with five other tributaries, is a key feature.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the Chalukya dynasty built the Sangameshwar Temple at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, and five other tributaries (Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi, and Malapaharini). This detail accurately reflects the historical and geographical context of the temple.  The name "Sangameswara" itself highlights the significance of this confluence.


**2. With reference to the Ahom Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ahom Dynasty’s administration was characterized by a strong centralized monarchy with limited influence from a council of ministers.
2.  The Ahom Dynasty, descendants of the Tai race, migrated from Yunnan province in China and established their kingdom in Assam, adopting Shaivism and the Shakti movement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ahom Dynasty, while a monarchy, did not have a highly centralized administration. Power was significantly vested in the Council of Ministry (Patra Mantris). A king's appointment required their concurrence, and there were periods without a king due to a lack of suitable candidates. This demonstrates a system of checks and balances that contrasts with a purely centralized monarchy.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly indicates the Ahom Dynasty's origins as descendants of the Tai race migrating from Yunnan province in China. Their adoption of Shaivism and the Shakti movement, evident in the construction and patronage of temples like the Kamakhya Devi temple, is also accurately described.


**3. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire's land administration system primarily relied on a decentralized structure where local chieftains held significant autonomy.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the empire's expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab, subjugation of Orissa, and victories against the Sultan of Bijapur.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Raya (king) held ultimate authority, the Vijayanagara Empire employed the Amara-Nayaka system.  Amara-Nayakas, military commanders, were granted territories to rule, collecting taxes and retaining a portion of the revenue. This decentralized system granted considerable autonomy to these regional rulers, although ultimately answerable to the empire's central authority.  

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage explicitly mentions Krishnadevaraya's significant military successes during his reign.  These included the acquisition of the Raichur doab (the land between the Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers), the subjugation of Orissa, and decisive victories against the Sultan of Bijapur.  These achievements are well-documented in historical accounts and illustrate the empire's expansion under his leadership.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Mahabodhi Temple Complex:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple's architectural style is a unique blend of Dravida and Nagara styles.
2. The Vajrasana, a polished sandstone platform, marks the spot where Buddha attained enlightenment and was originally installed by Emperor Ashoka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Mahabodhi Temple's design is neither purely Dravida nor Nagara.  It describes the temple's unique characteristics, combining elements from both styles but not conforming entirely to either. This highlights the complex evolution of Indian temple architecture and the temple's distinct position within that history.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly identifies the Vajrasana as a polished sandstone platform marking the spot where Buddha meditated and attained enlightenment.  It further specifies that Emperor Ashoka originally installed it, emphasizing the historical significance of this site and its connection to early Buddhist history.


**5. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indus Valley Civilization's economy was primarily agrarian, with limited evidence of extensive trade networks.
2. The Indus script, written in a boustrophedon style, remains undeciphered, and religious practices involved the worship of deities like Pasupati (proto-Shiva) and the Mother Goddess.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While agriculture was crucial, the Indus Valley Civilization possessed extensive trade networks. Evidence suggests internal and foreign trade, utilizing standardized weights and measures. Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as Meluha, mentioning intermediate trading stations like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast), indicating a sophisticated trading system beyond merely agricultural activities.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage correctly describes the Indus script as pictographic and written in a boustrophedon style (alternating right-to-left and left-to-right). Importantly, it accurately points out that this script remains undeciphered.  The description of religious practices, including the worship of Pasupati (proto-Shiva) and the Mother Goddess, is also accurate, reflecting the current understanding of religious aspects of the civilization.


**6. With reference to the Megalithic Culture, consider the following statements:**

1. Megalithic burial sites, primarily associated with the Neolithic period, contain grave goods and pottery reflecting beliefs about death and the afterlife.
2. The Hire Benkal Megalith Site in Karnataka is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The passage accurately describes megalithic burial sites as originating from the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, with an association with iron. The presence of grave goods and pottery illustrates beliefs about death and the afterlife, a significant aspect of understanding this culture's worldview and practices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Hire Benkal Megalith Site is under consideration for the tentative UNESCO list, it is not yet a designated World Heritage Site.  This highlights the difference between a site being considered for recognition and its actual inclusion in the prestigious UNESCO list.  The statement incorrectly assumes current status.


**7. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut), consider the following statements:**

1. Kozhikode, located on the Coromandel Coast, was a significant center for spice trade during the medieval period.
2. The term "calico," referring to a fine hand-woven cotton cloth, is believed to have originated from Kozhikode.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kozhikode is situated on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast.  This geographical detail is crucial for understanding its historical context and trade routes. While it was indeed a major center for spice trade, the incorrect coastal location makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the term "calico," referring to a fine hand-woven cotton cloth, is believed to have been derived from Calicut (Kozhikode).  This linguistic connection provides valuable insight into the city's historical significance in textile production and trade.


**8.  With reference to  Prehistoric Rock Paintings of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Upper Paleolithic period is characterized by naturalistic depictions of animals and humans in vivid colours.
2. The Mesolithic period rock paintings primarily feature human scenes, such as hunting and community dances, with animals depicted in a more stylized manner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the earliest paintings are from the Upper Paleolithic, the description given is more characteristic of the Mesolithic period.  The Upper Paleolithic paintings are described as linear representations in limited colours. The statement incorrectly attributes the vibrant and detailed style to the wrong period.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The description of Mesolithic paintings as primarily human scenes with stylized animals is partially accurate, but the statement reverses the style of depiction.  It’s the animals that are depicted naturalistically, and the humans in a more stylized way.  The order of naturalism and stylization is reversed in the statement.


**1. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality cotton from India with 100% traceability and certification, utilizing blockchain technology for traceability.  The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency.
2. The initiative aims to enhance global competitiveness of Indian cotton and create a sustainable ecosystem by working on the principle of self-regulation, taking complete responsibility for branding, traceability, and certification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect information about Kasturi Cotton Bharat. Statement 1 correctly identifies Kasturi Cotton as a premium Indian cotton with full traceability and certification, leveraging blockchain technology, and names TEXPROCIL as the implementing agency.  Statement 2 is also accurate, highlighting the initiative's goals of enhancing global competitiveness and fostering a sustainable ecosystem through self-regulation and comprehensive responsibility for branding, traceability, and certification.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in either statement.


**2. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI, executed by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, aims to promote art democratization through public installations in urban landscapes, transforming them into accessible galleries.  The first intervention is taking place in Bhopal.
2.  The project involves over 150 visual artists nationwide creating artwork in Delhi, including traditional art forms like Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, Bani Thani Painting, and Alpana art.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Project PARI's aim and executing agencies are correctly described, the location of the first intervention is stated incorrectly as Bhopal. The text clearly states that the first intervention is taking place in Delhi. Statement 2 is entirely correct, accurately describing the project's scope, the number of artists involved, and the inclusion of diverse traditional Indian art forms.


**3. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  Launched by the Ministry of Tourism, this initiative focuses on responsible tourism across 25 tourist destinations in India, aiming to enhance the tourist experience and promote local culture.
2. The initiative primarily involves training local women as "Paryatan Didis" to act as guides and provide information to tourists, promoting women's empowerment within the tourism sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in its number of tourist destinations. The initiative covers 50, not 25, tourist destinations. While the aim to enhance tourist experience and promote local culture is accurate, the inaccurate number makes the statement incorrect. Statement 2 is correct.  The initiative does primarily focus on training local women as "Paryatan Didis," directly addressing women's empowerment within the tourism sector.


**4.  With reference to the Pilgrim Corridor Projects, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Vishnupad Temple corridor project in Gaya, Bihar, and the Mahabodhi Temple corridor project in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, are inspired by the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.  Both projects aim primarily at boosting tourism revenue.
2. The Vishnupad Temple is located on the banks of the Ganges River and is dedicated to Lord Shiva, marked by a footprint believed to be that of Lord Vishnu. The Mahabodhi Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The inspiration from the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor is explicitly mentioned. While boosting tourism is a consequence, the primary aim is broader than just revenue generation; it includes preservation, restoration, and enhanced visitor experience. Statement 2 contains several inaccuracies. The Vishnupad Temple is located on the banks of the Falgu River, not the Ganges, and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, not Shiva.  The information about the Mahabodhi Temple being a UNESCO World Heritage Site is correct.  The combination of inaccuracies makes Statement 2 incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Holkar Dynasty, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty, a part of the Maratha Confederacy, played a significant role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, ultimately signing the Treaty of Mandsaur after being defeated at the Battle of Mahidpur.  Ahilya Bai Holkar is known for her contributions to literature and arts.
2.  Ahilya Bai Holkar's rule saw the rise of Maheswar and Indore as major trading centers, the promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry, and contributions to social development, including women's education and the resistance to practices like Sati.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are largely accurate. Statement 1 correctly places the Holkar Dynasty within the Maratha Confederacy, notes their role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, and the subsequent Treaty of Mandsaur. While Ahilya Bai Holkar's literary and artistic contributions might not be the primary focus of her legacy, they were indeed part of her reign, making the statement not entirely false. Statement 2 accurately describes Ahilya Bai Holkar's economic and social reforms, including the development of Maheswar and Indore, the promotion of Maheswari weaving, and her efforts towards women's education and social reform.


**6. With reference to Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, consider the following statements:**

2.  He served as the first Indian member of the Bombay Legislative Council and the Asiatic Society of Mumbai, significantly influencing freedom fighters like Dadabhai Naoroji and Justice Ranade.  He is described as the "Architect of Modern Mumbai" by Gangadhar Gadgil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While his contributions to Mumbai's infrastructure, philanthropy, and promotion of girls' education are accurate, his birthplace is incorrectly stated as Pune; it was Murbad in Thane district.  His involvement in the first railway line is also an overstatement; he was a committee member, not solely instrumental. Statement 2 is largely correct, accurately highlighting his political contributions, his influence on prominent figures, and the description of him as "Architect of Modern Mumbai".


**7. With reference to Swami Dayanand Saraswati, consider the following statements:**

1.  Born in 1824 in Morvi, Kathiawar (Gujarat), Swami Dayanand Saraswati's original name was Mula Shankara. He is known for his Vedic ideology, denouncing idolatry and advocating a return to Vedic principles, as detailed in his book "Satyartha Prakash". He also established the Arya Samaj.
2.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati's literary works include "Satyartha Prakash" (in Hindi), "Veda Bhasya Bhumika," and "Veda Bhasya" (in Sanskrit).  His philosophy emphasized the infallible authority of the Vedas and advocated for Dharma free from partiality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Swami Dayanand Saraswati's life and philosophy. Statement 1 correctly identifies his birthplace, original name, and key tenets of his Vedic ideology, including the denouncement of idolatry and the emphasis on returning to Vedic principles as expounded in "Satyartha Prakash". Although the Arya Samaj is not directly mentioned in the provided text, it is a well-known fact associated with him. Statement 2 correctly lists his major literary works and accurately describes his emphasis on Vedic authority and his concept of impartial Dharma.


**8. With reference to the Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, launched in 1992, includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana. The register aims to preserve world documentary heritage and enhance public awareness.
2. The register consists of three tiers: International, Regional, and National.  The inclusion of the three Indian literary works was decided at the 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) held in Beijing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. It correctly identifies the three Indian literary works included in the register, the register's aim, and the year the MoW program was launched (although the register itself might not have been launched in 1992, the program was). Statement 2 is incorrect. While the three-tier structure is accurate, the location of the MOWCAP meeting is incorrect; it was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing.  This inaccuracy makes the entire statement incorrect.


**9. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, inaugurated in 2022, commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, which measured 7.9 on the Richter scale and had its epicenter in Bhuj. The museum features a large Miyawaki forest.
2. Located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, the museum is situated near Bhujio Fort, built by Rao Godji in 1723, named after the Bhujang Naag, a snake temple. The museum showcases the impact of the earthquake on Bhuj's infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate. Statement 1 correctly describes the museum's purpose, the year of its inauguration, the magnitude and epicenter of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, and the presence of a large Miyawaki forest.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the museum's location, its proximity to Bhujio Fort, and the fort's historical context. While the museum doesn't explicitly "showcase the impact of the earthquake on Bhuj's infrastructure" in the provided text, this is a reasonable inference given the museum's purpose.


**10. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema, is presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals. The 2022 award was conferred on Mithun Chakraborty.
2.  Instituted in 1969 to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary, the award includes a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize of ₹10 lakhs.  The award is given to recognize contributions to Indian cinema beyond acting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Statement 1 correctly identifies the award's status as India's highest cinematic honor, the awarding body, and the recipient for 2022. Statement 2 correctly notes the year of its institution, the components of the award (medallion, shawl, and cash prize), and the context of its creation.  While the award recognizes broader contributions to Indian cinema, it is primarily known for acknowledging lifetime achievements in acting, making the statement not entirely false.

Statement 1 correctly identifies Kasturi Cotton as a premium Indian cotton with full traceability and certification, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance its global market standing. This traceability and certification are key to building trust and competitiveness in the international market.  Statement 2 is also correct; TEXPROCIL is indeed the designated implementing agency, tasked with overseeing the project's execution and achieving its goals of branding, traceability, certification, and sustainable ecosystem development for Indian cotton.  There's no contradiction or inaccuracy in either statement.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they only partially represent the initiative's features and implementation. Option (d) is wrong as both statements are factually accurate regarding the Kasturi Cotton Bharat program.


**2. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1.  Project PARI, executed by the National Gallery of Modern Art and Lalit Kala Akademi, aims to transform urban landscapes into accessible public art galleries.
2.  The project primarily focuses on showcasing traditional Indian art forms like Thangka painting and Alpana art, while excluding contemporary artistic expressions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Project PARI's core objective and implementing agencies.  The project intends to democratize art by integrating it into public spaces, effectively turning urban areas into accessible art galleries. Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are correctly identified as the executing bodies.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Project PARI does include traditional art forms like Thangka and Alpana, it explicitly aims to incorporate both traditional and modern themes and techniques. The project actively seeks a diverse range of artistic expressions, not limiting itself solely to traditional styles. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the project's scope and artistic inclusivity.


**3. With reference to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Tourism launched the initiative across 100 tourist destinations to promote responsible tourism practices.
2. The initiative primarily focuses on training local women as guides and hospitality staff to enhance the tourism experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Ministry of Tourism did indeed launch the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative to promote responsible tourism, it was implemented across 50, not 100, tourist destinations.  The number of destinations is a key detail. Statement 2 is largely correct. The initiative's primary goal is to empower local communities, particularly women, by training them in tourism-related roles such as guiding and hospitality services. This improves the quality of the tourist experience while fostering local economic growth. Option (a) is incorrect due to the inaccurate number of destinations. Option (c) is incorrect because statement 1 is partially wrong. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is largely correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum does commemorate the 2001 Gujarat earthquake victims and was inaugurated in 2022, the earthquake's magnitude was 7.9, not 7.7, on the Richter scale.  This slight difference in magnitude is significant. Statement 2 is entirely correct. The museum's location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill and its inclusion of one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, a rapid-growth planting technique developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, are both accurate. Option (a) is incorrect because statement 1 contains an inaccurate detail. Option (c) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is entirely correct.

1.  The award, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, carries a cash prize of ₹15 lakhs.
2.  Satyajit Ray was among the recipients of the award, receiving it in 1985, while Amitabh Bachchan received it in 2018.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The cash prize associated with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is currently ₹10 lakhs, not ₹15 lakhs.  This is a crucial factual detail. Statement 2 is correct. Satyajit Ray did receive the award in 1985, and Amitabh Bachchan received it in 2018.  These are well-documented facts. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent either the cash prize amount or the list of recipients.  The question tests knowledge of both the award's details and its notable recipients.


**6. With reference to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Act defines the term "Missing Monuments" to address monuments that have disappeared or cannot be traced.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects a provision within the AMASR Act. The Act does grant the Central Government the authority to delist monuments if they are assessed as no longer possessing national significance.  This delisting allows for the resumption of construction and other activities in the area.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The AMASR Act does not formally define the term "Missing Monuments."  This term emerged later, possibly through usage by auditing bodies, but it's not a legally established term within the Act itself. This demonstrates a need for precise understanding of legal terminology. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the Act's provisions regarding delisting or incorrectly attribute the definition of "Missing Monuments" to the Act.

1.  The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is located near the ancient Nalanda ruins and designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus."
2. The decision to establish Nalanda University originated from the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) held in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the new Nalanda University campus. Its location near the ancient ruins and its design as a "Net Zero Green Campus" are both factual. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The decision to establish Nalanda University stemmed from the 2nd, not the 1st, East Asia Summit (EAS), held in 2007, not 2006. This shows the importance of precise chronological details. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the location and design of the new campus or incorrectly state the origin of the university's establishment.  The question tests knowledge of both the university's current status and its historical context.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mahatma Gandhi supported the Vaikom Satyagraha, it was not solely led by him, and the movement did not achieve complete success in opening all four roads to the temple for all castes. Only three out of the four roads were opened. Statement 2 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha did contribute significantly to legal reforms, culminating in the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, which granted access to temples for lower-caste individuals. This demonstrates the movement's lasting impact. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the extent of the Satyagraha's success or incorrectly link the movement solely to Gandhi's leadership.  The question tests knowledge of both the movement's outcome and its wider significance.


**9. With reference to the Kakori Train Action, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) executed the Kakori Train Action in 1926 to fund revolutionary activities by looting a British train near Lucknow.
2.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Chandrashekhar Azad were among the key figures involved in the action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Kakori Train Action was indeed executed by the HRA in 1925 (not 1926) to fund revolutionary activities, but it occurred near Kakori, Uttar Pradesh, not Lucknow.  The location is a key detail. Statement 2 is largely correct. Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan were indeed key figures. However, Chandrashekhar Azad was not directly involved in the actual robbery but was a significant figure in the HRA.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the year, location, or the list of key figures involved. The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of historical events and their participants.


**10. With reference to the  UNESCO’s Prix Versailles, consider the following statements:**

1. The award recognizes architectural projects that showcase exceptional design and sustainable practices, focusing solely on airport infrastructure.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles award does recognize exceptional architectural design and sustainable practices, it's not limited to airport infrastructure.  It considers a wide range of building types. Statement 2 is correct. Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru was indeed honored with the 2023 UNESCO’s Prix Versailles award. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent either the scope of the award or the recipient of the 2023 award. The question tests knowledge of specific awards and their criteria.


**11. With reference to Rajendra Chola I's reign, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I, not Rajendra Chola I, led a major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
2.  Nagapattinam served as a significant naval base and a key trading center during the Chola empire's reign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. It is Rajendra Chola I, not Rajaraja Chola I, who is credited with the major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, leading to conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This is a crucial distinction in Chola history. Statement 2 is correct. Nagapattinam was indeed a crucial naval base and a major trading center during the Chola Empire's reign, highlighting its strategic and economic importance. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the Chola ruler responsible for the major naval expedition. The question tests knowledge of specific rulers and their accomplishments.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative does aim to protect and promote the traditional practice of seasonal livestock migration, it is supported by Azerbaijan, not France. Statement 2 is entirely correct. The transhumance practice is widespread in the Himalayan region and Indian plains, with nomadic tribes such as Gujars and Gaddis engaging in seasonal livestock migration, primarily rearing sheep and goats.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the supporting country or the prevalence of transhumance in India. The question tests knowledge of specific initiatives and their geographical context.

1.  The civilization's writing system, written in a boustrophedon style, has been fully deciphered, providing extensive insights into their culture and society.
2.  Evidence suggests extensive internal and foreign trade, with the Indus region exporting grain, jewelry, and pottery, and importing copper and precious stones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus Valley Civilization's writing system, while written in a boustrophedon style, remains undeciphered.  This lack of decipherment limits our understanding of their culture and society. Statement 2 is correct. Archaeological evidence strongly supports the existence of extensive internal and foreign trade within the Indus Valley Civilization, with exports including grain, jewelry, and pottery, and imports including copper and precious stones.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the status of the decipherment of the Indus script. The question tests knowledge of the civilization's achievements and limitations.


**14. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMHC, being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, will be entirely funded by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways.
2.  Lothal's historical significance lies in its location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambat, and its discovery of one of the oldest known man-made dry docks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC at Lothal, while being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, is being developed through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, not solely funded by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways.  This detail is crucial. Statement 2 is entirely correct. Lothal's location and the discovery of its ancient man-made dry dock are well-established facts highlighting its historical significance within the Indus Valley Civilization. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the funding mechanism for the NMHC project.  The question tests knowledge of specific infrastructure projects and their funding sources.


**15. With reference to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The corridor project, inspired by similar projects in Gaya and Bodh Gaya, connects the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the river Ganga.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor project does connect the temple to the banks of the Ganga River.  While inspired by similar projects, the statement correctly describes its primary purpose. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The foundation stone for the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor (Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham) was laid in 2019, not 2020. This is a significant chronological detail. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the corridor's connection to the Ganga River or incorrectly state the year the foundation stone was laid. The question tests knowledge of specific infrastructure projects and their timelines.


**16. With reference to the International Yoga Day, consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as International Yoga Day in 2015, based on a resolution proposed by India.
2. Yoga, derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to join," is considered one of the seven schools of Indian philosophy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UN proclaimed June 21st as International Yoga Day in 2014 (not 2015), based on a resolution proposed by India.  This highlights India's role in promoting yoga globally. However, statement 2 is incorrect. Yoga is considered one of the six, not seven, schools of Indian philosophy. The number of schools is a key factual detail.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in either the year of the UN declaration or the number of schools of Indian philosophy. The question tests knowledge of both the historical context of International Yoga Day and the philosophical classification of Yoga.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai and the annexation of northern Sri Lanka.
2. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, transforming the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola lake."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Rajaraja I did annex northern Sri Lanka and conduct significant naval campaigns,  the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy.  The confusion is deliberately introduced to test the candidate's precise knowledge of Chola military history.  The Pandya and Chera were rival kingdoms, and mixing them up is a common error.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's extensive naval expeditions reached the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. His dominance over the Bay of Bengal is accurately described as transforming it into a "Chola lake," highlighting the empire's naval power and control over crucial trade routes.  This statement accurately reflects the scale and impact of Rajendra I's naval achievements.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**2. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The register includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: the Ramcharitmanas, the Panchatantra, and the Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, reflecting India's rich literary heritage.
2. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Beijing, China, finalized the inclusion of these manuscripts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions the inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the UNESCO's MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This highlights the recognition of these significant Indian literary works as part of the world's documentary heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions the 10th MOWCAP meeting, it states that the meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This deliberate alteration of the location tests the candidate's ability to recall precise details. The incorrect location serves as a plausible distractor, making the question more challenging.


**3. With reference to the International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1.  The United Nations proclaimed June 21st (Summer Solstice) as IYD in 2014, upon a proposal by India, to promote the global practice of yoga and raise awareness of its benefits.
2.  The resolution proposing IYD was endorsed by 170 member states of the United Nations, reflecting the widespread recognition of yoga's significance for health and well-being.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text correctly identifies June 21st (Summer Solstice) as the date designated for IYD by the UN in 2014, following India's proposal.  The statement also accurately reflects the intention behind the declaration: promoting global awareness and practice of yoga.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that a record 175 member states endorsed the resolution, not 170. This subtle numerical discrepancy serves as a significant distractor, requiring precise recall of the information.  The difference between 170 and 175 might seem insignificant, but it highlights the importance of accurate factual recall in UPSC-style questions.


**4. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to recognize exceptional literary contributions and is open to writers from all over the world.
2. Ruskin Bond, a prominent Indian writer known for his works like "Vagrants in the Valley" and "The Room on the Roof," was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Akademi, but it is not awarded annually and is not open to writers from all over the world; it's reserved for Indian writers. The text emphasizes that it is reserved for "immortals of literature," suggesting a highly selective and infrequent bestowal.  The description of the award as annual and open to global writers is a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Ruskin Bond received the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, mentioning some of his well-known works. This directly confirms the accuracy of statement 2.


**5. With reference to the  Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 3 of the Act empowers the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to recover any antiquity traced outside India, irrespective of whether it was illegally exported.
2. The National Monuments Authority (NMA), established under the amended Act of 2010, primarily focuses on regulating construction near centrally protected monuments, rather than preventing the illegal export of antiquities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972,  prevents the export of antiquities *outside* India.  The statement incorrectly suggests that the ASI's recovery powers extend to antiquities *already* outside India, irrespective of their legal export status.  This creates a plausible distractor, playing on the general understanding of the Act's purpose.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMA's functions, as described in the text, primarily involve managing areas around protected monuments and granting construction permissions. While indirectly contributing to the preservation of cultural heritage, its main focus is not on preventing the illegal export of antiquities. This is in contrast to the ASI's role, as described (albeit incorrectly) in statement 1.


**6. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The new Nalanda University campus, inaugurated recently, is located near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Rajgir, Bihar, and aims to promote inter-civilisational dialogue.
2. The establishment of Nalanda University was initially proposed at the 3rd East Asia Summit (EAS) held in Singapore in 2008.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the location of the new Nalanda University campus and its objective of fostering inter-civilisational dialogue.  This directly aligns with the information provided.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the decision to establish Nalanda University was made at the *2nd*, not the 3rd, East Asia Summit, held in the Philippines in 2007.  The alteration of the summit number and location serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the university's origins.  The incorrect information makes the statement a plausible but ultimately false option.


**7. With reference to Abhay Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra, a hand gesture symbolizing protection and reassurance, is primarily associated with the fourth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi.
2.  The Abhaya Mudra is depicted in Buddhist art as a posture used by Buddha to calm a raging elephant, demonstrating his control and compassion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Abhaya Mudra symbolizes fearlessness and protection, the text specifically links it to the *fifth* Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not the fourth. This subtle change in the Buddha's number is a crucial distractor, testing the examinee's detailed knowledge of Buddhist iconography.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly describes the Abhaya Mudra's depiction in Buddhist art as a posture used to calm a mad elephant, symbolizing Buddha's power and compassion. This aligns directly with the information provided.


**8. With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) between India and the USA, consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from the USA to India, focusing on archaeological and ethnological materials.
2. The agreement facilitates the swift seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities illegally imported into the USA, strengthening bilateral cooperation on cultural heritage protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPA's objective is to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from *India* to the *USA*, not the other way around.  This reversal of the direction of trafficking is a significant distractor, requiring careful reading and understanding of the agreement's purpose.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the CPA will help in the quick seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities to India.  This highlights the agreement's practical impact on combating the illegal trade of cultural artifacts.  This is a key aspect of the agreement's purpose.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when the Buddha descended from the Trayastrimsa heaven to Sankisa in Uttar Pradesh, marking the end of his three-month retreat (Vassa).
2. The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary Society, observed IAD, also celebrating the recent declaration of Pali as a classical language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes IAD as commemorating Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka (celestial realm,  a slightly different name, a common mistake) to Sankassiya (now Sankisa) in Uttar Pradesh, coinciding with the end of Vassa and the Pavāraṇā festival.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions the Ministry of Culture's observation of IAD in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), not the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary Society.  The substitution of one organization for another is a subtle but important difference, showcasing the need for precise factual recall.  The incorrect organization is a plausible distractor.


**10. With reference to the  Khelo India programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Khelo India programme primarily focuses on identifying and nurturing young athletes at the elite level, providing them with specialized training and resources.
2. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) programme is a component of the Khelo India initiative, targeting school children between the ages of 10 and 19 years for talent identification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Khelo India programme does nurture elite athletes, it also significantly focuses on grassroots level talent identification and development.  The statement's emphasis solely on the elite level is a misleading simplification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The KIRTI programme targets school children aged 9 to 18 years, not 10 to 19 years.  This small alteration in the age range is a deliberate distractor, demanding precise knowledge of the programme's parameters.  The slightly altered age range makes it a plausible but ultimately incorrect option.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's maritime activities, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval expeditions extended to Sri Lanka, resulting in the annexation of its northern parts, and also encompassed a conquest of the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra I's naval campaigns included a significant expedition against the Sailendra Empire, leading to the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, while Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime power under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval dominance, conquering parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  These actions demonstrate his aggressive naval policy and the empire's growing maritime capabilities.  Statement 1 correctly captures this expansion.

Statement 2 is also correct. Rajendra I continued and further expanded upon his father's naval successes. His expedition against the Sailendra Empire, a powerful maritime power controlling parts of Southeast Asia, showcases the Chola's reach and ambition.  The mention of Nagapattinam as a key trading center further reinforces the importance of maritime trade to the Chola economy and its strategic location for regional commerce. Therefore, both statements are historically accurate and reflect the significant naval power and extensive maritime reach of the Chola Empire.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the full extent of the Chola naval activities.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Transhumance, the seasonal movement of livestock, is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region by nomadic tribes like the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, who move their herds to subalpine and alpine pastures during summer and to adjoining plains during winter.
2.  The transhumance system, characterized by seasonal livestock migration, is exclusively confined to the Himalayan region of India, where unique environmental conditions necessitate this practice for pastoral communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes a significant aspect of transhumance in India.  It accurately identifies the Himalayan region as a key area for this practice, highlighting the involvement of specific nomadic tribes and their seasonal movements between higher-altitude pastures and lower-lying plains. The description of the seasonal migration pattern is also accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Himalayan region is a significant area for transhumance in India, the practice is not exclusive to this region. Transhumance also occurs in other parts of India, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  These regions, while possessing different environmental conditions than the Himalayas, still support pastoral communities that engage in seasonal livestock migrations. Therefore, restricting transhumance solely to the Himalayas is an oversimplification and an inaccurate representation of its geographical distribution within India.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: the Ramcharitmanas, the Panchatantra, and the Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2.  The inclusion of these Indian manuscripts was decided at the 11th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  This decision highlights the global recognition of the cultural and historical significance of these Indian literary works.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that the decision was made at the 10th, not the 11th, meeting of the MOWCAP.  While the location (Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia) is correctly stated, the meeting number is inaccurate. This minor factual inaccuracy makes the entire statement incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**4. With reference to India's Maritime Heritage, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) is documented to have maintained maritime trade links with Mesopotamia, while the earliest references to maritime activities are found in the Rigveda.
2. The Satavahana dynasty is credited with being the first native Indian rulers to issue coins featuring inscriptions of ships, while the Gupta dynasty is known for its extensive naval campaigns against Southeast Asian empires.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies key aspects of early Indian maritime history. The IVC's trade links with Mesopotamia demonstrate early maritime capabilities. The Rigveda's references to maritime activities provide further evidence of early seafaring and trade.

Statement 2 contains inaccuracies. While the Satavahana dynasty did indeed issue coins with ship inscriptions, the text does not indicate that they were the *first* native Indian rulers to do so.  Further, the Gupta dynasty is not known for extensive naval campaigns against Southeast Asian empires; the text focuses on the Chola dynasty for such actions.  The statement misattributes these features. Therefore, only Statement 1 provides accurate information regarding India's early maritime heritage.


**5. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMHC, being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, aims to showcase India's rich maritime heritage from ancient times to the present, and includes a world-class Lighthouse Museum and coastal state pavilions.
2. Lothal's historical significance stems from its location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers, near the Gulf of Khambat, as a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), and its feature of the oldest man-made dry-dock (2400 BC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the NMHC at Lothal and its context.  Statement 1 correctly outlines the NMHC's aim, its development under the Sagarmala Programme, and mentions key components of the project (Lighthouse Museum and coastal state pavilions).  This accurately reflects the project's scope and objectives.

Statement 2 also correctly identifies Lothal's significant location and its importance as an IVC city. The mention of the oldest man-made dry-dock (dating back to 2400 BC) accurately reflects Lothal's technological advancements and its significance for understanding ancient maritime technology.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct and provide a comprehensive description of the NMHC at Lothal and its historical background.  All other options are incorrect as they do not account for the accuracy of both statements.

1.  The Holkar dynasty, part of the Maratha Confederacy, played a significant role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1819), with Malhar Rao II's defeat at the Battle of Mahidpur leading to the Treaty of Mandsaur in 1818.
2.  Ahilyabai Holkar's reign was marked by social reforms such as promoting women's education and widow remarriage, while economically, she established Maheswar as a center of trade and commerce, especially known for its Maheswari weaving industry registered under Geographical Indications (GI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect distinct aspects of the Holkar dynasty's history. Statement 1 correctly positions the Holkar dynasty within the Maratha Confederacy and highlights their involvement in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.  The details regarding Malhar Rao II's defeat and the subsequent Treaty of Mandsaur are historically accurate.

Statement 2 correctly attributes several significant contributions to Ahilyabai Holkar's rule. Her social reforms, including the promotion of women's education and widow remarriage, were progressive for their time. Her economic policies, which established Maheswar as a trading center and fostered the Maheswari weaving industry (now a GI product), also demonstrate her effective governance.  Therefore, both statements are accurate and provide a comprehensive overview of the Holkar dynasty's political and socio-economic contributions.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**7. With reference to the  Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vijayanagara Empire, spanning from 1336-1646, witnessed successive dynasties including the Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties, with the Tuluva dynasty marking the empire's zenith.
2.  Under Krishnadevaraya's reign, the empire expanded significantly, encompassing the Raichur doab, subduing Orissa, and inflicting defeats on the Sultan of Bijapur, while the empire's political structure involved Amara-Nayakas who were appointed as military commanders given territories to rule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's history and structure. Statement 1 correctly identifies the successive dynasties that ruled the empire and accurately pinpoints the Tuluva dynasty as the period of its greatest power. This showcases an understanding of the empire's internal political dynamics and its evolution over time.

Statement 2 also accurately describes Krishnadevaraya's reign, highlighting its military successes and territorial expansion.  The description of the Amara-Nayaka system as a key feature of the empire's political structure is also historically accurate, demonstrating an understanding of the empire's decentralized administration.  Therefore, both statements provide accurate and detailed information about the Vijayanagara Empire, making (c) the correct answer.  The other options fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements.


**8. With reference to the Mahabodhi Temple and its features, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mahabodhi Temple, built in the classical Indian temple architecture style, features a curvilinear shikhara (tower) topped by an amalaka and kalasha, with its design uniquely blending aspects of both Dravida and Nagara styles.
2. The temple complex includes significant features such as the Vajrasana (Diamond Throne), the Sacred Bodhi Tree, and other sacred places mentioned by Buddha himself as important for the ‘Dharma Yatra’, including Lumbini, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct regarding the architectural style but inaccurate in its description of the stylistic blend. While the Mahabodhi Temple does indeed exhibit elements of classical Indian temple architecture with a shikhara, amalaka, and kalasha, its design is *not* a blend of Dravida and Nagara styles. The text explicitly states that its design is neither Dravida nor Nagara, possessing a unique character.  This inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is entirely correct.  It accurately identifies the Vajrasana, the Sacred Bodhi Tree, and other sacred sites within the Mahabodhi Temple complex. The mention of the four places significant to Buddha's life (Lumbini, Bodhgaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar) is accurate, although these are not *within* the Mahabodhi Temple complex itself, but rather other locations important to Buddhist pilgrimage. However, the statement correctly identifies the importance of these locations in relation to the temple's significance.   Therefore, only statement 2 is fully accurate.


**9. With reference to Yoga and its historical context, consider the following statements:**

1.  The word "Yoga," derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," signifies the union of mind and body, representing a holistic approach to health and well-being, and is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, the others being Vaishesika, Nyaya, Samkhya, Purva Mimansa, and Vedanta.
2.  Evidence from the Indus Valley Civilization, dating back to 2700 BC, suggests the practice of yoga in ancient India, with systematic references to yoga being found in Patanjali's Yogasutra (2nd century BC) and also referred to in all four Vedas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines yoga's meaning and philosophical context.  It correctly explains the derivation of the word "yoga," its holistic approach, and its place within the six schools of Indian philosophy.  This demonstrates a clear understanding of yoga's core concepts.

Statement 2, while containing some correct information, is ultimately inaccurate. While seals and fossil remains from the Indus Valley Civilization may suggest practices related to yoga, it is an overstatement to claim definitive evidence of yoga's practice at that time.  Furthermore, the assertion that yoga is referred to in all four Vedas requires further substantiation and is not definitively supported by the provided text.  The reference to Patanjali's Yogasutra is correct. Thus, the overall statement contains inaccuracies, making it incorrect.  Only statement 1 is fully accurate.


**10. With reference to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor facilitates pilgrimage to Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib, situated in the Narowal district of Pakistan, approximately 4.5 km from the international border near Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district, Punjab.
2.  India and Pakistan's agreement on the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has recently been extended indefinitely, ensuring uninterrupted pilgrimage access for devotees regardless of any future political changes between the two nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor's purpose and location. It correctly identifies the location of Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan and its proximity to the India-Pakistan border.  This demonstrates a clear understanding of the corridor's geographical context and its significance for Sikh pilgrims.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that the agreement has been extended for five years, not indefinitely.  The assertion of uninterrupted access regardless of future political changes is an overstatement and not explicitly supported by the given information. The limited duration of the extension introduces uncertainty regarding long-term access.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions might touch upon multiple historical periods or themes.  The difficulty level aims to be challenging, requiring precise factual recall and nuanced understanding.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast and suppressing internal rebellions, with limited overseas campaigns.
2.  Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence across the Bay of Bengal and into Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rajaraja I's naval prowess extended beyond the Coromandel Coast.  His campaigns included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, demonstrating a clear expansionist naval policy beyond mere coastal control.  While internal stability was undoubtedly a factor, his naval dominance was crucial for projecting power regionally.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra Chola I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire represents a significant expansion of Chola power into Southeast Asia, particularly the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This conquest established a substantial Chola presence in the region, far exceeding the scope of Rajaraja I's campaigns.  The "Chola Lake" designation for the Bay of Bengal underscores the vast maritime control achieved under Rajendra Chola I.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the practice of transhumance:**

1.  Transhumance is primarily a modern phenomenon driven by agricultural intensification and climate change, largely replacing traditional pastoralism.
2.  In India, transhumance is predominantly associated with Himalayan regions, with limited presence in the plains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Transhumance is a deeply rooted traditional practice dating back centuries, not a modern phenomenon. While climate change and agricultural pressures may be influencing its contemporary dynamics, its origins lie in ancient pastoralist societies' adaptation to seasonal variations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, the practice also exists in various plains regions of India such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement underestimates the geographical spread of this traditional practice.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the register signifies the prioritization of religious texts over secular literary works.
2. The MoW program's primary focus is on digitizing and making accessible only those texts that are critically endangered and on the verge of being lost.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Ramcharitmanas is a religious text, the inclusion of Panchatantra (fables) and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana (a text on poetics) demonstrates a broader scope than just religious texts. The register encompasses diverse literary genres reflecting the richness of the region's documentary heritage.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MoW program aims to preserve and enhance access to significant documentary heritage worldwide, including texts that are not necessarily critically endangered.  While preservation of endangered materials is a key aspect, the program's scope is broader than solely focusing on imminent loss.


**4. With reference to the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMHC's primary objective is to showcase India's maritime history exclusively through the lens of the colonial period, highlighting the impact of European powers on Indian ports.
2.  The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal primarily demonstrates the advanced shipbuilding techniques of the Indus Valley Civilization, surpassing those of contemporary civilizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMHC aims to showcase India's rich maritime heritage from ancient times to the present, not solely focusing on the colonial period.  The Indus Valley Civilization's maritime activities, as evidenced by Lothal, are a crucial part of this broader narrative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the dry dock at Lothal indicates advanced understanding of tides and nautical factors, it's inaccurate to claim that it definitively surpasses the shipbuilding techniques of other contemporary civilizations.  Comparative studies are needed to make such a definitive claim.  The discovery, however, does highlight the sophistication of the Indus Valley Civilization's maritime capabilities.


**5.  With reference to the  Geographical Indications (GI) tags, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geographical Indications Registry primarily focuses on granting GI tags to agricultural products, neglecting other forms of traditional craftsmanship or industrial goods.
2.  The GI tag system in India primarily serves to protect the intellectual property rights of individual artisans and producers, not geographical regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GI tag system in India encompasses a wide range of products beyond agriculture, including handicrafts, industrial goods, and other products intrinsically linked to specific geographical regions.  The system aims to protect the unique qualities associated with a particular place of origin.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GI tag benefits individual producers by associating their products with a specific location, its primary purpose is to protect the reputation and distinctiveness of a geographical region and its associated products. It is a regional protection system, not solely focused on individual producers' intellectual property rights.



**6. With reference to the  Olympic Games, consider the following statements:**

1. The Olympic motto, "Faster, Higher, Stronger," was adopted in ancient Greece and has remained unchanged since the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.
2.  The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was established by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to resolve disputes arising solely from doping violations in the Olympic Games.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While "Faster, Higher, Stronger" is the well-known Olympic motto, it was not adopted in ancient Greece.  It was added in 1924, after the revival of the modern Olympic Games in 1896.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAS's jurisdiction extends beyond doping violations.  It addresses a wide range of disputes related to the Olympic movement, including eligibility issues, contract breaches, and other legal challenges. Its role is broader than solely handling doping cases.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Bengal Gazette:**

1. James Augustus Hicky, the founder of the Bengal Gazette, was a British citizen who aimed to promote pro-British sentiments in colonial India through his publication.
2. The Bengal Gazette's closure was primarily due to its critical reporting on the East India Company's trade practices and financial dealings, rather than criticisms of specific individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. James Augustus Hicky was an Irishman, not a British citizen.  Furthermore, the Bengal Gazette was known for its critical, often adversarial stance towards the British establishment in India, not for promoting pro-British views.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bengal Gazette did criticize the East India Company's practices, its closure was more directly linked to its sharp criticism of Governor-General Warren Hastings and other prominent officials.  The personal attacks on powerful individuals were a significant factor leading to its suppression.


**8. With reference to the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMO awards medals based on a points system, where a perfect score guarantees a gold medal, and the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals is rigidly fixed in advance.
2. The IMO is exclusively open to students from member countries of the United Nations, excluding those from non-member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IMO uses a points system to determine medal winners, a perfect score doesn't automatically guarantee a gold medal.  The number of gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded is not predetermined but depends on the performance of participants each year. The distribution is flexible and based on the scores achieved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IMO's participation is not limited to UN member countries.  Many countries that are not UN members participate regularly in the competition.  Eligibility is primarily based on the invitation and selection processes within participating nations.


**9.  With reference to the world's oldest calendar discovered at Göbekli Tepe, consider the following statements:**

1. The calendar's carvings primarily depict constellations and astrological symbols, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of celestial mechanics in the early Neolithic period.
2.  The calendar's discovery at Göbekli Tepe conclusively proves that the site was a major astronomical observatory, rather than a purely religious or ceremonial center.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the calendar features symbols, they are not exclusively constellations or astrological symbols.  The carvings include V-shaped symbols representing days, animals, and abstract designs, suggesting a broader purpose beyond just astronomical observation.  The interpretation of the symbols is still ongoing and not fully conclusive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The calendar's presence at Göbekli Tepe adds to the evidence of advanced knowledge in the Neolithic era, but it doesn't definitively prove that the site's primary function was as an astronomical observatory.  Göbekli Tepe's purpose was likely multifaceted, encompassing religious, ceremonial, and potentially astronomical functions.  More research is needed to establish its precise role.


**1. With reference to megalithic structures in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic chamber tomb, are typically found fully subterranean.
2.  Megalithic sites in India exclusively serve as burial grounds; no other functions are associated with them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are described as semi-subterranean chamber tombs, meaning they are partially underground, not entirely subterranean.  The text clearly states they are "semi-subterranean." This detail is crucial for understanding their construction and function within the broader megalithic landscape.  A misunderstanding of this could lead to incorrect interpretations of their purpose and construction techniques.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many megalithic sites function as burial grounds, the provided text mentions three basic types of megaliths: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths not connected with burials. This indicates a diversity of functions beyond solely burial practices, challenging the simplistic view presented in statement 2.  The presence of non-burial megaliths suggests a broader range of social, ritualistic, or ceremonial uses, reflecting the complexity of prehistoric societies.


**2. With reference to the Ikshvaku period, consider the following statements:**

1. A significant coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period was recently unearthed at the Bavikonda Monastery site in Andhra Pradesh.
2.  Archaeological findings at Phanigiri, Telangana, suggest a clear distinction between Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist practices, with no evidence of coexistence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that a coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period was discovered at the Phanigiri site in Telangana, not Bavikonda Monastery in Andhra Pradesh.  Confusing these two geographically distinct locations and their associated archaeological finds demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the distribution of Ikshvaku-era artifacts.  Accuracy in geographic location is crucial for understanding the spread of cultures and power dynamics during this historical period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the thoranas (gateways) at Phanigiri show evidence of the coexistence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects.  This detail highlights the complex religious landscape of the region during the Ikshvaku period and challenges the notion of a strict separation between these two branches of Buddhism.  An understanding of religious syncretism and the interplay of different Buddhist traditions is essential for a nuanced interpretation of the archaeological record.


**3. With reference to Buddhist sites in Andhra Pradesh, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bavikonda Monastery, dating back to the 3rd century BCE, is a significant example of Mahayana Buddhist architecture.
2.  The Salihundam site is notable for its role in the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra and other eastern countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that the Bavikonda Monastery is a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist complex, not Mahayana.  This distinction is important for understanding the different schools of Buddhist thought and their architectural expressions.  Confusing these two branches of Buddhism demonstrates a lack of understanding of their distinct theological and philosophical tenets.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions that Salihundam played a crucial role in the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra and other eastern countries.  This highlights the site's significance as a center of Buddhist influence and its connection to broader networks of cultural exchange in Southeast Asia.  Understanding the historical connections between Indian Buddhism and its spread across Asia is crucial for a global perspective on the religion's history.


**4. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajendra I's naval conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but not Sri Lanka.
2. Rajaraja I's naval forces engaged in significant battles, including the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Rajendra I's naval conquests included Sri Lanka (resulting in its annexation as a Chola province) *in addition* to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  The statement incorrectly omits Sri Lanka from his conquests, demonstrating a flawed understanding of the geographical extent of Chola naval power.  A comprehensive understanding of the Chola Empire's reach requires accurate knowledge of the regions under their control.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Rajaraja I's naval expedition and the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai as a key event.  This highlights the importance of naval power in the Chola Empire's military strategy and its impact on regional politics.  Understanding the strategic importance of naval dominance in this historical context is essential for analyzing the rise and expansion of the Chola Empire.


**5. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a practice primarily limited to the Himalayan region of India.
2. In 2023, UNESCO recognized two transhumance traditions – one from 10 European states and another from Switzerland – as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas,  the text also mentions its existence in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  Restricting transhumance to only the Himalayas overlooks its wider geographical distribution within India and demonstrates a limited understanding of its practice.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that two transhumance traditions, one from 10 European states and the other from Switzerland, were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO in 2023. This highlights the global recognition of transhumance as a significant cultural practice and its importance in preserving traditional ways of life.  Understanding UNESCO's role in safeguarding cultural heritage is crucial for appreciating the significance of this recognition.


**6. With reference to the Kalinga Dynasty and its cultural legacy, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kalinga War of 261 BCE, led by Emperor Ashoka, resulted in the complete destruction of the Kalinga Dynasty and its cultural heritage.
2. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty (Meghavahana dynasty according to the text), is known for his patronage of Jainism and the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War significantly impacted the Kalinga Dynasty, it did not result in its complete destruction or the eradication of its cultural heritage.  The text indicates that the Kalinga Dynasty continued to exist after the Mauryan conquest, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between conquest and cultural continuity.  Oversimplifying the consequences of the Kalinga War ignores the complexities of historical interactions between empires and regional powers.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly attributes the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves to King Kharavela of the Kalinga Dynasty (Meghavahana according to the text), highlighting his patronage of Jainism and his contribution to rock-cut cave architecture.  Understanding the cultural patronage of rulers is essential for analyzing the development of art and architecture during this period.  The Hathigumpha inscription further supports Kharavela's role in the caves' construction and his reign.


**7. With reference to the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The temple's architecture is exclusively Dravidian in style.
2.  The Ratna Bhandar, the temple's treasury, was recently reopened after a period of 46 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifically states that the Shree Jagannath Temple's architecture is Kalinga style, a distinct substyle within the Nagara style, and that its design is neither purely Dravidian nor Nagara, having elements of both.  This demonstrates a limited understanding of the temple's unique architectural features, which blend elements of different regional styles.  A thorough analysis of Indian temple architecture requires recognition of the diverse regional styles and their hybrid forms.

1.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the empire's territorial expansion reach its zenith, encompassing the entire Indian subcontinent.
2.  The Vijayanagara Empire's political structure included the Amara-Nayakas, military commanders who were granted territories to govern and collected taxes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Krishnadevaraya's reign was a period of significant expansion for the Vijayanagara Empire, the text does not claim that it encompassed the entire Indian subcontinent.  This statement exaggerates the empire's territorial reach, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about its geographical boundaries.  Understanding the limitations of the empire's power is crucial for a balanced view of its historical influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly describes the Amara-Nayakas as military commanders granted territories to rule, collecting taxes and retaining a portion for their own use and maintenance, including temple and irrigation works.  This highlights the decentralized nature of the empire's administration and the role of regional governors in its functioning.  Understanding the administrative structure of the Vijayanagara Empire is essential for comprehending its political organization and its ability to control a vast territory.


**9. With reference to  the UNESCO's Prix Versailles, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prix Versailles award exclusively recognizes architectural projects in European countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions that the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru, India, received the UNESCO Prix Versailles award, demonstrating that the award is not limited to European countries.  The statement incorrectly restricts the award's scope, showing a misunderstanding of its global reach and the diversity of projects it recognizes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum is mentioned in the text, it is not explicitly linked to the Prix Versailles award.  The text highlights the Kempegowda International Airport as the recipient of the award in India.  Confusing these two projects demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the specific recipients of the award.  Accurate recall of the award recipients is crucial for understanding the recognition given to different architectural projects.


**10. With reference to the  Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented biennially (every two years) by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
2. Satyajit Ray was among the recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented *annually*, not biennially, and that it is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  The statement contains multiple inaccuracies regarding the award's frequency and the awarding body, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about the details of this prestigious award.  Accurate information about the award's administration is essential for understanding its institutional context.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly lists Satyajit Ray among the notable recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.  This highlights the prestigious nature of the award and its recognition of significant contributions to Indian cinema.  Knowledge of the award's recipients is essential for understanding the history of Indian cinema and its most influential figures.

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories significantly expanded Chola control over the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire extended Chola influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, but did not include the annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Rajaraja I's naval prowess established Chola dominance over the Bay of Bengal, transforming it into a "Chola lake." This maritime control facilitated extensive trade with Southeast Asian countries, a key aspect of their "Look East Policy," with Nagapattinam serving as a crucial trading hub.  His victory at Kandalursalai against the Chera navy further solidified this dominance.  The statement accurately reflects the expansion of Chola power and its economic implications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Rajendra I did launch a major expedition against the Sailendra Empire, successfully conquering regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, the statement misrepresents his conquest of Sri Lanka.  Historical records indicate that Rajendra I's naval campaign resulted in the *entire* island of Sri Lanka becoming a Chola province, a significant territorial expansion not mentioned in the second statement. The statement incorrectly downplays the extent of his Sri Lankan conquest.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to Transhumance and its practice in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The practice of transhumance is primarily confined to the Himalayan region, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas who rear sheep and goats.
2.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland, while a recognized example of transhumance,  is not directly linked to the transhumance practices prevalent in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Himalayan region is indeed a significant area for transhumance in India, involving the mentioned nomadic tribes, the practice is not *primarily* confined to this region. The statement overlooks the existence of transhumance in the plains of several Indian states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  This shows a limited understanding of the geographical spread of this practice in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and the Indian transhumance practices, while both examples of the seasonal livestock movement, are distinct traditions with different geographical contexts and cultural practices.  The statement correctly points out the lack of a direct link between the Swiss tradition and the specific plains mentioned in India. The recognition of both as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity does not imply a direct connection between them.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The inclusion of manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register signifies the importance of these works to Indian literary heritage, but not necessarily to the broader Asia-Pacific region.
2. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, exclusively focused on South Asian literary works.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The inclusion of the mentioned Indian literary works in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register highlights their significance not only to Indian literary heritage but also to the broader Asia-Pacific region.  The statement incorrectly limits the register's scope and the international recognition these works receive.  The MOW program aims to preserve and promote documentary heritage globally.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, while featuring the inclusion of the Indian manuscripts, did not exclusively focus on South Asian literary works.  The register includes works from various countries across the Asia-Pacific region, demonstrating the wider scope of the program's cultural preservation efforts. The statement provides a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the meeting's agenda.  Both statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the 2024 T20 World Cup, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 T20 World Cup, won by India for the second time, was jointly hosted by the USA and the West Indies, marking a significant expansion of the tournament's geographical reach.
2. The International Cricket Council (ICC), headquartered in Dubai, UAE, is responsible for organizing the T20 World Cup, but it did not introduce the Twenty20 format of cricket.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The information accurately reflects that India won the 2024 T20 World Cup, marking their second victory.  The joint hosting by the USA and West Indies is also factually accurate, showcasing a geographical expansion of the tournament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ICC, while responsible for organizing the T20 World Cup, did not introduce the Twenty20 format itself.  The statement wrongly attributes the introduction of the format to the ICC.  The Twenty20 format emerged independently within the cricketing world and was later adopted and popularized by the ICC. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the renaming of Port Blair, consider the following statements:**

1. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram signifies the strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, highlighting their historical connection to the Chola Empire's naval base.
2.  The renaming primarily commemorates Subhas Chandra Bose's unfurling of the Indian flag in the islands, and the Cellular Jail's historical significance, with the Chola Empire's naval presence being a secondary consideration.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram is indeed intended to emphasize the strategic importance of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, both historically and currently. The reference to the Chola Empire's naval base in the islands is a significant element of this renaming.

Statement 2 is also correct. The renaming also commemorates Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's unfurling of the Indian flag and the historical significance of the Cellular Jail. However, the statement incorrectly positions the Chola Empire's naval presence as a secondary consideration.  Both aspects – the colonial legacy break and the tribute to Bose and the Cellular Jail – are integral to the renaming decision. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**6. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, is India's highest award in the field of cinema and includes a cash prize currently valued at ₹10 lakhs.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed India's highest award in cinema, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals. The statement accurately mentions the current cash prize value.

Statement 2 is also correct. The listed individuals are all recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. The statement correctly points out that the award was instituted in 1969 to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**7. With reference to the Virupaksha Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Virupaksha Temple, located in Hampi (Karnataka), is a prime example of Dravidian architecture, and its construction spanned centuries, with contributions from various dynasties including the Chalukyas, Pallavas, Hoysalas, Cholas, and Vijayanagara rulers.
2. The temple's collapse of the 'saalu mantap' pavilion was primarily due to the temple's age and the deterioration of its structural integrity, unrelated to recent torrential rains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Virupaksha Temple's architectural style, location in Hampi, and the contributions of various dynasties over centuries are all accurately described. The statement correctly identifies the temple as a prime example of Dravidian architecture and acknowledges the diverse historical influences on its construction.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the age and potential deterioration of the temple's structure might have been contributing factors, the news reports explicitly linked the collapse of the 'saalu mantap' to recent torrential rains.  The statement incorrectly downplays the role of the immediate cause of the collapse. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Jagannath Temple, Puri, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jagannath Temple's architecture features a Pidha deula-style Jagamohana (assembly hall) with diminishing tiers (pidhas), a Natamandapa (audience/dancing hall), and a Bhogamandapa (hall for residuary offerings).
2. The Ratna Bhandar (treasury) located on the northern side of the Jagamohana comprises an outer chamber (Bahar Bhandar) and an inner chamber (Bhitar Bhandar), and its contents are publicly accessible for research purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. This statement accurately describes the architectural features of the Jagannath Temple, including the style of the Jagamohana, and the presence of the Natamandapa and Bhogamandapa.  The description of the architectural elements is precise and factually accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ratna Bhandar's location and the existence of the inner and outer chambers are correct, the statement incorrectly claims that its contents are publicly accessible for research.  The contents of the Ratna Bhandar are not publicly accessible due to security and preservation concerns.  The statement misrepresents the accessibility of the treasury's contents. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**9. With reference to the Olympic Games and India's performance, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of National Handloom Day. Statement 1 correctly identifies the historical connection to the Swadeshi Movement of 1905 and highlights the significant role of women in the handloom industry.  While the exact figures on employment might fluctuate, the handloom sector's substantial contribution to rural employment and its predominantly female workforce are well-established facts. Statement 2 correctly states the inaugural year of National Handloom Day (2015) and its purpose of honoring weavers and boosting the sector. The description of the industry as the "largest cottage industry" and "second-largest employment provider in rural India" are both generally accepted characterizations, though precise rankings can vary depending on the data source and methodology.  Therefore, both statements are largely correct representations of factual information related to National Handloom Day.


**2. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk is produced by the Philosamia ricini silkworm, a multivoltine species reared indoors, allowing for 5-6 harvests annually. It is considered the world's only vegan silk because the moth is not killed to harvest the silk, instead exiting the cocoon naturally.
2.  India produces all five types of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tropical Tasar, Temperate Tasar, and Muga.

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key aspects of the Phanigiri archaeological site. Statement 1 accurately details the site's location, its Buddhist character with specific structures mentioned, and the recent discovery of Ikshvaku-era coins. The mention of economic insights from the coin hoard is a reasonable inference from such a discovery. Statement 2 correctly explains the meaning of the name "Phanigiri" and accurately reflects the evidence for the simultaneous presence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism, based on inscriptions and architectural styles found at the site.

2.  The criteria for declaring a language as a "Classical Language" include a history of at least 1500-2000 years of literary tradition, significant contributions to the country's culture and heritage, and the language's ceasing to be a living language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Government of India did establish a category for "Classical Languages" in 2004 based on specific criteria, and the languages mentioned have recently been added to this list.  The statement accurately reflects the initiative and its recent additions. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While a long literary history is a criterion, the requirement that the language cease to be a living language is not a condition for classical language status.  All the languages granted classical status are still actively used.  Therefore, only Statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**16. With reference to prehistoric rock paintings in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The earliest rock paintings in India date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, featuring linear representations of animals like bison, elephants, and tigers, along with stick-like human figures in green and dark red pigments.

2.  Despite being a monarchy, the Ahom Dynasty's power was significantly vested in the Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris).  There were periods in the 14th century when there were no kings due to the lack of a suitable candidate.

The description of the administrative structure is accurate. Statement 2 correctly reiterates the power of the Council of Ministers and accurately mentions the periods without kings in the 14th century due to the lack of suitable candidates.  The adoption of Shaivism and the Shakti movement and the construction of temples, including Kamakhya Devi Temple, are also accurate. Therefore, both statements provide accurate information about the Ahom Dynasty.


**20. With reference to Kozhikode (Calicut) in Kerala, consider the following statements:**

**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited forays into the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence across Southeast Asia, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did consolidate Chola power along the Coromandel Coast, his naval expeditions extended far beyond this region. His destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and his conquest of parts of Sri Lanka demonstrate a broader reach than just the Coromandel Coast.  The statement misrepresents the scope of his naval power by underplaying his conquests in the Bay of Bengal and beyond.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's military campaign against the Sailendra Empire led to significant territorial gains in Southeast Asia, specifically in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion represents a significant milestone in the Chola Empire's maritime power and its influence in the region. The success of this expedition underscores the strength and reach of the Chola navy.  The accurate depiction of this conquest contrasts sharply with the limited scope presented in statement 1.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. Transhumance is a primarily a pastoral practice limited to mountainous regions, with minimal presence in plains.
2. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses exclusively on European transhumance traditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although transhumance is prevalent in mountainous regions like the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it's also practiced in plains regions of India such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The statement inaccurately restricts the practice to only mountainous areas, ignoring its significant presence in plains regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is indeed led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, its focus is not exclusively on European traditions.  The initiative aims to recognize and protect transhumance practices globally, not just in Europe.  The statement falsely limits the initiative's scope, neglecting its global perspective and the inclusion of non-European traditions.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register includes only manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, excluding any works from other continents.
2. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are the only Indian literary works included in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the register primarily focuses on manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, it does not explicitly exclude works from other continents if they are relevant to the region's documentary heritage. The statement's restrictive nature misrepresents the register's inclusive approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The three mentioned works are included, but the statement falsely claims they are the *only* Indian works included.  The passage explicitly states that they were included *along with 17 other works from the region*.  This inaccuracy undermines the statement's validity.


**4. With reference to the Abhaya Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Abhaya Mudra is a hand gesture exclusively associated with the Buddha, never used in other religious or cultural contexts.
2. The Bhumisparsha Mudra signifies the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment through meditation, unassociated with any external events.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra is prominently associated with the Buddha, symbolizing fearlessness, its use is not limited to Buddhism alone.  Other religious or cultural traditions may also employ similar gestures with analogous meanings. The statement incorrectly restricts the Mudra's usage to a single religious tradition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha Mudra, while representing a call to the earth to witness, is specifically linked to the Buddha overcoming Mara's temptations during his meditation.  Therefore, it is directly related to an external event, contradicting the statement's claim of it being unassociated with such events. The statement misrepresents the contextual significance of the Mudra.


**5. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA aims to facilitate the unrestricted import of all Indian antiquities into the United States, promoting cultural exchange.
2.  The CPA's primary mechanism for preventing illicit trafficking relies solely on international collaborations, with minimal domestic enforcement measures in either country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CPA's purpose is precisely the *opposite* – to *prevent* and *curb* the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities into the US.  The statement completely misrepresents the agreement's core objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While international collaboration (like Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention) is a component, the CPA also involves domestic legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms in both the US and India to facilitate the seizure and repatriation of illicitly trafficked artifacts.  The statement ignores the crucial role of domestic legal frameworks in enforcing the agreement.


**6. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN's proclamation of IYD was solely driven by India's initiative, without any significant support from other member states.
2. Yoga's origins are definitively traced to Patanjali's Yogasutra, with no earlier evidence of yogic practices in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India proposed the draft resolution for IYD, it received overwhelming support from 175 member states, highlighting the global recognition of yoga's benefits. The statement erroneously diminishes the international consensus behind the UN's decision.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Patanjali's Yogasutra provides a systematic framework for yoga, evidence from the Indus Valley Civilization (seals and fossil remains) suggests the practice existed much earlier. The statement incorrectly presents Patanjali's work as the sole origin, neglecting earlier evidence.


**7. With reference to Kasturi Cotton Bharat, consider the following statements:**

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a government-led initiative that aims to eliminate the role of private sector ginners in the production and certification process.
2. The initiative solely focuses on domestic market expansion, without any consideration for enhancing global competitiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat explicitly *empowers* all ginners in India to produce the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.  The statement incorrectly suggests the exclusion of private sector participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A core objective of Kasturi Cotton Bharat is to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through traceability and certification.  The statement misrepresents the initiative's goal by neglecting its international focus.


**8. With reference to Project PARI (Public Art of India), consider the following statements:**

1. Project PARI is a centrally-funded initiative executed solely by the Ministry of Culture, without involvement of other institutions.
2. Project PARI focuses exclusively on promoting contemporary art forms, neglecting traditional Indian art styles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Culture initiates Project PARI, its execution involves Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.  The statement falsely claims sole execution by the Ministry.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Project PARI explicitly includes traditional Indian art forms like Thangka painting, Cheriyal painting, Bani Thani Painting, and Alpana art alongside contemporary styles. The statement incorrectly portrays a focus solely on contemporary art.


**9. With reference to the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act primarily focuses on regulating the import of antiquities into India, with minimal provisions for preventing their export.
2. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) plays no role in the coordination and recovery of traced antiquities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Section 3 of the Act specifically *prevents* the export of antiquities from India.  The statement misrepresents the Act's focus on preventing export.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states that if an antiquity is traced, the ASI is responsible for coordinating its recovery. The statement wrongly asserts the ASI's lack of involvement.


**10. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1. The museum commemorates the victims of the 1993 Latur earthquake, a significant seismic event in India.
2. The museum is located in a region historically significant only for its association with the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, lacking other historical landmarks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, not the 1993 Latur earthquake.  The statement provides an incorrect date for the earthquake memorialized.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The museum's location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill also includes Bhujio Fort, built in 1723, demonstrating a historical significance beyond the 2001 earthquake.  The statement ignores the pre-existing historical significance of the location.


**11. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented biennially (every two years), recognizing outstanding contributions to Indian cinema.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is presented *annually*, not biennially. The statement provides an incorrect frequency for the award's presentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Besides the cash prize, the recipient receives a Golden Lotus medallion and a shawl. The statement omits these significant symbolic components of the award.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kalinga War was brutal and led to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, it didn't result in the complete annihilation of the Kalinga army or the total destruction of its infrastructure.  The statement exaggerates the war's outcome.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Kharavela's reign is well-documented for his significant patronage of Jainism, as evidenced by the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves.  The statement incorrectly minimizes his support for Jainism, emphasizing Hinduism instead.


**13. With reference to the newly discovered archaeological sites in Telangana, consider the following statements:**

1. The newly discovered sites are exclusively from the medieval period, with no evidence of earlier settlements or artifacts.
2. Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic monument, are uniquely found in the Devarlabanda Mula site, absent in other regions of Telangana.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The discovery includes Ooragutta, an Iron Age megalithic site, indicating settlements predating the medieval period.  The statement falsely restricts the discoveries to the medieval period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While dolmenoid cists were found at Devarlabanda Mula, the passage indicates they are also commonly found in other regions of Telangana. The statement incorrectly suggests their unique presence at only one site.


**14. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sangama Dynasty, the empire's founding dynasty, maintained its power throughout the empire's existence, without any succession by other dynasties.
2. The empire's land administration system relied solely on a centralized bureaucratic structure, with minimal involvement of local chieftains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vijayanagara Empire saw a succession of dynasties after the Sangama Dynasty, including the Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties. The statement incorrectly claims the Sangama Dynasty's uninterrupted rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The empire's land administration significantly involved Amara-Nayakas, military commanders granted territories to rule, showcasing a decentralized element alongside the centralized structure.  The statement ignores the crucial role of these local chieftains.


**15. With reference to the Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1. The ancient Nalanda University was exclusively a center for Buddhist studies, with no other disciplines taught.
2. The modern Nalanda University is solely funded by the Government of India, without any international collaborations or support.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ancient Nalanda University offered a wide range of subjects, including Vedas, Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and war strategy. The statement inaccurately limits its curriculum to only Buddhist studies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The establishment of the modern Nalanda University was initiated at the 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines, indicating international involvement from its inception. The statement falsely claims sole funding by the Indian government.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indus script remains undeciphered, hindering a complete understanding of their social structure and religious beliefs. The statement falsely claims its complete decipherment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Evidence suggests extensive trade with Mesopotamia, with mentions of Meluha (Indus region) in Mesopotamian records and the discovery of Indus artifacts in other regions. The statement incorrectly denies the existence of external trade.


**17. With reference to Lothal, consider the following statements:**

1. Lothal is located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, far from any major river systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The dry dock's discovery offers significant insights into their understanding of tides, winds, and other nautical factors.  The statement wrongly claims a lack of such insights.


**18. With reference to the Gandhi Sarovar/Kedarnath Temple, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gandhi Sarovar is located in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
2. The avalanche that hit the Gandhi Sarovar did not cause any significant damage to the Kedarnath Temple itself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on consolidating control over the Coromandel Coast, with limited expansion beyond the Bay of Bengal.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire significantly expanded Chola influence into Southeast Asia, including parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did strengthen Chola control over the Coromandel Coast, his naval power extended far beyond the Bay of Bengal. His destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and his conquests of Sri Lanka and the Maldives demonstrate a broader reach than suggested in the statement.  The statement misrepresents the scale of his naval ambitions.

Statement 2 is correct. Rajendra I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire is a well-documented example of Chola naval power projecting far into Southeast Asia. His conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra greatly expanded the empire's territorial reach and influence, establishing a significant presence in the region. This significantly expanded Chola influence and trade networks.

1. Transhumance is primarily practiced in arid and semi-arid regions of the world, where seasonal rainfall patterns dictate livestock migration.
2. The recognition of Transhumance in 10 European States and the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland as Intangible Cultural Heritages highlights the practice's global significance and its adaptation to diverse environments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While arid and semi-arid regions are certainly locations where transhumance is practiced, the statement incorrectly limits its practice to only these areas. The text explicitly mentions the prevalence of transhumance in the Himalayas, a mountainous region, demonstrating that it's adapted to various geographical contexts beyond arid zones.  The practice is not solely dependent on rainfall patterns; altitude and pasture availability are crucial factors in many regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNESCO recognition of transhumance traditions in Europe and Switzerland underscores the practice's global importance and its enduring relevance in diverse cultural and environmental settings.  The recognition highlights its cultural value and its continuing role in shaping human-environment interactions across the world.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, consider the following statements:**

1. The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register exclusively features documents and manuscripts from countries within the Asia-Pacific region, excluding any works from outside the region.
2. The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register reflects the rich diversity of India's literary heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The statement falsely claims exclusivity. While the question refers to the Asia-Pacific Register, the text notes that the register includes works from *across* the region.  The inclusion of 17 other works alongside the three Indian works directly contradicts the assertion of exclusivity to only the Asia-Pacific region.

Statement 2 is correct. The inclusion of these three significant Indian literary works highlights the vast and diverse literary heritage of India. These works represent different genres (epic poem, fables, poetics) and linguistic traditions (Awadhi, Sanskrit), showcasing the richness and depth of India's literary contributions.  The selection underscores the importance of preserving these texts for future generations.


**4. With reference to National Handloom Day, consider the following statements:**

1. The selection of August 7th to commemorate National Handloom Day is directly linked to the significant contributions of handloom weavers to India's independence struggle.
2.  The celebration of National Handloom Day highlights the crucial role of the handloom industry in providing employment, particularly for women, in rural India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While August 7th commemorates the Swadeshi movement, the statement incorrectly connects this directly to handloom weavers' participation in the independence struggle. Although the Swadeshi movement encouraged the use of Indian-made goods including handloom textiles,  the date's selection is primarily linked to the launch of the Swadeshi Movement itself and not specifically to the handloom sector's role in the independence movement.

Statement 2 is correct. The celebration of National Handloom Day emphasizes the socio-economic importance of the handloom industry, particularly its role as a major employment provider in rural areas and the significant contribution of women to this sector (70% of weavers and allied workers are women). This aspect highlights the industry's contribution to poverty reduction and rural development.


**5. With reference to Eri Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Eri silk production involves a process that prioritizes the well-being of the silkworm, earning it the distinction of being the world's only vegan silk.
2. The multivoltine nature of the Philosamia ricini silkworm allows for year-round Eri silk production, significantly impacting the economic prospects of rural communities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The unique feature of Eri silk production is the non-lethal harvesting method. The moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, making it a cruelty-free alternative to other silk varieties. This ethical aspect contributes to its recognition as the world's only vegan silk, appealing to consumers with ethical concerns.

Statement 2 is correct. The multivoltine nature of the Philosamia ricini silkworm, which allows for multiple harvests per year (5-6 times), directly impacts the economic viability of Eri silk production. This characteristic enhances the economic opportunities for rural communities involved in its production, providing a more consistent income stream.


**6. With reference to Denisovans, consider the following statements:**

1.  Fossil evidence suggests that Denisovans were geographically confined to the Tibetan Plateau, with limited distribution beyond this region.
2. Genetic studies indicate that Denisovans interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans, contributing to the genetic diversity of some present-day populations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the recent discovery of Denisovan remains in a Tibetan cave provides evidence of their presence in Tibet, the statement wrongly restricts their geographical range. The text indicates that Denisovans may have ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia during the last Ice Age, suggesting a far wider distribution than solely the Tibetan Plateau.  The discovery in Tibet adds to, but does not define, their overall geographical spread.

Statement 2 is correct.  Genetic research strongly supports interbreeding between Denisovans and both Neanderthals and modern humans.  This interbreeding contributed to the genetic makeup of certain present-day populations, particularly in regions where Denisovans were present. This genetic legacy highlights the complex evolutionary relationships between different hominin groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the exact criteria aren't explicitly detailed, the overall aim of the MoW Programme, as stated in the text, is to preserve the world's documentary heritage. This implies a focus on documents of global historical or cultural significance, aiming to make this heritage universally accessible and promote awareness.  The selection process would inherently prioritize documents of broader importance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection and Saiva manuscripts as examples of Indian entries in the MoW International Register.  This exemplifies the diverse range of India's documentary heritage, spanning various fields such as medicine and religious traditions.  Their inclusion showcases the richness and significance of India's contributions to global knowledge.


**8. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is awarded annually to a select group of writers who have made exceptional contributions to Indian literature in various languages.
2. Ruskin Bond's significant contributions to Indian English literature, exemplified by his works such as "Vagrants in the Valley" and "Once Upon a Monsoon Time," led to his being awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly suggests that the fellowship is awarded annually to *multiple* writers. While the text doesn't specify the frequency of the award, it describes the fellowship as the *highest* honour, implying it's not a regularly awarded prize given to multiple recipients yearly. The description of the fellowship as reserved for "immortals of literature" suggests a more selective and infrequent award process.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Ruskin Bond was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, recognizing his significant body of work in Indian English literature.  The mention of specific titles like "Vagrants in the Valley" and "Once Upon a Monsoon Time" further emphasizes his considerable literary contributions.


**9. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1. IAD commemorates the day when Lord Buddha delivered his first sermon, setting in motion the wheel of Dharma.
2. The observance of IAD coincides with the conclusion of the three-month rainy retreat (Vassa) for Buddhist monks and the Pavāraṇā festival.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly connects IAD to the first sermon (Dharmachakrapravartana). While the first sermon is a significant event in Buddhism, IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from the celestial realm, a different event.  The text clearly distinguishes between these two important events.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that IAD coincides with the end of the rainy retreat (Vassa) and the Pavāraṇā festival. This temporal connection highlights the significance of IAD within the Buddhist calendar and its association with a period of monastic reflection and communal observance.


**10. With reference to the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CPA primarily focuses on preventing the illicit trafficking of antiquities from the United States to India, aiming to protect American cultural heritage.
2. The CPA complements existing national and international efforts to combat illicit trafficking, such as the 1970 UNESCO Convention and India's Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement misrepresents the direction of the illicit trafficking the CPA aims to prevent.  The text clearly indicates that the agreement targets the illicit movement of *Indian* antiquities to the *United States*, not the other way around.  The agreement's focus is on protecting Indian cultural heritage.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the CPA is designed to work alongside existing frameworks, both national (India's Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972) and international (the 1970 UNESCO Convention).  This collaborative approach reflects a broader international commitment to combating illicit trafficking in cultural property.  The agreement strengthens existing mechanisms for the repatriation of stolen artifacts.


**11. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1. The United Nations' proclamation of June 21st as IYD was primarily driven by the efforts of several countries that recognized the global importance of promoting physical well-being.
2.  The observance of IYD on the summer solstice holds symbolic significance, aligning with the holistic philosophy of yoga that emphasizes the harmony between humans and nature.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the statement is not explicitly false, it downplays India's crucial role. The text explicitly states that the draft resolution for IYD was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 member states. This highlights India's leading role in establishing IYD and promoting yoga globally.  The statement overlooks this key aspect.

Statement 2 is correct. The selection of the summer solstice (June 21st) as IYD is not arbitrary. The text highlights the alignment of this date with the holistic philosophy of yoga. The summer solstice, with its emphasis on the sun's energy and the natural world, symbolically connects with yoga's emphasis on the harmony between humans and nature.  This symbolic connection enhances the significance of the day.


**12. With reference to Swami Vivekananda's contributions, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago primarily focused on promoting a syncretic approach to religious beliefs, emphasizing commonalities between different faiths.
2. Swami Vivekananda's establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission served to consolidate his philosophical ideas and expand his influence, while simultaneously undertaking social service initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While the exact content of his speech is not fully detailed, the description of his address being hailed as a "messenger of Indian wisdom" indicates that he presented Vedanta philosophy to a Western audience. This implicitly suggests a significant focus on introducing Indian philosophical thought, even if he did promote a syncretic approach.  The statement accurately reflects the general aim of his address.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Swami Vivekananda established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897 to engage in various social service activities.  The establishment of this organization served to both disseminate his philosophical ideas and actively implement his vision of social reform through practical actions.  The statement correctly connects the mission's establishment to both philosophical and social goals.

2.  The launch of the Tata Nano and the recognition by PETA India for using vegan interiors in the AVINYA Concept car showcase the group's commitment to innovation and sustainability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement makes an unsubstantiated claim about global expansion. The text focuses on the growth of the Tata Group *within India*, noting a revenue surge and its position as a major employer.  There is no mention of significant global market expansion under Ratan Tata's leadership in the provided text.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the launch of the Tata Nano as a significant achievement under Ratan Tata's leadership.  It also highlights the PETA India award for the AVINYA Concept car's vegan interiors, demonstrating a commitment to innovation and sustainability within the Tata Group.  These examples directly support the statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement wrongly excludes sports. The text doesn't specify any fields that are excluded from consideration for the Bharat Ratna.  The award's broad scope encompasses outstanding service across *any* field, implying that contributions from the field of sports would also be considered.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly describes the Prime Minister's role. The text explicitly states that while the Prime Minister *makes* recommendations to the President, no formal recommendations are necessary.  The process is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny; the President's decision is not dependent on parliamentary approval.


**15. With reference to the Vijayanagara Empire's political structure, consider the following statements:**

1. The Amara-Nayakas system ensured centralized control over the empire's vast territories, preventing any significant challenges to the Raya's authority.
2. The Ayagar system, operating at the village level, provided a mechanism for revenue collection and local administration under the Vijayanagara Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement misrepresents the Amara-Nayakas system. While they were military commanders granted territories, this system didn't guarantee centralized control. The Amara-Nayakas had considerable autonomy, and their power sometimes posed challenges to the Raya's authority.  The system was decentralized in its implementation, leading to potential conflicts.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly describes the Ayagar system as a village-level administrative structure within the Vijayanagara Empire. This system was responsible for revenue collection and other local administrative functions, demonstrating a hierarchical system with local administrative units. The description accurately reflects the system's role.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Virupaksha Temple as one of the architectural marvels of the Vijayanagara Empire and confirms its location within the Hampi complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This statement accurately reflects the temple's significance and location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly places the Hazara Rama Temple. While the text mentions the Hazara Rama Temple as an architectural marvel, it doesn't specify its location relative to the Hampi complex.  To state definitively that it's *outside* the complex is inaccurate based on the provided information. The location is not explicitly detailed in the given text.


**17. With reference to the literary works of the Vijayanagara Empire, consider the following statements:**

1. Krishnadevaraya, a prominent ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire, is primarily known for his military achievements, with limited literary contributions.
2.  Amuktamalyada, a work on statecraft, and Jambavati Kalyanam, a Sanskrit play, are attributed to Krishnadevaraya, showcasing his multifaceted abilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement underestimates Krishnadevaraya's literary contributions. The text explicitly mentions Amuktamalyada and Jambavati Kalyanam as works attributed to him, demonstrating his literary skills alongside his military prowess.  The statement incorrectly minimizes his intellectual achievements.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately attributes Amuktamalyada (a work on statecraft) and Jambavati Kalyanam (a Sanskrit play) to Krishnadevaraya.  This highlights his multifaceted talents, including his literary pursuits alongside his political and military achievements.  The statement correctly identifies his literary works.


**18. With reference to the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indus Valley Civilization's trade networks were primarily confined to the Indian subcontinent, with limited interaction with other regions of the world.
2. The discovery of standardized weights and measures in the Indus Valley Civilization suggests a well-organized system of trade and commerce.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly limits the trade networks. The text explicitly mentions Mesopotamian records referring to the Indus region and detailing trade interactions with Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast). This demonstrates that the Indus Valley Civilization had extensive trade connections beyond the Indian subcontinent.  The statement misrepresents the scope of their trade.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the Indus Valley Civilization employed standardized weights and measures.  This is strong evidence of a well-organized and sophisticated system of trade and commerce, indicating a high degree of economic organization and integration. The statement accurately reflects the evidence.


**19. With reference to the religious and cultural practices of the Indus Valley Civilization, consider the following statements:**

1. The discovery of temples dedicated to specific deities in Indus Valley sites provides insights into their religious beliefs and practices.
2.  The prevalence of Mother Goddess figurines and the representation of the male deity Pasupati (proto-Siva) indicate a complex religious system with diverse deities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement is factually incorrect. The text explicitly states that *no temples* have been found in Indus Valley sites. This directly contradicts the statement's assertion.  The absence of temples suggests a different form of religious expression compared to later civilizations.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the presence of Mother Goddess figurines and the representation of Pasupati (proto-Siva) in seals. This evidence points to a complex religious system with multiple deities and possibly a blend of nature worship and ancestor veneration.  The statement accurately reflects the archaeological findings.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly specifies a focus on technical achievements. While the text doesn't explicitly define the criteria, it refers to the award as a *lifetime achievement* award, suggesting a broader recognition of contributions to Indian cinema, not limited to technical aspects.  The statement wrongly restricts the award's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly details the award's components: a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize.  This accurately reflects the tangible elements of the award, symbolizing the honor bestowed on the recipient.  The statement correctly describes the award's presentation.


**27. With reference to the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2001 Gujarat Earthquake, with its epicenter in Bhuj, had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale, causing widespread devastation and loss of life.
2. The Bhujio Fort, located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, played a significant role in mitigating the impact of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake by providing shelter to a large number of affected people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly states that the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale, with Bhuj as the epicenter.  This information is directly stated in the text.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement is unsubstantiated. The text mentions the Bhujio Fort's location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill but makes no claim about its role in mitigating the earthquake's impact.  There is no information provided to support the assertion of the fort providing shelter.  The statement is not supported by the text.



**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories significantly expanded Chola control over the Malabar Coast, leading to the annexation of significant portions of the present-day Kerala.
2. Rajendra I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire resulted in the establishment of a long-lasting Chola presence in Southeast Asia, with extensive trade networks and administrative structures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I did defeat the Chera navy at Kandalursalai and expand Chola influence, the statement overstates the extent of Chola control over the Malabar Coast.  Chola control was more of a fluctuating presence with periods of dominance and periods of less influence. The annexation of significant portions of present-day Kerala is an oversimplification of a complex political landscape.  The Cholas' influence extended, but complete annexation wasn't a consistent or total achievement along the entire Malabar Coast.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Rajendra I's conquest of parts of the Sailendra Empire (specifically regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra) did establish a Chola presence in Southeast Asia. However, describing it as "long-lasting" and with "extensive trade networks and administrative structures" is an exaggeration.  The Chola presence, while significant, was not permanent. While trade certainly existed, it wasn't necessarily a fully established and extensive network in the way suggested. The administrative structures were also likely limited in scope and duration. The statement overemphasizes the permanence and extent of Chola influence in Southeast Asia.


**2. With reference to Transhumance, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses exclusively on the preservation of traditional livestock movement practices in Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while initiated by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan, has a broader scope than just Europe.  Its aim is to promote the recognition and preservation of transhumance practices globally, not limiting itself to European traditions. The inclusion of transhumance traditions from various parts of the world in the intangible cultural heritage lists demonstrates the initiative's global focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayan regions of India involving the mentioned nomadic tribes, it is also practiced in other parts of the country, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The statement wrongly restricts the practice to only the Himalayan region, ignoring its presence in other geographical areas.


**3. With reference to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dolmenoid cists are, in fact, semi-subterranean chamber tombs, not above-ground structures.  The description of their construction in the statement is inaccurate. They are indeed associated with burial practices, but the statement's description of their construction is the key error.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Hire Benkal Megalith Site is under *consideration* for the tentative list of UNESCO, it is not yet inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  The statement incorrectly implies that it already holds this prestigious status.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Phanigiri is primarily a Buddhist site, not associated with early Vedic culture. The statement misrepresents the site's primary cultural affiliation.  The artifacts discovered are predominantly linked to Buddhism, not Vedic traditions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The discovery of a coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period and the presence of architectural remains representing both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist traditions are well-documented aspects of the Phanigiri site.  The statement accurately reflects these archaeological findings.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Denisovans' range extended from Siberia to Southeast Asia, not primarily Africa, during the last Ice Age.  The statement mislocates their geographical distribution.  They coexisted with other hominins in Asia, not primarily Africa.

Statement 2 is correct.  Genetic evidence strongly supports interbreeding between Denisovans, Neanderthals, and modern humans. This interbreeding contributed to the genetic diversity of certain populations alive today.  The statement accurately reflects the current scientific understanding of Denisovan genetics.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register included manuscripts of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, among others.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it misstates the century in which the Ramcharitmanas was written; it was written in the 16th century, not the 17th. Statement 2 is correct; the MoW Programme, established in 1992, indeed maintains three registers (International, Regional, and National) to preserve and promote access to documentary heritage worldwide.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

Statement 2 is correct; Ruskin Bond is a recipient of this prestigious award.  Hence, only statement 2 is accurate.

This makes statement 1 incorrect. However, statement 2 is correct; the Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the IBC, observes IAD annually.  Therefore, only statement 2 is true.


**9. With reference to the Sangameshwar Temple, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is located at the confluence of five tributaries of the Krishna River.

1.  The Kamakhya Temple's architecture is solely based on the Nilachal style, a unique architectural tradition of Assam.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Upper Paleolithic period rock paintings in India predominantly feature animal figures (bison, elephants, tigers, etc.) and linear representations of humans, not detailed scenes of hunting or community activities.

Mesolithic period paintings showcase a greater emphasis on human scenes (hunting, dances), with animals depicted naturalistically and humans in a more stylistic manner. Only statement 2 correctly reflects the characteristics of the respective periods.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kalinga War did lead to the Mauryan annexation of Kalinga, but it didn't result in the complete destruction of the Kalinga army or the immediate end of the dynasty.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lothal is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers, near the Gulf of Khambat, not on the confluence of the Sabarmati and Mahi rivers. This makes statement 1 incorrect.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indus script remains undeciphered, despite its pictographic nature and boustrophedon writing style.  This makes statement 1 incorrect.

The project's focus is on making art more accessible to the public, transforming urban spaces into vibrant cultural hubs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Project PARI promotes a diverse range of art forms, including both traditional and contemporary styles. It explicitly includes various regional art forms such as Thangka painting (Sikkim/Ladakh), Cheriyal painting (Telangana), Bani Thani Painting (Rajasthan), and Alpana art (Tripura), demonstrating a commitment to showcasing the richness and diversity of Indian artistic traditions. The project's scope is not limited to established styles or major cities.

This detail highlights the importance of accurate information regarding the chronology of significant events related to cultural preservation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Memory of the World (MOW) program, initiated in 1992 by UNESCO, does maintain three registers: International, Regional, and National.  These registers serve as a vital tool for identifying, preserving, and promoting documentary heritage of global significance.  The program aims to ensure the long-term survival of important documents and their accessibility to future generations.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda's teachings encompassed various aspects of yoga, his focus was not solely on Bhakti Yoga.  His philosophy incorporated elements of Jnana Yoga (knowledge), Karma Yoga (action), and Raja Yoga (meditation), emphasizing a holistic approach to spiritual development.  Reducing his philosophy to a single yogic path would be an oversimplification.

Statement 2 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's address at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 was indeed a pivotal moment. His eloquent and insightful presentation significantly contributed to the spread of Vedanta philosophy and Indian spirituality in the West, fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of Indian thought in the global context.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The direction of the illicit trafficking is crucial to understanding the agreement's purpose.

Statement 2 is correct.  Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, does indeed prevent the export of antiquities from India.  Furthermore, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) plays a vital role in coordinating the recovery of antiquities traced outside the country.  This highlights the importance of national legislation in protecting cultural heritage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While June 21st (Summer Solstice) is indeed celebrated as International Yoga Day, the UN proclaimed it in 2014, not 2015. The proposal originated from India, not China, and received support from a record 175 member states, not over 170.  These discrepancies highlight the need for accurate information on the chronology and origins of international observances.

Statement 2 is correct. The word "Yoga" is indeed derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to join," symbolizing the unity of mind and body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant movement advocating for temple entry for lower castes, it did not fully succeed in opening all four roads leading to the Vaikom temple. Only three out of the four roads were opened for all castes, demonstrating the limitations of even significant social reform movements.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Vaikom Satyagraha did lead to several legal reforms, most notably the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.  The movement also exposed the differences in approach between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, with Periyar criticizing the partial success and eventually leaving the Congress.  The movement highlighted the complexities of caste-based discrimination and the varied strategies employed to challenge it.

This minor inaccuracy in the date demonstrates the importance of precise chronological information in historical accounts.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were indeed key figures involved in the Kakori Train Action.  These individuals played significant roles in the planning and execution of this daring act of defiance against British rule.  Their participation underscores the diverse backgrounds and motivations of those involved in the Indian independence movement.


**16. With reference to initiatives to promote the sports ecosystem in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The budgetary allocation for sports has nearly tripled from 2014-15 to 2023-24, with the Khelo India program focusing solely on identifying and nurturing elite athletes.
2. Initiatives like the Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program, targeting school children, and the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), providing comprehensive support to top athletes, are key components of India's sports development strategy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the budgetary allocation for sports has significantly increased from 2014-15 to 2023-24 (it nearly doubled, not tripled), the Khelo India program does not focus solely on elite athletes.  It aims to identify and develop athletes at both grassroots and elite levels, encompassing a wider range of talent and developmental stages.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) program, focusing on school children, and the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), providing comprehensive support to top athletes, are indeed integral parts of India's strategy to enhance its sporting prowess.  These initiatives reflect a multi-pronged approach to talent development and high-performance support.


**17. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and its initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The IOA, formed in 1928, coordinates with National Sports Federations to send teams to the Olympics and other international games, and India aims to be among the top five sports nations by 2036.
2.  Initiatives such as the National Sports Development Fund scheme and the Retired Sportsperson Empowerment Training (RESET) Programme are designed to support athletes and empower retired sportspersons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was indeed formed in 1927, not 1928, and it coordinates with National Sports Federations for participation in international games. However, India's aim is to be among the top ten sports nations by 2036, not the top five.  This minor error in the target ranking highlights the importance of precise data in statements.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Sports Development Fund scheme and the Retired Sportsperson Empowerment Training (RESET) Programme are indeed in place to provide financial and career support to athletes and retired sportspersons, respectively.  These initiatives aim to create a more comprehensive and supportive sports ecosystem.


**18. With reference to gallantry awards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1952, and the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra were instituted in 1950.
2.  The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are wartime gallantry awards, while the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1950, not 1952.  The Ashoka Chakra (originally Ashoka Chakra Class I), Kirti Chakra (originally Ashoka Chakra Class II), and Shaurya Chakra (originally Ashoka Chakra Class III) were instituted in 1952, not 1950. The years of institution are reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are indeed wartime gallantry awards, while the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are awarded for peacetime gallantry.  This distinction is crucial to understanding the different contexts in which these awards are bestowed.


**19. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established in 1955, the awards were initially called 'State Awards,' with the Directorate of Film Festivals administering them since 1974.
2.  Awards are given in two categories: Feature Films and Non-Feature Films, with the 'Most Film-Friendly State' award also being presented.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1955, and were initially called 'State Awards'.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered them since 1973, not 1974. These minor inaccuracies highlight the importance of precise factual details.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Film Awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema, not just two.  The 'Most Film-Friendly State' award is also presented alongside these main categories.  The number of categories is crucial to understanding the scope of the awards.


**20. With reference to UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. Granted annually since 2016, the award recognizes outstanding contemporary architectural achievements worldwide, categorized into 24 world titles, including airports, campuses, and museums.
2. Projects considered for the award must be innovative, reflect local heritage, be ecologically efficient, and promote social interaction, and the Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru was honored with this award in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The UNESCO Prix Versailles Award has been granted annually since 2015, not 2016, and it does recognize outstanding contemporary architectural achievements worldwide, categorized into 24 world titles.  The categories mentioned are accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru was honored with the UNESCO Prix Versailles award in 2023, not 2022.  Furthermore, while projects must indeed be innovative, reflect local heritage, be ecologically efficient, and promote social interaction, the statement about the airport is factually incorrect regarding the year.


**1. With reference to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval conquests extended to the Maldives and resulted in the annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
2.  Rajendra I's reign saw the complete subjugation of Sri Lanka, transforming it into a Chola province, and a significant expedition against the Sailendra Empire.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Rajaraja I, a prominent Chola ruler, significantly expanded the empire's naval reach.  His conquests included the Maldives and the northern portion of Sri Lanka, which was brought under Chola control. This reflects the growing naval power and imperial ambition of the Cholas during his reign.

Statement 2 is also correct. Rajendra I, succeeding Rajaraja I, continued the aggressive naval expansion policy.  His military campaigns resulted in the complete annexation of Sri Lanka, making it a Chola province.  Furthermore, his expedition against the Sailendra Empire, a powerful maritime power in Southeast Asia, showcases the extent of Chola naval dominance and its influence in the region.  The Sailendra Empire's territories spanned across the Malay Peninsula and neighboring islands, adding to the significance of Rajendra I's military success.  The conquest of territories within the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra underscores the far-reaching impact of Chola naval power.


**2. With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1.  The initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses on the seasonal movement of livestock and associated human communities, a practice known as transhumance.
2.  In 2023, transhumance traditions from Switzerland and ten European states were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, while India's transhumance practices are primarily confined to the Himalayan region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative.  ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites), a leading organization in the field of cultural heritage, leads this initiative, with support from Azerbaijan.  The core focus is on transhumance, the traditional seasonal movement of livestock and the human communities that depend on this practice for their livelihood.  This highlights the initiative's commitment to preserving and recognizing the cultural and economic significance of this ancient practice.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While it's true that transhumance traditions from Switzerland and ten European states received recognition in 2023 as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, the assertion that India's transhumance practices are limited to the Himalayas is inaccurate.  Transhumance is practiced in various regions of India, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  The Himalayan region is indeed a significant area for transhumance, but it is not the sole location in India where this practice exists.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, established in 1992, includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2.  The 10th meeting of the MOW Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, added these Indian manuscripts to the Register along with 17 other works.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register does indeed include manuscripts of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, the statement incorrectly states that the register was established in 1992. The MOW Programme itself was launched in 1992, but the specific regional registers were established later.

Statement 2 accurately reflects the inclusion of these Indian literary works into the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, formally added these manuscripts, alongside 17 other works from the Asia-Pacific region, to the register.  This decision underscores the importance of preserving these cultural artifacts and recognizing their significance in the broader context of world heritage.


**4. With reference to the Ancient Nalanda University, consider the following statements:**

1.  Founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, Nalanda flourished as a major center of learning until its destruction in 1205 CE by Bakhtiyar Khalji.
2.  The university's curriculum encompassed a wide range of disciplines, including Vedas, Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and military strategy, and its library, "Dharma Gunj," housed over nine million books.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Historical records indicate that Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, a ruler of the Gupta Empire.  It remained a significant center of learning for centuries, attracting scholars from across Asia. Its destruction in 1205 CE by Bakhtiyar Khalji, a Turkish general, marked a tragic end to this renowned institution.

Statement 2 is also correct. Nalanda University offered a diverse and comprehensive curriculum.  It covered various subjects, including the Vedas (representing Hindu scriptures), different schools of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, political science, and even military strategy.  Its extensive library, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," was reputed to house a vast collection of books, estimated to be over nine million.  The scale and breadth of its collection underscore Nalanda's importance as a repository of knowledge.


**5. With reference to the  contributions and legacy of Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

1. Swami Vivekananda's address at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago significantly promoted Vedanta philosophy and was lauded for its eloquence.
2. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, which primarily focuses on religious instruction and spiritual guidance, and played a key role in inspiring the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science (IISC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Swami Vivekananda's impactful address at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago played a crucial role in introducing Vedanta philosophy to a global audience. His oratory skills were widely praised, and his speech is considered a landmark event in the dissemination of Indian spiritual thought to the West.  The event significantly impacted the perception of Hinduism and Indian spirituality in the Western world.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Swami Vivekananda did establish the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, its activities are not limited to religious instruction and spiritual guidance.  The Ramakrishna Mission engages in extensive social service activities, including running hospitals, schools, and colleges.  Although he met with Jamsetji Tata and inspired him,  the statement incorrectly implies a direct and primary role in establishing the Indian Institute of Science (IISC). While Vivekananda's influence on Tata's philanthropic vision was significant, the founding of IISC involved numerous other factors and individuals.


**1. With reference to the Chola dynasty's naval expeditions, consider the following statements:**

1. Rajaraja Chola I's naval victories included the destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest extended to the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Rajaraja Chola I led significant naval expeditions and achieved many victories, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera* navy at Kandalursalai, not the Pandya navy. This detail is crucial for accurate historical recall.  The Pandya dynasty was another significant power in South India, but the source explicitly mentions the Chera.  Confusing the two represents a common type of error in UPSC-style questions testing historical knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text clearly states that Rajendra Chola I launched a major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire, resulting in the conquest of areas within the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. This expansion demonstrates the reach and power of the Chola navy during this period, a key aspect often tested in UPSC examinations.


**2.  With reference to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. The initiative, led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan, focuses solely on the transhumance practices within the Himalayan region of India.
2.  In 2023, two transhumance traditions were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, including one from Switzerland.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while acknowledging the importance of transhumance in the Himalayas (and mentioning specific Indian nomadic tribes), is not limited to that region. The text explicitly states that the practice is prevalent in other areas of India and also globally. The statement falsely restricts the initiative's scope, demonstrating a common UPSC testing technique of assessing understanding of the broader context.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly states that two transhumance traditions, one of which was the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland, received recognition as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023. This highlights the global significance of the initiative and the diverse range of cultural practices it encompasses.


**3. With reference to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, consider the following statements:**

1. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP, held in Beijing, China, included manuscripts of  Panchatantra and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the register.
2. The MoW Programme, launched in 1992, maintains only a single, unified register encompassing all entries worldwide.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the manuscripts of Panchatantra and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were indeed included, the 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC questions.  The location of the meeting is a specific fact that could easily be missed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the MoW Programme maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National.  The existence of multiple registers is a key element of the programme's structure and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the program's organizational setup.


**4. With reference to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum, consider the following statements:**

1. Located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat, the museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
2. The museum features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, utilizing a method developed by the Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki to promote rapid growth and biodiversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text correctly identifies the location and purpose of the museum but incorrectly states the magnitude of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.9, not 7.5, on the Richter scale.  This slight numerical difference is a frequent trap in UPSC-style questions, requiring precise recall of factual details.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the presence of one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests at the museum and correctly attributes the method to the Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki.  The description of the Miyawaki method is also accurate.


**5. With reference to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, consider the following statements:**

1.  Presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, the award was instituted in 1970 to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke.
2.  The award includes a Golden Lotus medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize currently valued at ₹20 lakhs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The award was instituted in 1969, not 1970, to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke. This slight discrepancy in the year highlights the need for precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the award does include a Golden Lotus medallion and a shawl, the current cash prize is ₹10 lakhs, not ₹20 lakhs. The incorrect value of the cash prize serves as a distractor, demonstrating the importance of accurate data recall.


**6. With reference to the Kashi Culture Pathway, consider the following statements:**

1.  Endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group, it is a global initiative primarily focused on promoting traditional Indian art forms.
2.  It forms a significant part of India's efforts to prevent and curb the illicit trafficking of antiquities, complementing existing national legislation such as Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Kashi Culture Pathway was endorsed by the G20 Culture Working Group, its focus is not solely on promoting traditional Indian art forms.  The text mentions it as part of a broader effort to combat illicit trafficking of cultural property. The statement oversimplifies the initiative's goals, creating a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly links the Kashi Culture Pathway to global efforts against illicit trafficking,  mentioning its role in complementing national legislation like Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, which prohibits the export of antiquities from India.


**7. With reference to the 10th International Yoga Day (IYD), consider the following statements:**

1.  Proclaimed by the United Nations in 2015, IYD is observed annually on the summer solstice (June 21).
2.  The draft resolution proposing IYD was initiated by China and garnered support from 170 member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text correctly states that the UN proclaimed June 21st as IYD in 2014 (not 2015) and that this date coincides with the summer solstice. This demonstrates the accurate recall of key facts related to the event.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the draft resolution was proposed by India, not China, and received support from a record 175 member states, not 170. This highlights the importance of accurate attribution of initiatives and precise numerical data in UPSC questions.


**8. With reference to  Abhay Mudra, consider the following statements:**

1.  Displayed by the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, it symbolizes compassion and represents the Buddha's ability to heal suffering.
2.  Other Mudras associated with Buddha include Bhumisparsha (calling the earth to witness) and Dhyana Mudra (mudra of meditation).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Abhay Mudra is indeed displayed by Amoghasiddhi and is used in the context of taming a mad elephant, it primarily symbolizes fearlessness, not compassion and healing. The statement misinterprets the symbolism of the mudra, creating a plausible but incorrect distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately identifies Bhumisparsha and Dhyana Mudra as other mudras associated with the Buddha, correctly describing their respective meanings.  The inclusion of these other mudras tests knowledge beyond just the specific mudra mentioned in the question.


**9. With reference to the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) signed between India and the USA, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CPA aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities solely from India to the USA, and not vice versa.
2.  The agreement facilitates the quick seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities found in the USA, leveraging Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CPA focuses on the flow of antiquities from India to the USA,  it doesn't explicitly exclude the reverse flow.  The statement creates a misleading limitation on the agreement's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the CPA aims to facilitate the quicker seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities, and it mentions the agreement's role in aligning with the broader framework of the 1970 UNESCO Convention (although not specifically Article 9).


**10. With reference to the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Founded in 1928 with Sir Dorabji Tata as its first President, the IOA was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1929.
2.  India's initiatives to promote its sports ecosystem include the Khelo India program and the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), but exclude any budgetary support for sports development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the IOA was formed in 1927 and recognized by the IOC in the same year (1927), not 1928 and 1929 respectively. The dates are crucial for demonstrating precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions budgetary support for sports development as having nearly doubled from 2014-15 to 2023-24. The statement wrongly excludes a key element of India's sports promotion initiatives.


**11. With reference to the Padma Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  Instituted in 1955, the awards are conferred in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.
2.  The awards are typically not conferred posthumously, although exceptions may be made in highly deserving cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, not 1955.  The year of institution is a significant detail, often tested in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately reflects that Padma Awards are not typically given posthumously but that exceptions are possible.  The explanation of the exceptions is also accurate.


**12. With reference to Gallantry Awards, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, Mahavir Chakra, Kirti Chakra, Vir Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are awarded in order of precedence, with the Param Vir Chakra being the highest.
2.  These awards are announced only once a year, on Republic Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately lists the Gallantry Awards in their order of precedence, with the Param Vir Chakra as the highest. This demonstrates knowledge of the hierarchy within the award system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states that Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day.  This highlights the importance of accurately recalling the frequency of announcements.


**13. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. Established in 1955, the awards were initially known as "State Awards" and are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
2. Awards are given in four categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, Best Writing in Cinema, and Best Animation Film.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The National Film Awards were established in 1954, not 1955, and were initially called "State Awards".  The administration by the Directorate of Film Festivals is correctly stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema. It does not mention a category for Best Animation Film.  The incorrect addition of a category acts as a distractor.


**14. With reference to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award, consider the following statements:**

1. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum received the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award in the Museums category in 2023.
2. The award criteria emphasize innovation, reflection of local heritage, ecological efficiency, and promotion of social interaction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was *shortlisted* for the award, not that it actually *received* it.  The distinction between being shortlisted and winning is a crucial point often tested in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the award criteria, emphasizing innovation, reflection of local heritage, ecological efficiency, and promotion of social interaction.  The detailed description of the criteria highlights a deeper understanding of the award's principles.


**15. With reference to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, consider the following statements:**

1. Awarded to Ruskin Bond in 2024, the Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Sahitya Akademi on a writer in recognition of their lifetime contributions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately states that the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor and that it was awarded to Ruskin Bond (although the year is not explicitly given in the text, the context suggests a recent award).

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The text mentions "Vagrants in the Valley" and "Once Upon a Monsoon Time," but "The Room on the Roof"  is not explicitly listed in the provided excerpt.  However,  the mention of numerous other works implies that the statement is largely correct.  Including a partially incorrect element in Statement 2 makes it a more challenging question.



**16. With reference to the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD), consider the following statements:**

1.  Commemorating Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka to Sankassiya, IAD coincides with the end of the first Rainy Retreat (Vassa) and the Pavāraņā festival.
2.  The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observed IAD and celebrated the recent declaration of Sanskrit as a classical language.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes IAD's commemoration and its timing with the end of the Rainy Retreat and the Pavāraņā festival.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions the celebration of Pali being declared a classical language, not Sanskrit.  The substitution of Sanskrit for Pali makes this a challenging distractor, testing precise knowledge of the event.


**17. With reference to Swami Vivekananda, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Vivekananda's influence on Jamsetji Tata and the establishment of the IISC.  The combination of a partially correct and a completely correct statement makes this a difficult question.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Olympic Order is indeed the highest award presented by the IOC, but it was established in 1975, not 1976.  The slight error in the year is a common technique in UPSC-style questions.
