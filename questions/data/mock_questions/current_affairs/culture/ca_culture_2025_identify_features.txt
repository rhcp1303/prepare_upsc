Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the task (creating difficult and nuanced questions with plausible distractors), explanations may be longer than 100 words in some cases to fully justify the correct answer and address potential misconceptions.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  A Sanskrit text on Indian poetics, commented upon by Abhinava Gupta.
2.  An epic poem in Awadhi, narrating the Ramayana.
3.  A collection of fables in Sanskrit, known for its "story within a story" structure.
4.  A collection of Buddhist scriptures, including the Vinaya Pitaka.

How many of the above are included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register, as mentioned in the provided text, includes manuscripts of *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*.

1.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is a Sanskrit text of Indian poetics, fitting the description in statement 1.  Abhinava Gupta's commentary further establishes its authenticity.
2.  *Ramcharitmanas*, Tulsidas's epic poem in Awadhi retelling the Ramayana, matches statement 2.
3.  *Panchatantra*, Vishnu Sharma's collection of fables in Sanskrit, is accurately described in statement 3.

Statement 4, referencing the Buddhist scriptures (Tipitaka including the Vinaya Pitaka), is a distractor. While the Tipitaka is significant in Buddhist literature, it is not explicitly mentioned within the context of the MOW Asia-Pacific register in the provided text.  The question tests knowledge of specific literary works and their inclusion in a particular UNESCO program, requiring precise recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related but distinct literary traditions.


**2. Consider the following statements related to the Chola Empire:**

1.  Their key trading center was located in present-day Andhra Pradesh.
2.  Rajaraja I's naval expeditions included conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
3.  The Chola Empire's naval power significantly declined during Rajendra I's reign.
4.  The Sangam literature extensively details the Chola Empire's maritime activities.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding the Chola Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text mentions Nagapattinam as a key Chola trading center, which refutes statement 1.  Nagapattinam is located in present-day Tamil Nadu, not Andhra Pradesh.  This statement acts as a plausible distractor, playing on the geographical proximity of the two states and the general knowledge of the Chola Empire's coastal influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly states Rajaraja I's conquests of Sri Lanka (annexing the northern part) and the Maldives.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text highlights Rajendra I's significant naval expeditions, including conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, indicating a strong, not weak, naval power during his reign.  The incorrect chronology is a key distractor.

Statement 4 is a distractor. The Sangam literature is mentioned in the text, but its specific detail regarding Chola maritime activities is not detailed.  The question tests the student's knowledge of the Chola Empire's expansion, naval power, and the limitations of historical sources.


**3. Consider the following regarding Prakrit languages:**

1.  Maharashtri Prakrit was the official language of the Satavahanas.
2.  Ardhamāgadhī was used in the earliest Jain texts.
3.  Saurasena Prakrit was predominantly used in religious hymns.
4.  Pali is considered a dialect of Apabhramsha.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics and usage of Prakrit languages?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that modern Marathi descends from Maharashtri Prakrit, which was the official language of the Satavahanas.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text mentions that the earliest Jain texts were composed in Ardhamāgadhī.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that Saurasena Prakrit was particularly used in drama, not religious hymns.  The incorrect genre is a significant distractor.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Pali is linked to Magadhi Prakrit, not Apabhramsha. This plays on the broader classification of Prakrit languages and their relationship to later Indo-Aryan languages.


**4. Consider the following related to the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty marked the empire's zenith.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were primarily administrative officials.
4.  The *Amuktamalyada* is a significant work of Vijayanagara literature.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Tuluva dynasty saw the empire reach its zenith, not the Sangama dynasty.  This uses chronological information to create a difficult distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions Krishnadevaraya's acquisition of the Raichur doab.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Amara-Nayakas were military commanders given territories to rule, not primarily administrative officials.  The blurring of military and administrative roles is a key distractor.

Statement 4 is correct.  *Amuktamalyada*, a work of statecraft by Krishnadevaraya, is mentioned in the text.


**5. Consider the following features of Yoga:**

1.  It is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to bind."
2.  It is categorized as one of the six schools of Indian philosophy.
3.  Its systematic reference is primarily found in the Upanishads.
4.  Evidence of its practice is found in the Indus Valley Civilization.


How many of the above statements correctly describe Yoga?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the text states that "yuj" means "to join," not "to bind." The subtle difference in meaning creates a challenging distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly lists Yoga as one of the six schools of Indian philosophy.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions that systematic reference to Yoga is found in Patanjali's Yogasutra, not the Upanishads.  This utilizes the knowledge of different philosophical texts to create a difficult distractor.

Statement 4 is correct.  The text mentions seals and fossil remains indicating Yoga's prevalence in the Indus Valley Civilization.


These questions demand precise recall of facts, an understanding of subtle differences within concepts, and the ability to identify plausible but ultimately incorrect statements.  They are designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


**1. Consider the following statements about Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1. She was born in the village of Chondi, Ahmednagar.
2.  She patronized Marathi poet Moropant, known for his political commentary on the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
3.  She established Maheshwar as the seat of the Holkar dynasty.
4.  The Maheshwari weaving industry flourished under her patronage, and "Maheswar Sarees & Fabric" is registered as a Geographical Indication (GI) handicraft.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's life and reign.  She was indeed born in Chondi, Ahmednagar. Her patronage extended to prominent figures like Moropant, who authored works including political commentaries on the epics.  Maheshwar became a significant center under her rule, and the Maheshwari weaving industry thrived during her time, leading to its later recognition as a GI handicraft.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  It was part of the Maratha Confederacy.
2.  Malhar Rao II played a crucial role in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.
3.  The Treaty of Mandsaur, signed after Malhar Rao II's defeat, defined relations between the Holkars and the British.
4.  Other prominent members of the Maratha Confederacy included the Bhonsle of Nagpur and the Gaekwad of Baroda.

How many of the statements above are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Holkar dynasty was a significant part of the Maratha Confederacy.  The Treaty of Mandsaur, signed after Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (not the Second), established the terms of the British-Holkar relationship.  The Bhonsle and Gaekwad families were indeed other prominent members of the Maratha Confederacy. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Malhar Rao II's involvement was in the *Third*, not the Second, Anglo-Maratha War.  This subtle inaccuracy makes the question challenging and tests detailed knowledge.


**3. Consider the following personalities:**

1. Bhagwan Mahavir
2. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar
3. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth

Which of the above personalities had their birth anniversaries or significant events recently celebrated or commemorated?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The provided text mentions the celebration of the 2550th Bhagwan Mahavir Nirvan Mahotsav, the 300th birth anniversary of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar, and the Maharashtra cabinet's decision to rename Mumbai Central station after Nana Jagannath Shankarseth—all indicating recent commemorations or celebrations related to these individuals.  Therefore, all three personalities are correct.


**4. Consider the following literary works:**

1. Ramcharitmanas
2. Panchatantra
3. Sahṛdayāloka-Locana

Which of the above works were recently included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states that manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana were included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. This makes all three options correct.  The question tests knowledge of specific literary works and their recent inclusion in a significant international register.


**5. Consider the following about the Sangam Age:**

1.  Avvaiyar was a notable female poet of the Sangam age.
2.  The social classification of Varna was unknown to Sangam poets.
3.  The twin epics Silappathigaram and Manimegalai are associated with the Sangam age.
4.  The first and third Sangams were held in Madurai, while the second was in Kapadapuram.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Avvaiyar is a well-known Sangam poet.  Silappathigaram and Manimegalai are indeed significant works from this period. The locations of the Sangams are also accurately described.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Varna system was known to Sangam poets, even though it may not have been the dominant social structure reflected in their works.  The question's difficulty stems from the inclusion of this partially true but ultimately inaccurate statement.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Harappan Civilization:**

1.  It was a Bronze Age civilization.
2. The Harappan script is fully deciphered.
3.  The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides insight into their nautical knowledge.
4.  Trade extended to Mesopotamia, with the Indus region referred to as Meluha in Mesopotamian records.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Harappan civilization was indeed a Bronze Age culture.  The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal is strong evidence of their advanced nautical understanding.  Mesopotamian records do refer to the Indus region as Meluha. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Harappan script remains undeciphered. The inclusion of this false statement amidst accurate ones makes the question more challenging.


**7. Consider the following locations:**

1. Nagapattinam
2. Kandalursalai
3. Maldives

Which of the above locations were associated with significant Chola naval expeditions?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text mentions Nagapattinam as a key trading center and Kandalursalai as a location where the Chera navy was defeated by Rajaraja.  It also notes Chola conquests extending to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.  Therefore, all three locations are correctly associated with Chola naval activities.


**8. Consider the following about the Ahom Dynasty:**

1.  It was established by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince.
2.  The Ahom kings held absolute power, unconstrained by any council.
3.  The dynasty adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement.
4.  The dynasty's downfall was linked to the Burmese invasion and subsequent British annexation.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. Sukaphaa's role in founding the dynasty, the adoption of Shaivism and Shaktism, and the Burmese invasion leading to British annexation are all historically correct.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while a monarchy, Ahom administration involved a powerful council of ministers, significantly limiting the king's absolute power.  This makes the question more difficult by including a partially correct but ultimately false statement.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty established the empire.
2.  The empire's zenith occurred under the Tuluva dynasty.
3.  The Raichur doab was acquired during the reign of Krishnadevaraya.
4.  The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors who had no military responsibilities.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct, reflecting the succession of dynasties and Krishnadevaraya's territorial expansion.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; Amara-Nayakas were military commanders given territories to govern, not merely tax collectors.  Their military roles are a crucial aspect of the Vijayanagara administrative system. This makes the question more challenging.


**10. Consider the following temples:**

1. Kedarnath Temple
2. Sangameshwar Temple
3. Kamakhya Temple

Which of the above temples are associated with Lord Shiva?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Kedarnath Temple is explicitly mentioned as one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva. Sangameshwar Temple is also dedicated to Lord Shiva.  Kamakhya Temple, however, is dedicated to Goddess Kamakhya, a Shakti deity.  Therefore, only 1 and 2 are correct.  The inclusion of Kamakhya as a distractor makes the question more demanding.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is aimed at being high, requiring precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the economic contributions of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1. She significantly promoted the Maheswari weaving industry, contributing to Maheshwar's economic growth.
2.  She established Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh as a major center for trade and commerce.
3. Her economic policies primarily focused on land reforms and agricultural development.
4. She implemented stringent tax policies to consolidate the Holkar dynasty's financial power.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic contributions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic contributions.  She is known for revitalizing the Maheswari weaving industry, making Maheshwar a significant center for textile production and trade.  Her policies also fostered the growth of Maheshwar and Indore as centers of commerce.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while she fostered economic growth, land reforms and agricultural development weren't her primary economic focus.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; her economic policies prioritized economic growth and development rather than solely focusing on consolidating power through taxation.  The question tests factual recall of her specific economic achievements and avoids generalizations.


**2. Consider the following features related to the Sangam Age in Tamil Nadu:**

1.  The social classification of Varna was prominently featured in Sangam literature.
2.  The earliest known Tamil literary work is the Silappathigaram.
3.  The Sangam poets extensively documented the practice of Vattakirutal.
4.  Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar are notable male poets of the Sangam age.

Which of the above statements are accurate representations of aspects of the Sangam Age?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Sangam literature did reflect the Varna system, although its prominence is a subject of scholarly debate.  The practice of Vattakirutal (fasting to death) is also documented. Statement 2 is incorrect; Tolkappiyam is considered the earliest known Tamil literary work, predating Silappathigaram. Statement 4 is incorrect because Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar were notable *female* poets. The question challenges candidates to accurately recall specific details and differentiate between closely related concepts.


**3. Consider the following regarding the economic policies of the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Amara-Nayakas were primarily responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining irrigation systems.
2.  The "Ayagar" system involved twelve functionaries appointed by the government in each village, with their positions remaining hereditary.
3.  "Manyas" represented lands exclusively owned by the Vijayanagara emperor.
4.  The empire's economic system relied heavily on centralized control of all aspects of production and distribution.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the economic features of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  Amara-Nayakas did have significant roles in tax collection and maintaining infrastructure like irrigation.  The Ayagar system was also a decentralized village-level administrative structure with hereditary positions.  Statement 3 is partially incorrect; while "Manyas" were tax-free lands, they were not exclusively owned by the emperor but granted to temples and other institutions.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Vijayanagara economy involved a complex system of decentralized administration alongside centralized control, not a complete reliance on centralized control.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the empire's administrative and economic structures.


**4. Consider the following about the  impact of the Odisha Famine of 1866:**

1.  The famine is also known as the "Na-Anka Famine" due to its occurrence during the ninth regnal year of Gajapati Divyasinghadeva.
2.  Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, the Commissioner of the Odisha division, is largely credited with effectively mitigating the famine's impact.
3.  The construction of the Puri Canal, connecting the Hooghly River to the Matai River, was a direct consequence of the famine.
4. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw's response to the famine included establishing numerous vernacular schools with an emphasis on the Odia language.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the consequences and impact of the Odisha Famine of 1866?


(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The famine's alternate name and its connection to the regnal year are accurate. The construction of the Puri Canal was a direct response to the crisis. Ravenshaw's establishment of vernacular schools is also well-documented. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Ravenshaw's role is often viewed as controversial, with his actions seen by some as contributing to the severity of the famine rather than mitigating it.  The question tests nuanced understanding of historical events and the ability to differentiate between fact and interpretation.


**5. Consider the following about the individuals associated with the Ramakrishna Mission and its related activities:**

1. Swami Vivekananda is credited with delivering a renowned address at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago.
2.  Swami Vivekananda played a significant role in establishing the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
3.  The Ramakrishna Mission primarily focuses on religious instruction and missionary work.
4.  The Ramakrishna Mission is involved in diverse social service initiatives, including running hospitals and educational institutions.


Which of the above statements correctly reflect the contributions and activities associated with Swami Vivekananda and the Ramakrishna Mission?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. Swami Vivekananda's Chicago address is historically significant. The Ramakrishna Mission's involvement in social service is also well-known. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while Vivekananda inspired Jamsetji Tata, his direct role in establishing the IISc is not as strongly established. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Mission's activities extend far beyond religious instruction, encompassing various social service initiatives.  This question tests knowledge of historical figures and the complexities of their associated organizations.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the facts and the ability to analyze and differentiate between closely related concepts.  They avoid simple recall and demand a higher level of cognitive engagement, aligning with the expectations of a challenging UPSC exam.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult' by incorporating closely related distractors and demanding precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval power:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in its annexation as a Chola province.
3.  The Chola Empire's naval dominance extended their influence across the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
4.  Nagapattinam served as a major trading center, facilitated by the Chola navy's control of the Bay of Bengal.
5.  The Chola navy's "Look East Policy" focused primarily on military conquest, neglecting trade relations.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate reflections of the Chola Empire's naval power. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I significantly expanded Chola naval dominance through conquests and control of key trade routes.  Nagapattinam's importance as a trading center is well-documented, a direct consequence of their naval strength. The Chola's influence extended across Southeast Asia, encompassing military and trade relations.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the Chola "Look East Policy" was a combination of military expansion and trade, mutually reinforcing each other.  The empire's naval power was instrumental in both.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to Indian cultural heritage:**

1.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, supported by Azerbaijan, focuses on the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.
2.  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register recently included manuscripts of the *Panchatantra* and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*.
3.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) plans to delist several "untraceable" centrally protected monuments, citing a lack of national importance.
4.  Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, aims to democratize art through public installations, featuring diverse Indian art forms like Thangka painting.

Which of the above statements correctly describe initiatives concerning the preservation and promotion of Indian cultural heritage?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe initiatives related to Indian cultural heritage. The Transhumance Initiative highlights intangible cultural heritage; the MOW Register preserves literary works; the ASI's delisting reflects a reassessment of national importance; and Project PARI promotes public art. Statement 5 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not formally defined in the AMASR Act, 1958,  it originated from CAG Audit reports.


**3. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty marked the empire's decline.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab and military successes against Orissa and Bijapur.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors with limited military responsibilities.
4.  The Virupaksha Temple and Vithala Temple Complex are among the empire's architectural marvels.
5.  Krishnadevaraya's court included the "Ashtadiggajaru," eight scholars of diverse fields.
6.  The 'Ayagar' system involved village-level functionaries appointed for life terms.

How many of the above statements accurately characterize aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, 5, and 6 are accurate. Krishnadevaraya's reign was a high point, the temples are famous landmarks, the Ashtadiggajaru were influential scholars, and the Ayagar system describes village-level administration. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sangama Dynasty *founded* the empire, its decline was later. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; while Amara-Nayakas collected taxes, they also held significant military command and controlled territories.

2.  The Anubhav Awards recognize the experiences of retiring central government employees, shared on the Anubhav Portal.
3.  The Bharat Ratna is recommended by the President of India.
4.  The Gallantry Awards include the Param Vir Chakra, Ashoka Chakra, and Vir Chakra, with the Param Vir Chakra having the highest precedence.
5.  Satyajit Ray, Amitabh Bachchan, and Rajinikanth are recipients of the Padma Shri.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of Indian awards and honors?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. Padma Awards are typically not posthumous but exceptions exist. The Anubhav Awards are based on employee experiences. The order of Gallantry Awards is accurate, and the listed personalities have received Padma Awards. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Bharat Ratna is recommended by the Prime Minister, not the President.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the delisting of monuments by the ASI:**

1.  The ASI's delisting of monuments is based on assessments of their national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, explicitly defines the term "Missing Monuments."
3.  Kos Minar No.13 in Haryana is among the monuments facing delisting.
4.  Delisting removes ASI conservation and protection, allowing for regular construction activities in the area.
5.  Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments of national importance.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the process and implications of delisting centrally protected monuments in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct.  The ASI's decision is based on assessments of national importance; Kos Minar is mentioned as an example; delisting removes ASI protection; and Article 49 mandates the protection of nationally important monuments. Statement 2 is incorrect; the AMASR Act does not formally define "Missing Monuments."  This term emerged from CAG audit reports.


**1. Consider the following statements about the delisting of centrally protected monuments in India:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision to delist a monument on its assessment of national importance.
2.  The AMASR Act, 1958, defines the term "Missing Monuments".
3. Kos Minar No. 13 in Haryana is among the monuments slated for delisting.
4. Delisting a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, allows for regular construction and urbanization activities in the area.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's decision to delist a monument is based on its assessment of whether the monument lacks national importance.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined in the AMASR Act, 1958; it emerged from CAG audit reports. Statement 3 is correct; Kos Minar No. 13 is indeed listed among the monuments under consideration for delisting. Statement 4 is correct. Delisting under Section 35 removes ASI protection and maintenance, opening the way for construction and urbanization.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Padma Awards:**

1. They were instituted in 1954.
2. They are conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases.
3. The awards are given in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.
4.  Recipients can use the award as a suffix or prefix to their name.

Which of the above statements are accurate concerning Padma Awards?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954, and they are given in three categories as stated. Statement 2 is also correct; while generally not given posthumously, exceptions are made in highly deserving cases. Statement 4 is incorrect.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It was primarily a Hindu reformist movement, as perceived by Mahatma Gandhi.
2.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) viewed it solely as a fight against caste-based atrocities.
3.  The movement resulted in the immediate and complete opening of all roads leading to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes.
4.  The Satyagraha lasted for over 600 days.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Gandhi did support the movement,  Periyar's perspective highlighted its broader implications against caste oppression.  Statement 2 is correct; Periyar's critique reflects his distinct approach to social reform. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Satyagraha achieved partial success; only three of the four roads were opened.  Statement 4 is correct; the movement's duration was indeed over 600 days. Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuanced perspectives on the Vaikom Satyagraha and its outcomes, highlighting the differing viewpoints of Gandhi and Periyar.  The inclusion of statement 3 as a distractor is crucial as it plays on a common misconception about the movement's complete success.


**2. Consider the following regarding the individuals associated with the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  T.K. Madhavan was a key figure in initiating the campaign to lift the ban on temple entry.
2.  K.P. Kesava Menon played a significant role in the early stages of the movement.
3.  George Joseph led the movement throughout its duration.
4.  Nagammai, Periyar's wife, actively participated and empowered women within the movement.


Which of the above statements correctly identify individuals involved in the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. T.K. Madhavan was instrumental in raising the issue of temple entry and leading the campaign. K.P. Kesava Menon was a prominent figure in the initial phases. Nagammai's active participation is well documented.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While George Joseph did assume leadership at a point, he did not lead the entire duration of the Satyagraha.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key figures and their roles in the movement, demanding precise factual recall.  The inclusion of George Joseph as a distractor is important, as he was involved but not in the capacity described.


**3. Consider the following concerning the legal and social reforms following the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936 granted access to lower-caste individuals to temples.
2.  The Travancore Public Service Commission was established to ensure fairness in government appointments.
3.  The Vaikom Satyagraha directly led to the immediate abolition of the caste system in Travancore.
4.  The movement prompted the immediate implementation of universal adult suffrage in Travancore.

Which of the above were direct consequences or outcomes of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect outcomes. The Temple Entry Proclamation was a significant legal victory, and the establishment of the Public Service Commission aimed at social justice. Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.  While the Satyagraha contributed to broader social change, it did not lead to the immediate abolition of the caste system or universal adult suffrage. The question assesses the candidate's ability to distinguish between direct and indirect consequences of the movement, highlighting the long-term impact versus immediate changes.  The inclusion of options 3 and 4 serves as plausible distractors, tempting candidates to overestimate the immediate impact of the Satyagraha.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Kakori Train Action:**

1.  It was orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
2.  The primary objective was to fund revolutionary activities through the robbery.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Kakori Train Action?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The HRA planned and executed the action, aiming to finance revolutionary activities.  Bismil and Khan were prominent participants. Statement 3 is incorrect; the action took place in Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal. This question tests knowledge of a specific historical event, its actors, and its location.  The incorrect statement about the location is a carefully chosen distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the event's geography.


**5. Consider the following about the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:**

1. It empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance.
2.  The Act defines the term "Missing Monuments."

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions and implications of the AMASR Act, 1958, and its relation to constitutional provisions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Act allows delisting, Article 49 provides constitutional backing for monument protection, and the Act covers excavations and artifacts. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act does not define "Missing Monuments"—that term emerged later in CAG reports.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of a specific legal framework, its powers, and its relationship with constitutional provisions.  The incorrect statement about "Missing Monuments" serves as a key distractor, requiring in-depth knowledge of the Act and its interpretations.

(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3 are correct. The initiative utilizes local ambassadors and empowers women and youth. Statement 2 is incorrect; the initiative covers a range of destinations, not just urban areas. Statement 4 is incorrect; while luxury tourism is part of the tourism sector, the program's focus is broader than that.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of a specific government initiative, its objectives, and its target groups.  The inclusion of statements 2 and 4 acts as distractors, ensuring that the candidate has a precise understanding of the initiative's scope and focus.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features and objectives of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The initiative involves multiple stakeholders, seeks to boost global competitiveness, and utilizes TEXPROCIL for implementation.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the quality is high, the initiative's focus isn't solely on organic cotton.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of a specific government program in the textile sector, its participants, and its aims.  The distractor focuses on the type of cotton, requiring a precise understanding of the initiative's scope.

How many of the above changes accurately reflect the modifications made to the Lady Justice statue?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The saree represents Indian tradition, the open eyes symbolize justice's awareness, and the scales maintain the concept of impartiality. Statement 3 is incorrect; the sword was replaced with the Indian Constitution, not a gavel. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of symbolic changes in a significant national monument and their interpretation.  The incorrect statement about the gavel provides a plausible but inaccurate alternative, demanding detailed knowledge of the specific changes.


**9. Consider the following about the  contributions of India to the South African Anti-Apartheid Struggle:**

1. Mahatma Gandhi's early activism in South Africa laid the groundwork for anti-colonial and anti-racial movements.
2.  Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo was a prominent leader of the African National Congress (ANC).

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Gandhi's early activism is well-known, India was among the early countries to impose sanctions, and India provided significant support to the ANC. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Dadoo was a prominent anti-apartheid activist, he wasn't directly within the ANC leadership. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of India's role in an important international movement, requiring knowledge of key figures and actions.  The distractor focuses on a specific individual's precise role, demanding detailed knowledge of the historical context.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Santhal Rebellion:**

1.  The rebellion took place in the Rajmahal Hills.
2.  Siddho and Kanho were among the key leaders of the rebellion.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Santhal Rebellion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The rebellion's location, leaders, causes, and Marx's assessment are all accurately described. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific historical rebellion, its causes, and its significance. There are no distractors in this specific question, as all statements are factual.  The question's difficulty lies in the candidate's ability to recall multiple facts about a particular historical event.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Kasturi Cotton Bharat:**

1. It is a joint initiative involving the Ministry of Textiles and the Cotton Corporation of India.
2. Blockchain technology is used for ensuring 100% traceability and certification.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of Kasturi Cotton Bharat.  It is indeed a joint initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Textiles, in collaboration with the Cotton Corporation of India, and various trade bodies and industry stakeholders.  Blockchain technology forms a core component of the initiative, ensuring complete traceability and certification of the cotton from farm to final product.  TEXPROCIL serves as the implementing agency, overseeing the project's execution and achieving its objectives. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The initiative focuses on Indian cotton, not silk.  The aim is to improve the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through branding, traceability, and certification, creating a sustainable ecosystem for the industry.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Project PARI:**

1. It is an initiative of the Ministry of Culture.
2. Its primary goal is to promote the sale of art through online platforms.
3. Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are involved in its execution.

How many of the statements accurately describe Project PARI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Project PARI is indeed an initiative under the Ministry of Culture, aiming to democratize art through public installations.  Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art are key players in the project's implementation. The project showcases a diverse range of Indian art forms including Thangka, Cheriyal, Bani Thani, and Alpana paintings, among others, through public installations. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The project's focus is not on online sales but on making art accessible to the public in urban landscapes, transforming public spaces into accessible galleries. Hence, only three statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative:**

1. It aims to improve the tourist experience through trained local ambassadors.
2. Its primary focus is on promoting luxury tourism experiences.
3. The initiative is implemented across all 50 states in India.

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative focuses on enhancing the tourist experience by training local individuals, particularly women and youth, to act as friendly ambassadors and storytellers for their destinations.  This aligns with statements 1 and 4.  The initiative aims to provide tourism-related training and awareness, developing new tourism products and experiences.  Statement 2 is incorrect as it does not specifically focus on luxury tourism, but rather aims to improve the overall tourist experience. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the initiative is implemented across 50 tourist destinations, not all 50 states. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately describe the initiative.


**4. Consider the following about the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI:**

1. The decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture.
2. The delisting process is governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI is indeed based on a report from the Ministry of Culture (statement 1). The legal framework for delisting is outlined in Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958 (statement 2). Article 49 of the Constitution mandates the protection of monuments of national importance (statement 4). However, statement 3 is incorrect. "Missing monuments" is not a formally recognized term within the AMASR Act; it emerged from CAG audit reports. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe the legal and procedural aspects.

1. It depicts Lady Justice in Western attire.
2. It features a blindfold to symbolize impartiality.

How many of the above features are accurate representations of the new statue?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court reflects a move towards decoloniality.  Statements 3 and 4 are accurate; the sword is replaced with the Indian Constitution, symbolizing the Constitution's supremacy, and the scales represent the impartial weighing of evidence.  Statement 4 remains true; the scales are retained to signify the court's impartial judgment. However, statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The statue depicts Lady Justice in a saree, not Western attire, and the blindfold has been removed, symbolizing that justice is not blind but sees equally.  Therefore, only three of the listed features are accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Nalanda University:**

2. It was established based on a decision made during the first East Asia Summit.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 4 are correct. The new Nalanda University campus is indeed located near the ancient ruins in Rajgir, Bihar. The ancient Nalanda University boasted a massive library known as "Dharma Gunj."  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the decision to establish the modern Nalanda University was made at the *second*, not first, East Asia Summit.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the ancient Nalanda University had strong Buddhist connections, its curriculum encompassed a wide range of subjects including Vedas, various schools of Buddhism, fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and warfare.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following about the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. It was a non-violent protest against the exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from a temple.

4. E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a significant role in mobilizing support.

How many of the statements accurately describe the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vaikom Satyagraha was a non-violent movement protesting against caste-based discrimination preventing lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple (statement 1).  T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan were indeed prominent leaders (statement 2), and E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) played a crucial role in the movement's success (statement 4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Vaikom Satyagraha occurred within the context of the broader Indian independence movement, its primary focus was on addressing caste-based social injustice and temple entry rights, not directly on achieving complete political independence.  Therefore, three of the statements correctly describe the Vaikom Satyagraha.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Santhal Rebellion:**

1. It was led by Siddho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav, along with sisters Phulo and Jhano.
2. The rebellion primarily took place in the Rajmahal Hills.

How many of the statements accurately reflect aspects of the Santhal Rebellion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The Santhal Rebellion was indeed led by the figures mentioned, took place in the Rajmahal Hills, and resulted in the enactment of the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876. However, statement 3 is incorrect. Karl Marx referred to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution, but against the British colonial authorities, not the Mughal Empire (which had ended long before). Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements related to the Flag Code of India, 2002:**

1. It governs the display of the National Flag by private, public, and government institutions.
2. The 2022 amendment allows for the display of the National Flag only during national holidays.
3. The National Flag can be made of hand-spun and hand-woven cotton or polyester.
4. The Flag's length-to-height ratio must be 3:2.

How many of these statements accurately reflect provisions of the Flag Code?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Flag Code does govern the display of the National Flag across various sectors.  The 2021 amendment allows for the use of hand-spun and hand-woven or machine-made cotton, polyester, wool, silk, or Ichadi bunting. The 3:2 length-to-height ratio is a mandatory requirement. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2022 amendment allows for the display of the National Flag on all days and nights, not just national holidays. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the "Abhaya Mudra":**

1. It is a symbol of fearlessness.
2. It is primarily associated with the Buddha.
3.  It depicts the Buddha in a seated meditative posture.
4.  It is displayed by the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi.

How many of these statements accurately describe the Abhaya Mudra?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Abhaya Mudra is indeed a symbol of fearlessness, associated with the Buddha, and specifically displayed by Amoghasiddhi, one of the five Dhyani Buddhas. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Abhaya Mudra is a hand gesture, it does not depict the Buddha in a seated meditative posture;  that would be the Dhyana Mudra.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the Abhaya Mudra.



**1. Consider the following statements about the Padma Awards:**

2. They are awarded posthumously in exceptional cases.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Padma Awards were indeed instituted in 1954, and they are conferred in three categories as stated. Statement 2 is also correct; while not typically awarded posthumously, exceptions are made in highly deserving cases. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The Padma Awards do not constitute a title and cannot be used as a prefix or suffix to a recipient's name.  This is a crucial point often overlooked, highlighting the difference between honorary awards and titles of nobility.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Anubhav Awards:**

1. They are given by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. They are based on write-ups submitted on the Anubhav portal.
3. Their aim is to promote better governance.
4. They are exclusively for serving government employees.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct.  The Anubhav Awards are indeed based on write-ups from the Anubhav portal, and their aim is to foster better governance and administrative reforms.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; they are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Statement 4 is also incorrect as the awards are for *retiring* central government employees/pensioners, not exclusively serving ones. Thus, only two statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following about Gallantry Awards:**

1. The Param Vir Chakra is the highest gallantry award.
2. They are announced only on Republic Day.
3. The Ashoka Chakra is awarded for wartime bravery.
4. The Vir Chakra was instituted before the Maha Vir Chakra.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Param Vir Chakra holds the highest position in the order of precedence for gallantry awards. Statement 3 is also correct; the Ashoka Chakra is awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy. However, statement 2 is incorrect. Gallantry awards are announced twice a year – on Republic Day and Independence Day. Statement 4 is also incorrect. While both awards are for wartime bravery, the Maha Vir Chakra was instituted in 1950, before the Vir Chakra.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following features of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative:**

1. It aims to improve tourist experiences through local guides.
2. It focuses exclusively on training experienced tourism professionals.

4. It prioritizes training only men for tourism-related roles.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 and 3 are correct. The initiative aims to enhance tourist experiences by providing trained local guides and storytellers, aligning with the vision of showcasing Incredible India through its people. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The initiative specifically emphasizes training women and youth, not just experienced professionals. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it specifically focuses on training women and youth.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Geographical Indications (GI) tags:**

1. The GI Registry is located in Mumbai.
2. GI tags are granted for products from various Indian states.
3. GI tags protect the geographical origin of products.
4.  GI tags guarantee the quality of products.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. GI tags are indeed granted for products from various Indian states, and they protect the geographical origin and associated reputation of the products. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GI Registry is located in Chennai, not Mumbai.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while GI tags protect the origin, they do not inherently guarantee a certain level of quality.  Quality control remains a separate issue.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.



**6. Consider the following regarding the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court:**

1. It is inspired by Greek and Roman mythology.
2. It depicts Lady Justice wearing a blindfold.
3. The sword is replaced with the Indian Constitution.
4. It wears Western attire.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The new statue's design draws inspiration from Greek and Roman mythology, representing Justitia, and notably replaces the traditional sword with the Indian Constitution.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the blindfold has been removed, symbolizing a departure from the traditional depiction of blind justice.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the statue now wears a saree, reflecting Indian traditions. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following about the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI:**

1. The decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture.
2.  “Missing Monuments” is a term defined in the AMASR Act, 1958.
3. Delisting means the monument loses ASI protection and maintenance.
4. Article 49 of the Constitution mandates the protection of all ancient monuments.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The decision to delist monuments is indeed based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, and delisting results in the loss of ASI protection and maintenance.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; “Missing Monuments” is not a term formally defined in the AMASR Act, 1958.  Statement 4 is also not entirely accurate; while Article 49 directs the state to protect monuments of national importance, it doesn't mandate the protection of *all* ancient monuments. The ASI's assessment of national importance is crucial here. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following about the Bharat Ratna Award:**

1. It was established by the first President of India.
2. Recipients are prohibited from using the award as a title.
3. It is awarded only to Indian citizens.
4.  It carries a substantial monetary grant.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Bharat Ratna was indeed established by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, and recipients cannot use it as a title or prefix/suffix to their names.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the award is open to non-Indians as well.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Bharat Ratna does not include any monetary grant.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

1. It was led primarily by Mahatma Gandhi.
2. It aimed to secure temple entry for lower-caste individuals.

4. It saw complete agreement between Gandhi and Periyar.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed focused on securing temple entry for lower castes, and it did contribute to the landmark Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; while Gandhi supported the movement, it was primarily led by figures like T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the movement highlighted a significant rift in opinion between Gandhi and Periyar regarding its nature and scope. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following about the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA):**

1.  The Kakori train action was its most prominent event.
2. Its main objective was to assassinate Lord Irwin.
3. Ram Prasad Bismil was a key figure in the HRA.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Kakori train action was indeed a defining event for the HRA, and Ram Prasad Bismil was a prominent figure involved. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the HRA's objective in the Kakori train action was to rob the train to fund revolutionary activities, not to assassinate Lord Irwin.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the HRA was known for its revolutionary activities, which included armed actions and was not focused on non-violent methods. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**11. Consider the following regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. The Sangama dynasty was its founding dynasty.
2. Krishnadevaraya's rule marked its decline.
3.  Amara-Nayakas were military governors who controlled territories.
4.  The empire's capital was located in present-day Karnataka.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Sangama dynasty did found the Vijayanagara Empire, Amara-Nayakas were its military governors, and its core territories were located in present-day Karnataka. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Krishnadevaraya's rule marked the empire's *zenith*, not its decline.  The decline occurred later, after the Tuluva dynasty. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**12. Consider the following about the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme:**

1. It was launched in 1990.
2. It has registers at the international, regional and national levels.
3. It aims to preserve global documentary heritage.
4.  It is primarily focused on preserving digital archives.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The MoW Programme does maintain registers at different levels and aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it was launched in 1992, not 1990. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while it includes digital materials, its scope is broader than just digital archives, encompassing various forms of documentary heritage. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

1.  Ramcharitmanas is a 17th-century epic poem in Sanskrit.
2.  Panchatantra is known for its 'story within story' structure.
3.  Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is a text on Indian poetics.
4.  All three works were written in the same language.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Panchatantra is indeed well-known for its nested storytelling, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is a significant text on Indian poetics. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Ramcharitmanas is a 16th-century epic poem written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the three works were written in different languages (Awadhi, Sanskrit, and Sanskrit respectively).  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**14. Consider the following statements about the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship:**

1.  It is awarded by the Sahitya Akademi.
2.  It is the highest honour conferred by the Akademi.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The fellowship is indeed awarded by the Sahitya Akademi, it is its highest honour, and Ruskin Bond is a recipient.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the fellowship is not limited to poets but is open to writers across various genres.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The IAD does commemorate the Buddha's descent from the celestial realm, and it is observed by the Ministry of Culture in association with the International Buddhist Confederation. However, statement 3 is incorrect; it is celebrated in Sankisa Basantapur, Uttar Pradesh, not Bodh Gaya.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; it does not mark the beginning of the Buddhist calendar. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**16. Consider the following about the World Crafts Council (WCCI):**

1. It was founded in 1965.
2. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was one of its founders.
3. Its headquarters are permanently located in New York.
4. It is affiliated with UNESCO.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 is correct. The Keeladi excavations have indeed revealed evidence of Sangam-age urban settlements. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it is located on the banks of the Vaigai River, not the Cauvery. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the excavations began in 2015, not 2016.  While the site reveals evidence of various industries, statement 4 is not explicitly supported by readily available information about the site's discoveries.  Therefore, only one statement is definitively correct.


**18. Consider the following about Classical Languages in India:**

1.  Tamil was declared a Classical Language in 2005.
2.  The criteria for declaring a language as Classical were revised in 2024.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct.

Statement 3 is also incorrect; Prakrit is not itself declared a Classical Language but is an important language family related to the Classical languages. Therefore, only two statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and application.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why the other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power:**

1.  Control over the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.
2.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
3.  The annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
4.  The establishment of Nagapattinam as a key trading center.
5.  Extensive conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra under Rajendra I.

How many of the above accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval strength and expansion?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five statements accurately depict aspects of the Chola Empire's naval dominance and territorial expansion.  The Chola navy controlled the Bay of Bengal, making it a crucial player in the maritime trade routes to Southeast Asia (a).  Their naval prowess is evidenced by the defeat of the Chera navy (b).  Sri Lanka's partial annexation (c) and Nagapattinam's status as a major trading hub (d) both highlight the empire's maritime influence. Finally, Rajendra I's conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (e) represent a significant expansion of Chola power across Southeast Asia.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of these statements regarding the Chola maritime activities.


**2. Consider the following features of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  Extensive use of standardized weights and measures.
2.  The presence of a pictographic script, yet to be deciphered.
3.  The worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), and a female Mother Goddess.
4.  The absence of discovered temples, despite evidence of religious practices.
5.  The development of advanced bronze casting techniques, including the "lost wax" method.

How many of the above characteristics accurately reflect the key aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  All five statements correctly describe significant features of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). The IVC displayed a remarkable degree of standardization in weights and measures, suggesting a well-organized and interconnected society (1).  While the script remains undeciphered, its pictographic nature is well-established (2). The worship of Pasupati and the Mother Goddess reveals aspects of their religious beliefs (3). The absence of discovered temples, despite evidence of rituals, is a notable characteristic, suggesting the possibility of different forms of religious practice (4). Finally, their mastery of bronze casting, particularly the "lost wax" technique, showcases their advanced metallurgical skills (5).


**3. Consider the following about the Ahom Dynasty:**

1.  Establishment by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince from Mong Mao.
2.  A strong centralized monarchy with absolute power vested in the king.
3.  Adoption of Shaivism and the Shakti movement, leading to temple construction.
4.  The downfall of the dynasty resulting from the Burmese invasion and subsequent British annexation.
5.  The use of the Patkai Mountains as a primary route for migration from Yunnan province.

How many of the listed statements correctly describe significant aspects of the Ahom Dynasty?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Four of the statements accurately reflect key features of the Ahom Dynasty. Sukaphaa's founding role (1) and the dynasty's eventual fall due to Burmese invasion and British annexation (4) are historical facts.  The Ahoms adopted and patronized Shaivism and the Shakti cult, building numerous temples (3). However, statement (2) is incorrect; the Ahom administration, while a monarchy,  had significant power vested in the Council of Ministers (Patra Mantris). A king's appointment required their concurrence. Statement (5) is also inaccurate; while they migrated from Yunnan province, the Patkai Mountains were a barrier they crossed, not a primary migration route.


**4. Consider the following regarding Transhumance:**

1. It is a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement.
2. It exclusively involves the movement of livestock, not human communities.
3. Transhumance landscapes in India are primarily found in the Himalayan region.
4.  Two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023.
5. It's a practice prevalent only in mountainous regions, not in plains.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly describe transhumance.  Transhumance is indeed a traditional seasonal livestock movement (1), involving human communities migrating alongside their herds.  India's Himalayan regions are significant areas where transhumance occurs (3), and in 2023, two related traditions received intangible heritage status (4).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; transhumance involves the movement of both livestock and human communities.  Statement 5 is also inaccurate; while prevalent in mountainous areas, transhumance also exists in plains regions of India.


**5. Consider the following related to the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty marked the empire's initial establishment.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw territorial expansion to the Raichur doab and conquests in Orissa.
3.  The Aravidu Dynasty was characterized by internal stability and external dominance.
4.  The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors with no military responsibilities.
5.  The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi is a significant architectural marvel of the empire.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Three statements accurately describe the Vijayanagara Empire. The Sangama Dynasty founded the empire (1), and Krishnadevaraya's reign was a period of significant expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab and campaigns against Orissa (2).  The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi stands as a testament to their architectural achievements (5). However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Aravidu Dynasty faced considerable internal conflict and external pressure. Statement 4 is also inaccurate; the Amara-Nayakas were military commanders granted territories to govern, collecting taxes while also maintaining military forces.


**6. Consider the following concerning prehistoric rock art in India:**

1.  The earliest paintings are from the Upper Paleolithic period, featuring animals and stick-like human figures.
2.  Mesolithic paintings predominantly depict hunting scenes and community dances.

4.  Bhimbetka and Jwalapuram are significant sites for Upper Paleolithic rock art.
5.  The Chambal region and Daimabad are associated with Neolithic-Chalcolithic rock art.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of prehistoric rock paintings in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four statements correctly describe aspects of prehistoric Indian rock art.  The Upper Paleolithic period did indeed feature the earliest known paintings, often depicting animals and simple human forms (1). Mesolithic art frequently showed hunting and communal activities (2). Bhimbetka and Jwalapuram are key Upper Paleolithic sites (4), and the Chambal region and Daimabad are associated with Neolithic-Chalcolithic art (5). However, statement 3 is incorrect; Neolithic-Chalcolithic paintings generally show a decline in the vividness and vitality seen in earlier periods.


**7. Consider the following regarding the  UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The MOW program was launched in 1992.

5.  The register only includes manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) program and its Asia-Pacific Register?


(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four statements accurately describe the MOW program and its Asia-Pacific Register. The program's 1992 launch (1) and its three-tiered registration system (2) are correct.  The inclusion of the mentioned Indian manuscripts in the Asia-Pacific Register (3) and the location of the 10th MOWCAP meeting (4) are also accurate.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; while the question refers to the *Asia-Pacific* register, the MOW program encompasses global heritage, and registers exist beyond that specific region.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require detailed knowledge of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1. Rajaraja Chola's naval victories included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquest extended to the entire island of Sri Lanka, making it a Chola province.
3.  Rajendra I's major naval expedition targeted the Pandya kingdom in South India.
4.  Nagapattinam served as a significant trading center during the Chola period.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion. Rajaraja Chola's naval dominance is well-documented, including his decisive victory over the Cheras at Kandalursalai.  Rajendra I further expanded the empire's reach through naval campaigns, resulting in the complete annexation of Sri Lanka. Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading hub during this era is also a well-established historical fact. Statement 3 is incorrect; Rajendra I's major naval expeditions targeted regions beyond South India, notably the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia, not the Pandya kingdom.  The inclusion of this incorrect statement serves as a plausible distractor, requiring careful evaluation of each statement's accuracy.


**2. Consider the following regarding the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative:**

1. The initiative is primarily led by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
2. Transhumance involves the seasonal movement of livestock and associated human communities.
3.  The practice of transhumance is largely confined to the Himalayan region of India.
4.  In 2023, transhumance traditions in both Europe and the Americas were recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately defines transhumance.  Statement 4 correctly identifies the recognition of transhumance traditions in Europe (specifically mentioned in the text) as Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while UNESCO is involved in preserving cultural heritage, the initiative is led by ICOMOS. Statement 3 is inaccurate;  the text explicitly mentions transhumance practices in both the Himalayas and plains regions of India, indicating a wider geographical spread than solely the Himalayas. The incorrect options include plausible distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the initiative's leadership, geographical reach, and the specific year of recognition.



**3. Consider the following about UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian works included in the register.
2. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Beijing, China.
3. The MOW program maintains only an International Register.
4. The MOW program was launched in 1990.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly lists the three Indian literary works included in the register. Statement 2 is incorrect; the meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Statement 3 is incorrect; the MOW program maintains International, Regional, and National Registers. Statement 4 is incorrect; the program was launched in 1992, not 1990.  The inclusion of these factually close yet incorrect statements makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the MOW program's details.



**4. Consider the following statements related to the Sangameswar Temple:**

1. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2. The temple's name derives from its location at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers.
3.  The Chalukya dynasty is credited with the temple's construction.
4.  Other Sangameswar temples are located only in Andhra Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The temple's name reflects its location at the confluence of rivers, and the Chalukya dynasty's involvement in its construction is mentioned in the text. Statement 1 is incorrect; the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Statement 4 is incorrect; the text explicitly mentions Sangameswar temples in other states like Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.  The inclusion of these geographically and religiously related distractors enhances the question's difficulty level.



**5. Consider the following features of the Kamakhya Temple:**

1. It is located on the Nilachal hills in Assam.
2.  The Koch dynasty played a significant role in its reconstruction.
3.  Its architecture primarily reflects the Dravidian style.
4.  The Ambubachi Mela festival commemorates a yearly event associated with the goddess.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The temple's location, the Koch dynasty's role in its reconstruction, and the Ambubachi Mela's commemoration are all accurately described. Statement 3 is incorrect; the temple's architecture is a blend of Nilachal, Upper Burma, Pala, and Ahom styles – a complex fusion, not solely Dravidian.  The deliberate inclusion of an architectural style as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the temple's unique architectural history.


**6. Consider the following about the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  Mohenjo-daro yielded a steatite statue interpreted as a priest.
2.  The Indus script is a fully deciphered pictographic script.

These questions test a range of cognitive skills, demanding factual recall, analysis, and evaluation of historical information.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, making the questions challenging and suitable for a high-stakes exam like the UPSC.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.

(a) Only one

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866 was indeed known as the 'Na-Anka Famine',  Ravenshaw did establish vernacular schools, and the Puri Canal was constructed in the aftermath. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the negligence of British administrators was a contributing factor, the famine's causes were multifaceted, encompassing natural disasters and economic factors as well.  Attributing the cause solely to administrative negligence is an oversimplification of a complex historical event.

However, statement 1 is incorrect. The Mahabodhi Temple's architecture is a unique blend of influences, it is not purely Dravidian.  It shows elements that are similar to both Nagara and Dravidian styles.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Blockchain technology is a core component, and TEXPROCIL is the implementing agency.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; it's a joint initiative involving multiple stakeholders, not solely the Ministry of Textiles. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the initiative aims for a sustainable ecosystem, but not one that is entirely government-controlled.  It emphasizes self-regulation by industry bodies.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Article 49 does direct the state to protect such monuments, and the Act allows for delisting.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Act does not define "Missing Monuments"; this term emerged later in CAG audit reports. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act covers both monuments and other archaeological remains.

How many of the above statements correctly identify the characteristics or history of ancient Indian universities?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three

Odantapuri's establishment in the 8th century and its attraction for Tibetan scholars are also historically accurate. Nagarjunakonda's connection to Nagarjuna and its importance as a Buddhist center are also factual.  However, statement 2 is partially inaccurate; while Nalanda was a major Buddhist center, it is not exclusively associated with Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism; other schools of Buddhist thought also flourished there.  Statement 5 is also inaccurate; while Valabhi existed, its primary association was not exclusively with Hindu philosophy; it was known for a diverse range of studies.

The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi is dedicated to Lord Shiva and exemplifies Dravida architecture. The Kamakhya Temple in Assam is correctly identified as a Shakti Peetha and a center of Tantric worship. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Sangameswar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while the Alagar Temple is mentioned in Silappadikaram, it is dedicated to Lord Vishnu (as Kallazhagar), not Shiva. Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate.

**Explanation:**

Four statements accurately describe elements of the Vijayanagara Empire.  The Sangama Dynasty's founding role is well-established. Krishnadevaraya's reign did see territorial expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab. The Amara-Nayakas were indeed powerful military commanders who governed territories, though their role extended beyond mere tax collection; they had significant administrative and military responsibilities. The 'Ayagar' system was a vital component of village administration.  Hampi's status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site is also correct.  Statement 4 is slightly misleading as the Amara Nayaks were not just tax collectors, but powerful regional governors.  Therefore, four statements are correct.

(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Four statements accurately reflect aspects of Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's life and work. His Brahmin background and birthplace in Thane district are correct. His admiration for and influence from Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy is also documented. His contributions to Mumbai's urban planning are significant, shaping its infrastructure. His patronage of education, especially for girls, is also well-known.  However, statement 5 is not explicitly supported by readily available information; while he was a philanthropist, his contributions to the textile industry are not as prominently documented compared to his other achievements.

**Explanation:**

Four statements are correct. The MoW Programme's launch year, its three-tiered register system, its preservation goals, and public awareness initiatives are all accurate. The inclusion of the mentioned Indian literary works in the Asia-Pacific register is also true.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; while UNESCO is heavily involved, the MoW Programme is not solely managed by UNESCO; it involves collaboration with numerous national and regional organizations.

**Explanation:**

The existence of temples in Telangana and Karnataka is also accurate.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; Sangameswar Temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while many are located in South India, the distribution is not exclusive to that region.  Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate.

Rajendra Chola I's expansion into Southeast Asia is also historically accurate. Nagapattinam's importance as a port city is also well-known.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; while the Cholas had a strong land army, their naval power was equally crucial to their territorial expansion and control of trade routes.  Therefore, only four statements are correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Vijayanagara Empire was established by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I of the Sangama dynasty. Statement 2 is also correct.  Krishnadevaraya's reign (1509-1529) was a period of significant expansion for the empire.  His military campaigns resulted in the acquisition of the Raichur doab and victories over Orissa and Bijapur. Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading. While Amara-Nayakas were military commanders given territories to rule, they collected taxes and retained a portion of the revenue.  However, their positions, while often hereditary, were ultimately granted by the Raya (king) and were not strictly hereditary in all cases.  The statement oversimplifies the complex nature of their authority. Statement 4 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple and Vithala Temple Complex at Hampi are renowned examples of Vijayanagara architecture.  Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 4) are entirely accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. His address was widely acclaimed and significantly impacted the perception of Hinduism in the West. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ramakrishna Mission, established in 1897, actively engages in diverse social service initiatives, including education and healthcare, in addition to its religious objectives. Statement 4 is correct. His meeting with Jamsetji Tata in 1893 influenced Tata's decision to establish the IISC.  Only statement 4 is fully accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN declared June 21st as International Yoga Day in 2014. Statement 2 is correct. Yoga is indeed recognized as one of the six schools of Indian philosophy. Statement 3 is correct. The Sanskrit root "yuj" meaning "to join" or "to unite" is the etymological basis of the word "Yoga." Statement 4 is incorrect. Evidence of yoga practices and related concepts is found in earlier sources, including the Vedas and Indus Valley Civilization artifacts, in addition to Patanjali's Yogasutra.

2.  Ashoka Chakra
3.  Mahavir Chakra
4.  Kirti Chakra
5.  Vir Chakra
6.  Shaurya Chakra

Which of the above awards are specifically designated as wartime gallantry awards?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 5
(c) 2, 4, and 6
(d) 1, 3, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra were instituted in 1950 as wartime gallantry awards.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include awards not specifically mentioned as wartime awards. Option (b) correctly identifies the three wartime gallantry awards listed.  Understanding the historical context and the specific designations of these awards is crucial for answering this question correctly. The other options include awards that, while prestigious gallantry awards, are not explicitly categorized as *wartime* gallantry awards in the provided text.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Established in 1897
2.  Engages in social service
3.  Runs hospitals and schools
4.  Promotes scientific temperament
5.  Founded by Swami Vivekananda

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Ramakrishna Mission?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the Ramakrishna Mission was established in 1897, engages in various forms of social service (including running hospitals and schools), and that Swami Vivekananda's actions indirectly promoted a scientific temperament.  However, while the Mission's activities contribute to a scientific temperament, it's not its primary stated goal. Therefore, four out of the five statements accurately reflect the Ramakrishna Mission's attributes. Option (c) reflects this accurately. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the factual information provided about the Ramakrishna Mission.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It was a non-violent protest.
2.  It primarily focused on temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.
3.  It led to the immediate and complete opening of all access routes to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.
4.  Mahatma Gandhi played a significant role in supporting the movement.
5.  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was a key figure.

How many of these statements are accurate depictions of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage confirms that the Vaikom Satyagraha was a non-violent protest (1), primarily focused on temple entry for lower-caste Hindus (2), and that Mahatma Gandhi and E.V. Ramasamy Naicker played significant roles (4, 5). However, it is crucial to note that the Satyagraha did *not* lead to the immediate and complete opening of all access routes to the temple; only some were opened after a lengthy period (3).  Therefore, four of the statements are accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the number of accurate statements.  This question tests the ability to accurately analyze and discern factual details from a descriptive passage.


**4. Consider the following awards:**

1.  Padma Vibhushan
2.  Padma Bhushan
3.  Padma Shri
4.  Bharat Ratna
5.  Nobel Prize

How many of the above are civilian awards conferred by the Indian government?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage details the Padma Awards (Vibhushan, Bhushan, and Shri) as high civilian honours of India.  It also mentions the Bharat Ratna as India's highest civilian award. The Nobel Prize, while a prestigious international award, is not conferred by the Indian government. Therefore, only three of the listed awards are conferred by the Indian government. Option (b) is the correct answer. The other options either overestimate or underestimate the number of Indian civilian awards listed.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Anubhav Awards:**

1.  Conferred by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Anubhav Awards?

(a) Only one

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare (1), are based on write-ups from retiring central government employees (2), and aim to foster good governance (3).  However, they are not awarded annually on Republic Day (4), and are not open to private sector employees (5). Thus, only three statements accurately describe the Anubhav Awards. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the features of the Anubhav Awards.  The question tests the ability to identify accurate details from a description while filtering out misleading statements.


**6. Consider the following about the Cultural Property Agreement (CPA) signed between India and the USA:**

How many of the above statements correctly describe the CPA?

(a) Only two

(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage indicates that the CPA aims to prevent illicit trafficking of antiquities (1), was signed on the sidelines of the 46th World Heritage Committee meeting (2), and facilitates repatriation (4).  It also restricts the importation of certain materials (5).  However, it does *not* replace the 1970 UNESCO Convention; rather, it complements existing efforts (3). Therefore, four of the statements accurately describe the CPA.  The other options misrepresent aspects of the agreement, highlighting the need for precise understanding of its provisions.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum:**

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage confirms that the museum commemorates the 2001 Gujarat earthquake victims (1), is situated on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, which also houses Bhujio Fort (5), and features a large Miyawaki forest (3).  However, it was inaugurated in 2022, not 2023 (4), and while in Bhuj, it's specifically on Bhujiyo Dungar hill (2).  Therefore, three statements are accurate.  The other options either overstate or understate the accuracy of the provided descriptions. The question emphasizes the importance of precise factual recall.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of Nelson Mandela's life and legacy?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage confirms that Mandela was South Africa's first democratically elected president (1), received the Nobel Peace Prize (although in 1993, not 1994) (2), was awarded the Bharat Ratna by India (3), and was a follower of Gandhi's teachings (4).  However, the passage clarifies that he initially led non-violent protests (5).  Therefore, four out of the five statements are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) inaccurately reflect the details of Mandela's life and legacy.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of biographical details and the ability to distinguish between accurate and slightly inaccurate information.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of megalithic structure characterized by being semi-subterranean chamber tombs.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While many megaliths were used as burial sites, their functions were not limited to this. Some served as ceremonial or ritual spaces, or even had multiple uses. Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions three basic types of megaliths, encompassing those used for burial and those with other purposes. Statement 4 is incorrect. Megalithic cultures often practiced semi-nomadic lifestyles, moving between different areas depending on seasonal resources and conditions, and weren't always confined to single, pre-defined settlements within forest reserves.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the text states Phanigiri is approximately 110 kilometers from Hyderabad, not 220.

Statement 3 is incorrect; Phanigiri shows evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects coexisting. Statement 4 is correct;  life-size stucco sculptures of Bodhisattvas have been unearthed there. Thus, three of the four statements are accurate.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect:  While Rajendra I's campaigns resulted in Sri Lanka becoming a Chola province, Rajaraja I's conquest was not a complete annexation of the entire island. Statement 2 is correct: Rajendra I's expeditions reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Statement 3 is incorrect: Nagapattinam served as a key trading center for the Cholas, not Thanjavur. Statement 4 is incorrect: The Chera navy was defeated at Kandalursalai, not Mamallapuram.  Therefore, only two statements correctly describe the extent of Chola naval power.

Rajendra I's expeditions to the Sailendra Empire represent a remarkable feat of naval logistics and military power, extending Chola influence far beyond the Indian subcontinent.  The annexation of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I solidified Chola control over a strategically important island. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Chola navy's reach and ambition far surpassed merely controlling internal waterways. Their naval power was a critical element of their expansionist policy.


**2. Consider the following: **

1.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland
2.  Transhumance in 10 European States
3.  The Gujjar, Bakarwal, and Gaddis nomadic pastoralist traditions of the Himalayas
4.  The traditional seasonal livestock movement practices of the Rajasthan plains.

Which of the above have been declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland and Transhumance in 10 European States were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023. While the Himalayan and Rajasthan transhumance practices are mentioned as examples of the broader tradition, the text does not indicate they have received this specific UNESCO designation. Therefore, only options 1 and 2 are correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect assertions about the UNESCO recognition.


**3. Consider the following pairs relating to Indian literary works and their inclusion in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  Ramcharitmanas: A 16th-century epic poem in Awadhi, a poetic retelling of the Ramayana.
2.  Panchatantra: An ancient Sanskrit collection of fables, known for its "story within a story" structure.
3.  Sahṛdayāloka-Locana: A Sanskrit text on Indian poetics, with a commentary by Abhinava Gupta.
4.  Arthashastra: A treatise on statecraft and political economy by Kautilya.

How many of the above pairs correctly identify works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions the inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  Arthashastra, while a significant work of Indian literature, is not mentioned in the context of this specific register. Therefore, only three of the listed works are correctly paired with their inclusion in the register.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Abhaya Mudra:**

1.  It is a symbol of fearlessness.
2.  It is primarily associated with the Buddha's taming of a mad elephant.
3.  It is displayed by all five Dhyani Buddhas.
4.  It is a mudra that signifies the preaching of Dharma.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Abhaya Mudra?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage correctly identifies Abhaya Mudra as a symbol of fearlessness and its association with the Buddha taming a mad elephant. However, it specifies that it is displayed by the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi, not all five.  The Dharmachakrapravartana mudra is the one associated with preaching Dharma, not Abhaya Mudra. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Abhaya Mudra.


**5. Consider the following regarding the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA):**

1.  It aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA.
2.  It restricts the importation of all Indian artifacts into the United States.
3.  It facilitates the quick seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities.
4.  It was signed during the 45th World Heritage Committee meeting.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features and context of the India-US CPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage accurately states that the CPA aims to curb illicit trafficking, facilitates repatriation, and was signed on the sidelines of the 46th (not 45th) World Heritage Committee meeting. However, it does not state that *all* Indian artifacts are restricted but rather *certain* archaeological and ethnological material of Indian origin. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties ruled successively.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab and military victories against Orissa and Bijapur.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors with no military responsibilities.
4.  The Virupaksha and Vithala Temples are notable architectural achievements of the empire.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe the Vijayanagara Empire. The empire's succession of dynasties, Krishnadevaraya's military successes, and the architectural marvels of the temples are well-established facts. However, statement 3 is incorrect;  Amara-Nayakas were *military* commanders who also collected taxes.  Their military role was crucial to the empire's functioning.


**7. Consider the following  regarding the Nalanda University:**

1.  It was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE.
2.  It was a monastic university encompassing residential and educational buildings, stupas, and shrines.
3.  It offered instruction in Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, but not Vajrayana Buddhism.
4.  The new campus inaugurated recently is a "Net Zero Green Campus."


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Nalanda University?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  The founding by Kumargupta I, the nature of the university as a monastic center, and the "Net Zero Green Campus" designation for the new campus are all supported by the provided text. Statement 3 is incorrect; the text explicitly lists Vajrayana Buddhism among the disciplines taught at the ancient Nalanda University.


**8. Consider the following about Eri Silk:**

1. It is produced by the Philosamia ricini silkworm.
2. It is known as the world's only vegan silk.
3.  It is a type of silk produced only in India.
4. The Oeko-Tex certification guarantees its production is always entirely organic.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding Eri Silk?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Eri silk is indeed produced by *Philosamia ricini* and is considered vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge from the cocoon.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while India is a significant producer, it's not the *only* country producing Eri silk.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Oeko-Tex certification ensures the absence of harmful substances and environmentally friendly practices, but doesn't guarantee *entirely* organic production in all cases.


**9. Consider the following regarding the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake:**

1.  It had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale.
2.  Its epicenter was Bhuj.
3.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum commemorates its victims.
4.  The museum features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.


How many of the statements above correctly describe the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake and its memorial?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate.  The earthquake's magnitude, epicenter, the museum's purpose, and the inclusion of a large Miyawaki forest are all correctly described in the provided text.


**10. Consider the following regarding megalithic sites in Telangana:**

1. Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site.
2. Dolmenoid cists, a type of semi-subterranean chamber tomb, are found in the region.
3.  Devarlabanda Mula features depictions of both animals and humans.
4.  The rock art sites at Damaratogu depict only animals.


How many of the above statements accurately describe recently discovered archaeological sites in Telangana?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate according to the provided text.  Ooragutta's designation, the presence of dolmenoid cists, and the animal-only depictions at Damaratogu are all supported by the information given. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Devarlabanda Mula is specifically described as having *only* animal depictions, and no humans or weapons.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Kalinga War (261 BCE)
2.  The establishment of the Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646)
3.  The reign of Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE)
4.  The Swadeshi Movement (launched on 7th August 1905)

Which of the above are associated with significant historical events in India that impacted its cultural or political landscape?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kalinga War, under Ashoka the Great, significantly impacted the Mauryan Empire and led to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism. This event had lasting consequences for the spread of Buddhism and the empire's governance. The establishment of the Vijayanagara Empire marked a pivotal moment in South Indian history, shaping its political and architectural landscape for centuries. The reign of Kharavela, known for his patronage of Jainism and the Hathigumpha inscription, is a crucial period in Odisha's history. The Swadeshi Movement, while significant for Indian nationalism, is not directly linked to the other events in terms of direct impact on the political or cultural landscape in the same way as the other three.  Option (a) accurately reflects the historical significance of the first three events in shaping India's political and cultural landscape.  Option (b) incorrectly includes the Swadeshi Movement, which, while important, is not directly comparable in scale or long-term impact on the political and cultural landscape like the other three. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect because they exclude or include the Swadeshi Movement inappropriately.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Virupaksha Temple
2.  The Vithala Temple Complex
3.  The Hazara Ram Temple
4.  The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya

How many of the above are associated with significant architectural marvels of historical periods in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Virupaksha Temple, Vithala Temple Complex, and Hazara Ram Temple are all renowned architectural marvels associated with the Vijayanagara Empire and its unique style of temple construction. These structures showcase sophisticated techniques and designs representative of a rich artistic and cultural heritage. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya, while historically significant, is not primarily an architectural marvel in the same vein as the other three.  It's a pillar with historical and religious importance, not a complex architectural structure like the temples. Therefore, only three of the listed items (the three temples) represent significant architectural marvels from different historical periods in India. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either underestimate or overestimate the number of architectural marvels listed.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Transhumance in 10 European States
2.  Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland
3.  The transhumance practice in the Himalayas (Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas)
4.  The transhumance practice in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh

How many of the above are examples of transhumance traditions recognized for their cultural significance or prevalence in different regions?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Transhumance, the seasonal movement of livestock, is a practice with cultural significance across various regions.  The statement correctly identifies that Transhumance in 10 European States and the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland are both recognized intangible cultural heritages. The statement also accurately notes that the practice is widespread in the Himalayan region with nomadic tribes like the Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, and in the plains of several Indian states. All four options represent examples of transhumance traditions, highlighting the geographical spread and cultural significance of this practice.  Therefore, all four options are correct.  There are no incorrect options in this case.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Ramcharitmanas
2.  Panchatantra
3.  Sahṛdayāloka-Locana
4.  Amuktamalyada

Which of the above are Indian literary works included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register or are otherwise notable works of Indian literature?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  Amuktamalyada, while a significant work of Telugu literature by Krishnadevaraya, is not mentioned in the text as part of the UNESCO register. Therefore, only the first three options are correctly identified as being part of the UNESCO register. Option (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include Amuktamalyada incorrectly or exclude one of the correctly identified works.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Abhaya Mudra
2.  The Bhumisparsha Mudra
3.  The Dhyana Mudra
4.  The Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra

How many of the above are mudras (hand gestures) associated with Buddhism and with specific symbolic meanings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text describes the Abhaya Mudra (symbol of fearlessness), the Bhumisparsha Mudra (calling the earth to witness), the Dhyana Mudra (meditation), and the Dharmachakrapravartana Mudra (preaching of the dhamma) as mudras with specific symbolic meanings within Buddhism.  All four are correctly identified as Buddhist mudras with distinct symbolic significance. Therefore, all four options are correctly associated with Buddhism and its symbolic hand gestures. No options are incorrect.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The Indian Olympic Association (IOA)
2.  The Khelo India program
3.  The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)
4.  The RESET Programme

How many of the above are initiatives related to the promotion of sports in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) coordinates India's participation in international sporting events. The Khelo India program aims to develop athletes at various levels. The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provides support to elite athletes. The RESET Programme empowers retired sportspersons.  All four are directly related to promoting sports in India, either at the organizational, developmental, or support level.  Therefore, all four options are correctly associated with sports promotion in India. No options are incorrect.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  Nagapattinam
2.  Kandalursalai
3.  Sri Lanka
4.  Maldives

How many of the above are places associated with the significant naval expeditions of the Chola Empire?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions Nagapattinam as a key trading center, Kandalursalai as the site of a Chola naval victory, Sri Lanka as a target of Chola conquests, and the Maldives as another area of Chola influence.  All four locations are directly associated with the significant naval expansion of the Chola Empire.  Therefore, all four locations are correctly associated with the Chola Empire's naval expeditions. No options are incorrect.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Oeko-Tex certification
2.  Mulberry silk
3.  Eri silk
4.  Muga silk

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text mentions Oeko-Tex certification as a standard for environmentally friendly textiles, specifically referencing Eri silk's achievement of this certification.  It also mentions that India produces all five types of silk, including Mulberry, Eri, and Muga silk. Therefore, all four elements are correctly associated with the Indian silk industry or its certification standards. All options are correct.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum
2.  The Miyawaki Forest at the Smritivan Museum
3.  The Bhujio Fort
4.  The 2001 Gujarat Earthquake

How many of the above are related to the 2001 Gujarat earthquake or its aftermath?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was built in memory of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake victims.  The museum features a large Miyawaki forest. The museum is situated on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, which also houses the Bhujio Fort. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake is the central event around which all other elements revolve.  Therefore, all four are directly related to the earthquake or its consequences.  All options are correct.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty
2.  The Saluva Dynasty
3.  The Tuluva Dynasty
4.  The Aravidu Dynasty

How many of the above are dynasties associated with the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

The text specifically lists the Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu dynasties as successive ruling dynasties of the Vijayanagara Empire.  All four are correctly identified as dynasties associated with the empire.  Therefore, all four options are correct. No options are incorrect.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the questions below are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors to test in-depth knowledge.


**1. Consider the following features related to ancient Indian economic activities:**

1.  Seasonal livestock movement practiced by communities like Gujars and Bakarwals.
2.  Trade in spices like black pepper and cardamom with diverse international partners.
3.  The "calico" cloth trade, originating from Calicut's hand-woven cotton industry.
4.  The flourishing of Buddhist universities like Nalanda and Vikramshila, attracting scholars and generating intellectual capital.

How many of the above features reflect significant economic aspects of ancient India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements highlight crucial economic aspects of ancient India.  Statement 1 describes transhumance, a vital economic practice for pastoral communities, ensuring sustainable livestock rearing and resource management. Statement 2 illustrates the significant role of spice trade in generating wealth and fostering international connections, influencing the early global economy. Statement 3 focuses on the textile industry, a major source of employment and export revenue for Calicut, demonstrating the region's economic prowess. Statement 4 highlights the importance of education as an economic driver, attracting students and scholars from across the globe to the renowned universities, which in turn stimulated knowledge creation and economic activity through the flow of intellectual capital and associated services.  Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect significant economic facets of ancient India.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the economic impact of historical events in India:**

1.  The Mauryan conquest of Kalinga led to significant economic disruption due to warfare and subsequent policy changes.
2.  The Chola dynasty's naval expeditions stimulated trade and economic expansion across Southeast Asia.
3.  The Ahom dynasty's administrative structure, despite being a monarchy, fostered a degree of economic stability through its council of ministers.
4.  The establishment of UNESCO’s ‘City of Literature’ status for Kozhikode primarily boosted the city’s tourism sector, not its traditional industries.

Which of the above statements correctly identify economic implications of historical events?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly illustrate the economic consequences of historical events. The Mauryan conquest of Kalinga (Statement 1) undoubtedly caused significant economic disruption due to the war itself, followed by the integration of Kalinga into the Mauryan economy, which may have led to both challenges and opportunities for the region's economic structure. The Chola dynasty's naval expeditions (Statement 2) had a profound economic impact by expanding trade networks and access to resources in Southeast Asia, resulting in increased wealth and influence. The Ahom dynasty’s administrative system (Statement 3), despite its monarchical nature, provided a degree of economic stability through its council of ministers, suggesting a balance of power that may have contributed to a more stable economic environment.  Statement 4 is incorrect because while tourism is a significant benefit, the “City of Literature” status also boosts the cultural industries (publishing, writing, etc.) directly linked to Kozhikode's literary heritage.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is (a).



**3. Consider the following regarding the economic aspects of ancient Indian archaeological sites:**

1.  The discovery of a coin hoard at Phanigiri in Telangana provides insights into the Ikshvaku period's monetary system and trade.
2.  The Bavikonda Monastery's suboptimal maintenance reflects the challenges in preserving historical sites and their potential economic value as tourist attractions.
3.  Megalithic sites like Ooragutta in Telangana, with their associated artifacts, offer potential for economic development through tourism and cultural preservation.
4.  The collapse of the Virupaksha Temple's pavilion highlights the vulnerability of historical structures and the economic cost of their restoration.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the economic dimensions of ancient Indian archaeological sites?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately address the economic dimensions of ancient Indian archaeological sites. Statement 1 correctly points out that the discovery of coins sheds light on the economic systems and trade practices of the Ikshvaku period. Statement 2 highlights the economic aspect of preservation, emphasizing the lost potential of tourist revenue due to neglect. Statement 3 correctly acknowledges the potential of megalithic sites to drive economic growth through tourism and heritage preservation initiatives. Statement 4 accurately notes the economic costs associated with maintaining and restoring invaluable historical sites, emphasizing the financial implications of preserving cultural heritage.  Thus, all four statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following aspects of India's cultural heritage and their potential economic implications:**

1.  The inclusion of Indian literary works in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register enhances their cultural value and potential for related industries like publishing and tourism.
2.  The Oeko-Tex certification for Eri silk in Northeast India signifies the potential for economic growth through sustainable and ethically produced textiles.
3.  The celebration of National Handloom Day promotes the handloom industry, a significant source of rural employment and income generation for women.
4.  The discovery of Denisovan remains in Tibet primarily holds scientific, not economic significance for India.

Which of the above statements correctly assess the economic potential linked to India's cultural heritage?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly highlight the economic potential connected to India's cultural heritage.  Statement 1 points out that inclusion in the UNESCO register increases the market value of the literary works, boosting related industries. Statement 2 emphasizes the economic benefits of sustainable practices in the silk industry, leading to potential market expansion. Statement 3 rightly identifies the significant economic contribution of the handloom sector, especially for women in rural areas. Statement 4 is incorrect; while primarily scientific, the discovery could have indirect economic benefits through tourism and research funding.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is (a).


These questions aim to test detailed knowledge and analytical skills, reflecting the demanding nature of UPSC examinations.  Remember that accurate recall of facts and their nuanced application are crucial for success.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Prix Versailles Award:**

1. It is an annual award granted by UNESCO since 2015.
2.  It exclusively recognizes architectural achievements in hotels and restaurants.
3. The award includes a significant monetary grant for the winning projects.
4. Projects must demonstrate innovation, reflect local heritage, and promote social interaction.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the UNESCO's Prix Versailles Award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Prix Versailles Award is indeed an annual award presented by UNESCO, commencing in 2015.  It celebrates excellence in contemporary architecture worldwide.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While hotels and restaurants are included in the award categories, the Prix Versailles encompasses a broader range of architectural projects, including airports, campuses, passenger stations, sports facilities, museums, emporiums, and more.  The award's scope is not limited to the hospitality sector.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  A crucial aspect of the Prix Versailles Award is that it does *not* include a monetary grant.  The recognition itself serves as the primary reward, highlighting the prestige associated with the accolade.

Statement 4 is correct.  The award criteria explicitly emphasize innovation, the incorporation of local heritage elements, and the promotion of social interaction and participation within the designed spaces.  These elements are considered vital to the award's assessment process.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. It is India's highest award in the field of cinema.
2.  It is presented biennially by the Ministry of Culture.
3. The award includes a cash prize and a golden lotus medallion.
4. Satyajit Ray was awarded this honor in 1995.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Dadasaheb Phalke Award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed the highest cinematic honor bestowed in India. It represents a lifetime achievement recognition in the Indian film industry.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The award is presented *annually*, not biennially, by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Culture.  The frequency and presenting body are crucial details to note.

Statement 3 is correct.  The award includes a cash prize (the amount may vary over time) and the prestigious Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion.  These components represent the tangible aspects of the recognition.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Satyajit Ray received the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1985, not 1995.  The specific year is a key piece of information demonstrating the awardee's place in cinematic history.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following concerning the Nalanda University:**

1. It was founded in the 6th century CE by Chandragupta Maurya.
2.  The university's curriculum included subjects like medicine, astronomy, and war strategy.
3.  It was primarily a secular institution, open to all faiths.
4.  The modern Nalanda University campus is a "Net Zero Green Campus."

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Nalanda University (ancient and modern)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nalanda University was founded in the 5th century CE by Kumargupta I, not in the 6th century by Chandragupta Maurya. The founder and the century are distinct historical details.

Statement 2 is correct. The ancient Nalanda University's curriculum was remarkably comprehensive, encompassing a wide range of subjects, including medicine, astronomy, and even war strategy, reflecting the advanced nature of its educational program.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While Nalanda was known for its inclusivity, it had strong Buddhist connections, and it was a monastic university in its structure.  Therefore, it wasn't entirely secular in the modern understanding of the term.

Statement 4 is correct. The new Nalanda University campus is designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus," showcasing a commitment to environmental sustainability in its design and operation.  This aligns with modern educational priorities.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**4. Consider the following facts about the Bharat Ratna:**

1. It is awarded posthumously only in exceptional circumstances.
2.  The award includes a substantial monetary prize.
3. Sachin Tendulkar was the youngest recipient of the award.
4.  A maximum of three awards can be conferred annually.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the Bharat Ratna?


(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While initially not awarded posthumously, the rules changed in 1966.  It is now awarded posthumously, but not routinely.  The “exceptional circumstances” qualifier is important.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharat Ratna does *not* include a monetary component.  The honor itself is the primary reward.

Statement 3 is correct. Sachin Tendulkar was indeed the youngest recipient of the Bharat Ratna.  His age at the time of receiving the award is a notable fact.

Statement 4 is largely correct. The standard is a maximum of three awards per year, though exceptions have been made (like in 1999 and 2024). The wording "can be given" allows for these exceptions.


Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are largely correct.


**5. Consider the following about the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD):**

2.  It is observed in conjunction with the Pavāraṇā festival.
3.  The event is solely observed in India.
4.  It marks the end of the first Rainy Retreat (Vassa).

How many of the above statements accurately describe the IAD?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates the day Lord Buddha descended from the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Sankassiya, not his enlightenment.  The specific event being commemorated is critical.

Statement 2 is correct. IAD coincides with the Pavāraṇā festival, which marks the conclusion of the Rainy Retreat.  This temporal connection is significant.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While observed in India, the significance of IAD extends beyond national boundaries due to the global reach of Buddhism.  The scope of the observance is an important aspect.

Statement 4 is correct. IAD marks the end of the first Rainy Retreat (Vassa), a period of three months when Buddhist monks must reside in one place.  This is a central element of the observance.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoW program was launched in 1992, not 1997. The launch year is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas is among the Indian literary works included in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  This highlights the specific inclusion of Indian works.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While it focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, the MoW program as a whole aims to preserve and promote global documentary heritage.  The larger context is important.

Statement 4 is correct. The MoW program's overall goal is to preserve and promote global documentary heritage, ensuring universal access and raising public awareness.  This is the program's central objective.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AMASR Act does not *mandate* delisting; it empowers the government to delist, based on assessments of national importance.  The distinction between empowerment and mandate is crucial.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act explicitly grants the Central Government the authority to declare monuments of national importance, reflecting its role in heritage preservation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established by an *amendment* to the AMASR Act in 2010, not by the original 1958 Act.  The timing of the establishment is a key element.

Statement 4 is correct. The Act includes provisions for the regulation of archaeological excavations, a crucial aspect of protecting archaeological sites.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is led by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), not the World Bank. The leading organization is a critical piece of information.

Statement 2 is correct. Transhumance is accurately defined as the seasonal movement of livestock and associated human communities, a core element of the initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Himalayan transhumance is included, the initiative's scope extends beyond the Himalayas, recognizing transhumance practices in various regions globally.  The geographic scope is a key element.

Statement 4 is correct. Two transhumance traditions were indeed declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO in 2023, reflecting the initiative's success.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the India-US CPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Statement 2 is correct. The agreement specifically restricts the importation of certain archaeological and ethnological materials of Indian origin into the United States.  This is a key provision.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CPA was signed during the 46th, not 45th, World Heritage Committee meeting.  The meeting number is a specific fact.

Statement 4 is correct. A key goal of the CPA is to facilitate the quicker seizure and repatriation of Indian antiquities illegally brought to the US.  This is a central aim.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Global Gender Gap Report (2024)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report is published *annually*, not biennially, by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the United Nations.  Both the frequency and the publishing body are important distinctions.

Statement 2 is correct. The report assesses gender parity across four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.  The dimensions are crucial to understanding the report's scope.

Statement 3 is correct. Iceland has consistently ranked highly in the Global Gender Gap Index for many years, reflecting its progress in gender equality.  The consistent ranking is a notable aspect.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Kasturi Cotton Bharat leverages blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of Indian cotton, enhancing its quality and global competitiveness. Statement 4 is also correct. TEXPROCIL serves as the implementing agency for the initiative, highlighting its importance in the initiative's execution.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Textiles is a key player, it is a joint initiative involving multiple stakeholders including the Cotton Corporation of India and various trade bodies. Statement 3 is incorrect. The initiative's primary aim is not cost reduction but to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through branding, traceability, and certification, creating a sustainable ecosystem. Thus, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

While the museum does commemorate the 2001 Gujarat earthquake victims, the earthquake's magnitude was 7.9, not 8.7, on the Richter scale.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Project PARI's core aim is to make art more accessible to the public through urban installations. The Lalit Kala Akademi, an autonomous institution under the Ministry of Culture, is indeed involved in its execution. The project includes various traditional art forms such as Thangka, Cheriyal painting, etc. However, statement 1 is incorrect. Project PARI is an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, not a joint venture with the Ministry of Textiles.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements concerning the Bharat Ratna are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The award's reverse side does feature the inscription 'Satyameva Jayate'. Sachin Tendulkar was indeed the youngest recipient.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While posthumous conferment is possible, it is not automatic for all deserving cases. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution prohibits the use of 'Bharat Ratna' as a title. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


6. Consider the following statements about Transhumance:

(d) 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Transhumance is accurately defined as the seasonal movement of livestock accompanied by human communities. Statement 4 is also correct. The mentioned tribes are known for their participation in transhumance practices. However, statement 2 is incorrect. In 2023, *two* transhumance traditions received recognition as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity. Statement 3 is also incorrect. While prevalent in the Himalayas, transhumance is also practiced in other regions of India. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.

How many of the above statements regarding the Ancient Nalanda University are correct?

(a) Only one

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. Admissions were indeed strictly merit-based, with rigorous examinations conducted.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it was founded by Kumargupta I, not Chandragupta Maurya. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while Vedic studies were part of the curriculum, the university encompassed a wider range of subjects, including various Buddhist philosophies. Statement 3 is partially correct in its description of the library's immense size, but the exact number of books is debated by historians and is not definitively nine million. Therefore, only one statement is entirely accurate.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the tournament was held in Toronto, Canada, not Budapest, Hungary. Statement 4 is incorrect; the tournament was introduced in 1950, not 1975. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


9. Consider the following statements about the Olympic Order Award:

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Padma Awards are indeed among India's highest civilian honors, and they are normally not given posthumously, although exceptions are made.

Therefore, only three statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics and related aspects.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions. He was a significant philanthropist who supported education, particularly for girls, and played a role in the early development of the Indian railway system. His contributions to urban planning in Bombay are also well-documented. However, there's no evidence suggesting he authored economic treatises.  Option (d) is incorrect because statement 4 is factually inaccurate. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect as they underestimate his documented contributions.


**2. Consider the following regarding Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy and work:**

1.  He advocated for a return to Vedic principles, rejecting idolatry and ritualistic worship.
2.  His book, *Satyartha Prakash*, emphasized the importance of caste-based social hierarchy.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. Dayanand Saraswati championed a return to Vedic principles, rejecting what he saw as later accretions to Hinduism. He established the Arya Samaj, a reformist movement.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Dayanand Saraswati addressed the caste system, he advocated for reform and opposed untouchability, not a rigid adherence to the existing hierarchy.  He did not support the British Raj. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is false. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete.


**3. Consider the following about the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  They were a part of the Maratha Confederacy.
2.  Malhar Rao II played a crucial role in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Holkars were a prominent Maratha dynasty, and they played a role in the economic development of Maheshwar, notably promoting the Maheswari weaving industry. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Malhar Rao II was involved in the *Third* Anglo-Maratha War, not the second.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; their relationship with the British was complex and not one of consistent support. Option (a) accurately identifies the correct statements, while other options include inaccuracies.

1.  He oversaw a dramatic increase in the Tata Group's revenue.
2.  He launched the Tata Nano, a revolutionary low-cost car.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  Ratan Tata's leadership saw a massive expansion of the Tata Group, and the launch of the Tata Nano was a significant event. However, statement 3 is incorrect; he received the Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan, but not the Bharat Ratna.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; his views on globalization were not openly critical.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Memory of the World (MOW) Programme:**

1.  It aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage.
2.  The programme is solely focused on preserving ancient Sanskrit texts.
3.  It includes a three-tiered register system: International, Regional, and National.

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 3, and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The MOW Programme aims to preserve global documentary heritage, uses a three-tiered register system, and recently included the mentioned Indian manuscripts in its Asia-Pacific register.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the programme's scope is much broader than just Sanskrit texts.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct statements.


**6. Consider the following regarding the promotion of classical languages in India:**

1.  Institutions like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan are dedicated to the study and promotion of Sanskrit.
2.  The government has implemented a uniform policy for promoting all classical languages equally across India.
3.  The Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) plays a role in promoting certain classical languages.

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate.  Dedicated institutions support Sanskrit, and the CIIL contributes to the promotion of some classical languages.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while there are efforts to promote classical languages, there isn't a perfectly uniform policy across all languages.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the promotion encompasses literary, cultural, and historical aspects beyond religious texts.  Only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe the situation.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics-related aspects and adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following contributions of Nana Jagannath Shankarseth:**

1.  Donated family land for establishing schools, prioritizing girls' education.
2.  Played a crucial role in planning the layout of Bombay's buildings, streets, and avenues.
3.  Served as a key figure in the establishment of the Bombay Stock Exchange.
4.  Authored several influential economic treatises advocating for free-market principles.

How many of the above contributions directly relate to his impact on the economic development of Bombay?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's primary economic contribution was his role in shaping the urban landscape of Bombay.  His contribution to the city's infrastructure, through the planning of buildings, streets, and avenues, laid the foundation for its future economic growth.  While his patronage of education (particularly girls' education) indirectly contributed to human capital development, and thus economic progress, it's not a direct economic contribution in the same way as urban planning.  The other options are incorrect. The Bombay Stock Exchange's establishment predates Shankarseth's major influence, and there is no evidence suggesting he authored economic treatises.  Therefore, only option 2 represents a direct economic impact.


**2. Consider the following regarding Swami Dayanand Saraswati's philosophy:**

1.  Advocated for a return to Vedic principles, rejecting idolatry and ritualistic worship.
2.  Authored "Satyartha Prakash," a key text emphasizing social reform through Vedic principles.
3.  Established numerous agricultural cooperatives to improve rural economic conditions in India.
4.  Championed the adoption of modern industrial technologies for economic advancement.

How many of the above accurately reflect Swami Dayanand Saraswati's direct contributions to economic thought or policy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Swami Dayanand Saraswati's primary economic influence was indirect, stemming from his social and religious reforms.  His emphasis on a return to Vedic principles and his writings, like "Satyartha Prakash," indirectly impacted economic thought by promoting social reform that potentially could have improved economic productivity and social justice.  However, he did not directly establish agricultural cooperatives or champion modern industrial technologies.  These activities are associated with later reformers and policymakers. Therefore, only the emphasis on Vedic principles that indirectly affected economic thought is accurate.


**3. Consider the following aspects of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's rule:**

1.  Extensive temple reconstruction projects across various regions of India.
2.  Patronage of renowned Sanskrit scholars and Marathi poets.
3.  Implementation of significant economic reforms, such as land redistribution and tax reductions.
4.  Development of a robust infrastructure network, including roads, canals, and bridges.

How many of the above directly contributed to the economic prosperity of the Malwa region under her reign?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While Ahilyabai Holkar's patronage of arts and culture (options 1 and 2) enhanced the region's prestige, her direct economic impact came from infrastructure development (roads, canals, bridges) and potential economic reforms (though specifics on land redistribution or tax reductions are limited in readily available historical accounts). Infrastructure improvements directly facilitated trade and commerce, while economic reforms could have stimulated productivity.  Temple reconstruction, while important, was primarily a religious undertaking, not a direct economic driver. Hence, options 3 and 4 are the most directly linked to economic prosperity.


**4. Consider the following achievements associated with Ratan Tata's leadership of the Tata Group:**

1.  Significant expansion of the Tata Group's revenue, making it one of India's largest employers.
2.  Launch of the Tata Nano, a revolutionary low-cost car aimed at the Indian mass market.
3.  Substantial investment in renewable energy sources, positioning the Tata Group as a leader in sustainable development.
4.  Establishment of a new state-of-the-art textile mill in Mumbai to revitalize the city's textile industry.

How many of the above directly contributed to the economic growth and development of India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ratan Tata's leadership of the Tata Group significantly impacted India's economy through various initiatives.  The expansion of the Tata Group's revenue and employment (option 1) directly contributed to economic growth. The launch of the Tata Nano (option 2) stimulated the automobile sector and impacted transportation.  Investments in renewable energy (option 3) promoted sustainable development, impacting the energy sector and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Option 4 is incorrect; there is no evidence of a new state-of-the-art textile mill being established during his tenure. Therefore, three of the listed achievements directly contributed to India's economic growth.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Bharat Ratna award:**

1.  It is India's highest civilian award, conferred for outstanding service in any field.
2.  Recommendations for the award are formally submitted by a dedicated committee of experts.
3.  Recipients receive a monetary grant along with the medal and certificate.
4.  The award can be conferred posthumously, a practice established in recent years.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Bharat Ratna award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The Bharat Ratna is indeed India's highest civilian honor, and posthumous awards are permitted.  However, statements 2 and 3 are incorrect.  Recommendations are made by the Prime Minister, not a formal expert committee, and no monetary grant accompanies the award. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the Bharat Ratna.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics-related aspects where applicable, and adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that some sections of the target content did not lend themselves to economic MCQ's, so the focus is primarily on awards and their implications.

1.  They are awarded posthumously in exceptional cases.
2.  They are conferred in only two categories: Padma Vibhushan and Padma Shri.
3.  The awards are announced annually on Independence Day.
4.  Recipients can use the award as a prefix or suffix to their name.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the awards are not typically posthumous but can be in exceptional circumstances. Statement 2 is incorrect; there are three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri. Statement 3 is incorrect; the awards are announced annually on Republic Day.

**1. Consider the following aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The discovery of a standardized system of weights and measures.
2.  Evidence of extensive internal trade networks.
3.  The existence of trading posts like Dilmun and Makan, indicating foreign trade connections.
4.  Exports primarily consisting of agricultural produce and handcrafted goods.
5.  Imports including valuable metals and precious stones.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the economic activities of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Indus Valley Civilization possessed a sophisticated economic system.  A standardized system of weights and measures facilitated trade and commerce within the civilization, suggesting a well-organized and centralized administrative structure. The discovery of artifacts from distant regions within the Indus Valley and beyond points to a vast internal trade network.  The presence of trading posts like Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) in Mesopotamian records confirms the existence of extensive foreign trade connections.  Exports consisted of agricultural products (grains) and handcrafted goods (jewelry and pottery), indicating a diverse and productive economy.  Imports of materials like copper and precious stones suggest that the Indus Valley Civilization had access to valuable resources beyond its geographical boundaries, further supporting its participation in extensive trading networks.  Therefore, all five statements accurately describe the economic activities of the Indus Valley Civilization.  The options designed as distractors play on the possibility of candidates misremembering specific details of the trade.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the religious and cultural practices of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The presence of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), depicted in a yogic posture on seals.
2.  The widespread representation of a Mother Goddess in terracotta figurines.
3.  The existence of elaborate temples dedicated to various deities.
4.  Evidence of phallus (Linga) worship.
5.  The absence of any evidence of nature worship.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the religious and cultural aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Indus Valley Civilization's religious practices are still being actively researched, but several key aspects are well-documented. The male deity Pasupati, often associated with Shiva in later Hindu traditions, is depicted in a yogic posture on numerous seals, indicating a developed spiritual system. The Mother Goddess, represented through numerous terracotta figurines, suggests a prominent female deity in their pantheon. While elaborate temples haven't been discovered, the presence of standardized artifacts suggests organized religious practices.  Phallus (Linga) worship is also evidenced. Nature worship, evidenced by depictions of animals and trees, was also prevalent. Statement 5 is incorrect, as evidence of nature worship is available. Thus, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) accurately reflect the known religious and cultural aspects, making (c) the correct answer. Distractors focus on the lack of temple discovery and the assumption of absence of nature worship.


**3. Consider the following features of the writing system used in the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The script is primarily alphabetical in nature.
2.  The script has been completely deciphered.
3.  The script is written in a boustrophedon style, alternating between right-to-left and left-to-right directions.
4.  The script consists mostly of ideograms.
5.  The script is primarily pictographic.

How many of these statements are correct regarding the Indus Valley Civilization's writing system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Indus script remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of archaeology.  It is not yet fully deciphered, making statement 2 incorrect. While it shows characteristics of pictographic writing, the exact nature of the script (whether it is purely pictographic, logographic, or a combination) is still debated, rendering statement 4 and 5 partially correct, but not fully.  The boustrophedon style (alternating writing direction) is a confirmed characteristic, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only one statement (3) is definitively correct, making (a) the correct option. Distractors are designed to confuse candidates familiar with other ancient writing systems, playing on the similarities and differences with the Indus script.


**4. Consider the following about Lothal, a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  Located at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.
2.  Famous for its advanced irrigation systems.
3.  Known for its sophisticated urban planning and infrastructure.
4.  Possessed the world's oldest known man-made dry dock.
5.  Significant evidence of extensive metalworking techniques.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Lothal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Lothal is renowned for its advanced features for its time. It's situated near the Gulf of Khambhat, between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers, not the Ganges and Yamuna (statement 1 is incorrect). While sophisticated urban planning and infrastructure are well-documented (statement 3 is correct), its irrigation systems are not the primary focus of archaeological findings (statement 2 is debatable, thus incorrect). The discovery of a man-made dry dock is a significant finding, highlighting Lothal's maritime capabilities (statement 4 is correct). Evidence of metalworking is also present (statement 5 is correct).  Therefore, three statements (3, 4, and 5) correctly describe Lothal. Distractors use geographically close rivers and features common in other Indus cities to mislead.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime activities:**

1.  Nagapattinam served as a significant naval base.
2.  The Cholas lacked a strong navy.
3.  Rajaraja Chola I led naval expeditions to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
4.  Rajendra Chola I extended Chola power to Southeast Asia.
5.  The Chola navy primarily relied on riverine warfare.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Chola Empire's naval capabilities and activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Chola Empire was a maritime power. Nagapattinam was a crucial port and naval base (statement 1 is correct). The Chola navy was powerful, not weak (statement 2 is incorrect). Rajaraja Chola I's naval conquests of Sri Lanka and Maldives are well-documented (statement 3 is correct).  Rajendra Chola I's expeditions extended Chola influence to Southeast Asia, particularly the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (statement 4 is correct).  The Chola navy was primarily sea-based, not confined to rivers (statement 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are correct, making (c) the correct choice. Distractors aim to confuse by contrasting the Chola navy with other contemporary naval forces and focusing on less-emphasized aspects of their maritime activities.


**6. Consider the following about the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The register includes only manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region.

4.  The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
5.  The register aims to preserve globally significant documentary heritage.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the UNESCO's MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register focuses on preserving documentary heritage from the region, but also considers global significance (statement 1 is partially correct, therefore incorrect; statement 5 is correct). The program began in 1992, not 2023 (statement 2 is incorrect).  The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana is confirmed (statement 3 is correct).  The 10th MOWCAP meeting's location is accurate (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, all but statement 2 are correct, making (d) the appropriate answer. Distractors focus on the program's inception date and the specific criteria for inclusion in the register to create confusion.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative:**

1.  The initiative is solely led by the Ministry of Textiles.
2.  The initiative aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.

4.  The initiative is implemented by the Cotton Corporation of India.
5.  The initiative focuses on improving the quality of Indian cotton.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative involving various stakeholders, not solely the Ministry of Textiles (statement 1 is incorrect). Enhancing global competitiveness is a core objective (statement 2 is correct).  Blockchain technology is used for traceability (statement 3 is correct). TEXPROCIL, not the Cotton Corporation of India, is the implementing agency (statement 4 is incorrect).  Improving cotton quality is an integral part of the initiative (statement 5 is correct). Thus, three statements (2, 3, and 5) accurately describe the initiative. Distractors focus on the implementing agency and the exact scope of the initiative to create difficulty.


**8. Consider the following about Project PARI (Public Art of India):**

1.  Project PARI is executed by the Ministry of Culture.
2.  Project PARI's first intervention took place in Mumbai.
3.  Project PARI promotes the democratization of art through public installations.
4.  Project PARI includes traditional art forms like Thangka painting.
5.  Project PARI is primarily focused on showcasing contemporary art.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding Project PARI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Project PARI is executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, not directly by the Ministry of Culture (statement 1 is incorrect). The project's first intervention was in Delhi, not Mumbai (statement 2 is incorrect).  Democratization of art through public installations is a central aim (statement 3 is correct).  The inclusion of Thangka painting and other traditional art forms is mentioned (statement 4 is correct).  While contemporary art is included, the project isn't solely focused on it (statement 5 is partially correct, therefore incorrect).  Therefore, three statements (3, 4, and the partially correct 5) are largely correct, leading to option (c). Distractors play on the executing agencies and the specific types of art forms showcased.


**9. Consider the following regarding the National Handloom Day:**

1.  It commemorates the launch of the Swadeshi Movement in 1905.
2.  It is celebrated annually on August 7th.

5.  The first National Handloom Day was celebrated in 2014.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the facts about National Handloom Day?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The date is correctly linked to the Swadeshi Movement (statement 1 is correct).  The date of celebration (August 7th) is accurate (statement 2 is correct).  The handloom industry is indeed India's largest cottage industry (statement 3 is correct).  However, the majority of handloom workers are women, not men (statement 4 is incorrect). The first celebration was in 2015, not 2014 (statement 5 is incorrect). Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) are correct, making (c) the right answer. Distractors focus on the gender distribution of workers and the exact year of the first celebration.


**10. Consider the following statements about Eri silk:**

1.  It is known as the world's only vegan silk.
2.  It is produced by the silkworm *Bombyx mori*.
3.  It is a Geographical Indication (GI) product of Assam.
4.  It is reared outdoors.
5.  It is a multivoltine silk.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Eri silk?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Eri silk is indeed known as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally (statement 1 is correct). It is produced by *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori* (statement 2 is incorrect). While it can have GI tags from various regions, Assam is a major producer (statement 3 is partially correct, therefore incorrect). It's reared indoors, not outdoors (statement 4 is incorrect).  It is multivoltine, meaning it can produce several crops a year (statement 5 is correct). Thus, only two statements (1 and 5) are entirely correct, making (b) the right choice. Distractors focus on the silkworm species, rearing conditions, and the precise GI tag regions.


**11. Consider the following about Denisovans:**

1.  Denisovans are an extinct species of hominin.
2.  Denisovans interbred with Neanderthals but not with modern humans.
3.  Denisovan remains have been found only in Siberia.
4.  Denisovans are closely related to Neanderthals.
5.  Homo erectus is their most likely common ancestor.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Denisovans?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Denisovans are an extinct hominin species (statement 1 is correct).  DNA evidence shows interbreeding with both Neanderthals and modern humans (statement 2 is incorrect).  Their remains have been found in locations beyond Siberia, including Tibet (statement 3 is incorrect).  Their close relationship to Neanderthals is established (statement 4 is correct).  Their common ancestor is most likely *Homo heidelbergensis*, not *Homo erectus* (statement 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) are entirely correct, making (b) the correct option. Distractors focus on the geographical distribution of remains, interbreeding patterns, and the species of their common ancestor.


**12. Consider the following characteristics of megalithic structures:**

1.  Megaliths are exclusively found in India.
2.  Dolmenoid cists are a type of chamber tomb.
3.  Megalithic builders were typically nomadic pastoralists.
4.  All megaliths are associated with burial practices.
5.  The construction of megaliths ceased during the Iron Age.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding megalithic structures?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Megalithic structures are found globally, not just in India (statement 1 is incorrect). Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of chamber tomb (statement 2 is correct). Many megalithic builders led semi-nomadic pastoralist lives (statement 3 is correct).  Not all megaliths are connected to burials; some served other purposes (statement 4 is incorrect). Megalith construction continued into the Iron Age in some regions (statement 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are entirely correct, making (b) the right answer. Distractors focus on the geographical distribution, the functions of megaliths, and the chronology of their construction.


**13. Consider the following about the Phanigiri site in Telangana:**

1.  Phanigiri is a Buddhist site.
2.  Excavations at Phanigiri have unearthed only Buddhist structures.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Phanigiri archaeological site?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Phanigiri is indeed a Buddhist site (statement 1 is correct).  Excavations revealed various structures beyond purely Buddhist ones (statement 2 is incorrect).  Phanigiri is located near Hyderabad, not Vijayawada (statement 3 is incorrect).  Evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana sects coexisting is present (statement 4 is correct). A coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period, not just Satavahana, was found (statement 5 is partially correct, therefore incorrect).  Therefore, three statements (1, 4, and the partially correct 5) are largely accurate, making (c) the correct option. Distractors focus on the location, the types of structures found, and the specific period of the coin hoard.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Bavikonda Monastery?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Bavikonda is near Visakhapatnam, not Amaravati (statement 1 is incorrect).  Its dating to the 3rd century BCE is accurate (statement 2 is correct). It's a Theravada Buddhist complex (statement 3 is correct).  It's part of the Buddhist Circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme (statement 4 is correct).  While sculptures are present, it's primarily associated with Theravada Buddhism, not extensive Mahayana sculptures (statement 5 is incorrect). Therefore, three statements (2, 3, and 4) are correct, leading to option (c). Distractors play on the location of the monastery and its specific association with Mahayana Buddhism.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  The Holkar Dynasty was part of the Maratha Confederacy.
2.  Ahilyabai Holkar was known for her military conquests.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Holkar Dynasty?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Holkar Dynasty's membership in the Maratha Confederacy is accurate (statement 1 is correct). Ahilyabai Holkar is known for her administrative and developmental work, not primarily military conquests (statement 2 is incorrect). Malhar Rao Holkar II's role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War is historically documented (statement 3 is correct). Ahilyabai Holkar's promotion of the Maheshwari weaving industry is well-known (statement 4 is correct).  The Holkar Dynasty's main seat of power was Maheshwar and Indore, not Pune (statement 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are correct, leading to option (c). Distractors focus on Ahilyabai Holkar's activities and the Dynasty's main location.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Nana Jagannath Shankarseth?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** He was born in a Brahmin family, not a Maratha family (statement 1 is incorrect). His contributions to Mumbai's development are well-documented (statement 2 is correct). His philanthropy and support for education, particularly for girls, are historically significant (statement 3 is correct). He wasn't a prominent figure in the independence movement (statement 4 is incorrect). He wasn't a figure in the Maratha court (statement 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only three statements (2 and 3) are correct, leading to option (c). Distractors focus on his family background and his involvement in major historical movements.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

It is indeed a Ministry of Culture initiative, implemented by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, aiming to make art more accessible through public installations and featuring artwork from numerous artists across India. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the project's first intervention is in Delhi, not Mumbai.  This detail distinguishes the correct answer from the distractors.


**3. Consider the following statements about the ‘Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi’ initiative:**

1. It's a national responsible tourism initiative launched by the Ministry of Tourism.
2. It aims to promote responsible tourism across 50 tourist destinations in India.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the initiative is a national responsible tourism program from the Ministry of Tourism, covering 50 destinations. However, statement 3 is misleading. While responsible tourism inherently incorporates environmental considerations, the initiative's scope isn't exclusively limited to eco-tourism.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the implementation likely involves collaboration with various stakeholders beyond just government agencies.  The combination of partially correct and incorrect statements makes this a challenging question.



**4. Consider the following features of Transhumance:**

1. It's a traditional practice involving the seasonal movement of livestock.
2. It often involves the migration of human communities alongside their herds.
3. It is primarily practiced in arid and semi-arid regions of India.

Statement 4 is also incorrect; while some European transhumance traditions received recognition, no Indian traditions were specifically mentioned as being awarded this status in 2023 within the provided text.  The inclusion of partially true and false statements creates a challenging MCQ.


**5. Consider the following about UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are among the Indian works included.
2. The register aims to preserve and promote the world's documentary heritage.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.  The three Indian literary works were indeed included, the program aims to preserve documentary heritage, and the decision was made at the 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar. However, statement 4 is false; the MOW program maintains international, regional, and national registers. The presence of a false statement among mostly true ones increases the question's difficulty.

1. It commemorates the launch of the Swadeshi Movement in 1905.
2.  It aims to honor handloom weavers and boost the handloom industry.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the day commemorates the Swadeshi Movement and aims to recognize handloom weavers.  However, statement 3 is partially incorrect; while a major employer, the handloom sector is predominantly rural, not urban. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the first celebration was in 2015, not 2010. The combination of correct and partially or completely incorrect statements makes for a more difficult question.



**7. Consider the following concerning Eri Silk:**

1. It is known as the world's only vegan silk due to its production method.
2. It is produced by the silkworm *Philosamia ricini*.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Eri silk is indeed known as vegan silk, is produced by *Philosamia ricini*, and has received Oeko-Tex certification.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Eri silk production is mainly concentrated in Northeast India, not South India and Nepal. The inclusion of a geographically misleading statement increases the difficulty level.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the findings and understanding of Denisovans.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; genetic evidence suggests interbreeding with both Neanderthals and modern humans.  The presence of a false statement concerning interbreeding makes the question more challenging.



**9. Consider the following regarding the Kashi Culture Pathway:**

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The Kashi Culture Pathway is a G20 outcome document focused on combating illicit trafficking, and Section 3 of the 1972 Act supports this. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the pathway's scope isn't limited to repatriation to India but has a broader international focus.  The inclusion of a statement with a limited scope compared to the actual scope of the initiative makes the question more difficult.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The UN declared June 21st as IYD in 2014, India proposed the resolution, and Yoga is indeed one of the six schools of Indian philosophy. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while Yoga's origins are ancient, the systematic study is primarily found in Patanjali's Yogasutra, not the Rigveda.  The inclusion of a statement that misrepresents the primary source of systematic Yoga knowledge makes this a more difficult MCQ.


**11. Consider the following regarding the declaration of Classical Languages in India:**

1.  The Linguistic Experts Committee (LEC) was formed to evaluate languages for classical status.
2.  The criteria for declaring a language as classical were revised in 2024.

4.  The declaration of a language as a classical language comes with benefits like dedicated study centers and academic chairs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The LEC evaluated languages, criteria were revised in 2024, and the declaration offers benefits such as study centers and academic chairs. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while Prakrit and Pali are ancient and significant languages, they were not among the initial languages declared as classical. Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia were the initial languages declared as classical.  The inclusion of this incorrect statement increases the difficulty.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Sangama dynasty founded the empire, Krishnadevaraya's reign was a high point, and the Virupaksha Temple is a notable architectural achievement. However, statement 3 is partially incorrect; while a centralized system existed, the empire also employed the Amara-Nayaka system, which granted significant autonomy to regional commanders. This nuanced aspect of the political structure makes this a more challenging question.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Vivekananda propagated Vedanta, spoke at the Parliament of Religions, and inspired the IISc.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while philosophical discourse was a part of the Ramakrishna Mission's activities, its primary focus was and continues to be on social service. The inclusion of a statement that misrepresents the primary focus of the Ramakrishna Mission adds to the difficulty.

Ratan Tata oversaw substantial revenue growth for the Tata Group, launched the Nano, and Tata Motors received recognition for its vegan car interiors. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Ratan Tata received the Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan, but not the Bharat Ratna. The incorrect award detail increases the question's difficulty.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct; the Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award, the Prime Minister makes recommendations, and it's awarded for outstanding contributions. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the award doesn't include a monetary grant.  The inclusion of this detail about the lack of monetary component adds to the challenge.


**16. Consider the following about the Megalithic Culture of India:**

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Megalithic culture dates back to the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, is associated with iron, and burial practices reveal beliefs about death and the afterlife. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while the Hire Benkal site is significant and under consideration, it's not yet a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The inclusion of the false statement about UNESCO designation increases the question's difficulty.

However, statement 2 is incorrect; while a monarchy existed, the Ahom administration also involved a powerful council of ministers.  The partially incorrect statement about the administrative system increases the difficulty.

Its location, rulers, role in the spice trade, and the origin of the term "calico" are all well-established facts.  This question, while factual, serves as a straightforward test of knowledge about Kozhikode's historical significance.

(d) All four

Statement 1 is correct. The ASI's decision to delist a monument is primarily based on its assessment of whether the monument retains national importance.  If deemed lacking in national significance, it is considered for delisting.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not a formally defined term within the AMASR Act, 1958.  It emerged from usage by the CAG Audit team in their reports.

Statement 3 is correct. Kos Minar No. 13 in Haryana is explicitly mentioned in the provided text as one of the monuments under consideration for delisting.

Statement 4 is correct. Delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act removes the monument from ASI protection and maintenance, thus opening the area to regular construction and urbanization activities.  This is a key consequence of delisting.

Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, focusing on difficult questions with plausible distractors and detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Padma Awards:**

1.  They were instituted in 1954 and are conferred annually on Independence Day.
2.  Awards are given in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, with Padma Vibhushan being the highest.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Padma Awards were instituted in 1954, they are announced annually on Republic Day, not Independence Day.  Statement 2 is correct; these are the three categories, with Padma Vibhushan being the highest honor. Statement 3 accurately reflects the general rule regarding posthumous awards.  Statement 4 is incorrect.  The award does not constitute a title and cannot be appended to a recipient's name. Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly correct statements.  The distractors (options a, b, and d) play on common misconceptions related to the Padma Awards.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Anubhav Awards:**

1.  They are given by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.
2.  They are based on write-ups submitted by retiring central government employees on the Anubhav Portal.

(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the entire Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.  Statement 2 is correct; the awards are based on the experiences shared by retiring employees. Statement 3 is also correct; the aim is to improve governance. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are not given for exceptional service in specific fields but are based on the overall experience and lessons learned throughout a career. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related governmental bodies and understand the specific purpose of the awards.


**3. Consider the following statements about Gallantry Awards:**

1.  The Param Vir Chakra is awarded for acts of bravery in peacetime.
2.  Ashoka Chakra Class-I, II, and III were instituted in 1952 and later renamed in 1967.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Param Vir Chakra is awarded for the most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy, whether on land, at sea, or in the air. It is a wartime gallantry award.  Statement 2 is correct.  Statement 3 is incorrect; they are announced twice a year. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Kirti Chakra ranks higher than the Vir Chakra.

1.  The decision to delist is based solely on the assessment of the ASI.
2.  "Untraceable monuments" are those explicitly defined as such in the AMASR Act, 1958.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, not solely the ASI's assessment. Statement 2 is incorrect; the term "untraceable monuments" is not a formal legal definition within the AMASR Act.

Chinese travelers Fa-Hien and Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) both mention the stupa in their accounts of their travels to India. It is also believed to commemorate the spot where Buddha gave his 22nd sermon and announced his impending death.  Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(a) Only one

The temple's architecture is a blend of styles, including influences from Upper Burma and the Pala style of Bengal, evolving into the Ahom style; it is not primarily Dravidian. The Koch dynasty did reconstruct the temple in the mid-16th century.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.

1.  It is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2. It is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavani rivers and their tributaries.

How many of the above statements are correct?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Sangameshwar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  The temple is indeed situated at the confluence of the Krishna River and Bhavani River, along with five other tributaries.  It was built by the Chalukya dynasty, not the Vijayanagara dynasty. The temple is annually submerged due to the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions within the AMASR Act, 1958?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The AMASR Act, 1958, is a crucial piece of legislation for the preservation of India's historical heritage.  Statement 1 is partially correct; the Act focuses on monuments and sites of national importance, but the criteria for determining national significance are within the purview of the government. Statement 2 is correct; the Act regulates archaeological excavations to ensure responsible and scientific practices. Statement 3 is also correct; Section 35 of the Act allows the Central Government to delist monuments that have ceased to be of national importance, a process recently highlighted by the ASI's intention to delist several "untraceable" monuments.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" is not a formally defined term within the Act; it emerged from CAG audit reports, highlighting the challenges in locating and maintaining some protected monuments.  Therefore, only three statements accurately represent the Act's provisions.

**Explanation:**

Project PARI, an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, aims to bring art to the public. Statement 2 correctly describes its goal of democratizing art through public installations. Statement 3 is also correct; the project includes diverse Indian art forms like Thangka painting. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Project PARI is a joint effort between Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.

**Explanation:**

The "Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi" initiative promotes responsible tourism. Statement 2 is correct; the initiative covers 50 tourist destinations nationwide. Statement 3 is also correct; the Ministry of Tourism launched this national-level initiative.  Statement 1 is incorrect; this is a national-level program, not limited to a single state.

Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the initiative.

**Explanation:**

The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative highlights the importance of transhumance practices. Statement 1 is correct; ICOMOS leads the initiative. Statement 2 accurately defines transhumance.

**Explanation:**

The Kashi Culture Pathway is a significant initiative linked to the G20. Statement 1 is correct; it is an outcome of the G20 Culture Working Group. Statement 3 is also correct; the pathway includes a global coalition to fight against illicit trafficking.  Statement 2 is partially correct; while tourism is a component, the pathway's scope is broader than just tourism promotion. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Indian government plays a key role, funding likely involves international collaboration given its G20 connection. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the Kashi Culture Pathway.

Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect his contributions.  The nuances related to the Satyashodhak Samaj's founding require deeper understanding to avoid misinterpretations.

**Explanation:**

Swami Dayanand Saraswati was a significant social and religious reformer. Statement 1 is correct; he was born in Morvi in 1824.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Kasturi Cotton Bharat directly aims to enhance India's cotton industry's global competitiveness through traceability and branding.  Project PARI focuses on enriching India's cultural landscape by promoting art in public spaces.  The Kakori train action, while a historical event with political implications, indirectly relates to economic aspects by aiming to fund revolutionary activities that could impact the economic structure.  Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi, a responsible tourism initiative, contributes to the economic growth by promoting tourism. Therefore, three out of the four initiatives directly or indirectly relate to economic competitiveness or the cultural sphere.  Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of initiatives with such a focus.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vaikom Satyagraha directly challenged the caste-based exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from temples. The Justice Party Movement and the Self-Respect Movement both explicitly fought against the caste system and Brahminic dominance in society. The Kakori train action, while a significant event in the Indian independence movement, was not directly focused on caste-related issues.  Therefore, three of the listed movements or events directly addressed caste-based inequalities.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent movement, Periyar played a significant role in mobilizing support, and Mahatma Gandhi offered support, particularly in the initial phase. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the Satyagraha contributed significantly to the eventual legal reforms, it did not lead to the immediate abolishment of temple entry restrictions. The Temple Entry Proclamation came much later, in 1936. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.


**5. Consider the following individuals associated with significant movements or events:**

1.  T.K. Madhavan led the Travancore Congress Committee's campaign to lift the ban on temple entry.

However, statement 2 is incorrect; she is primarily known for her extensive temple reconstruction work, not mosques. Statement 4 is also incorrect; she was born in Chondi village, not Maheshwar.

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the NMA.  The NMA is indeed responsible for granting construction permissions in regulated zones near protected monuments (1).

However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While the NMA contributes to the protection of sculptures and artifacts, the primary responsibility for archaeological excavations rests with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), not the NMA.  The NMA focuses on the management and preservation of already identified and protected monuments.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding National Handloom Day:**

1.  It commemorates the launch of the Swadeshi Movement in 1905.
2.  It aims to boost the handloom industry and recognize the contributions of handloom weavers.
3.  The majority of workers in the handloom sector are women.
4.  It was first celebrated in 2015.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect information about National Handloom Day.  The day's selection commemorates the Swadeshi Movement's start on August 7, 1905, aiming to promote Indian-made goods, including handlooms.  The event's core purpose is to honor handloom weavers and revitalize the industry.  The text explicitly states that 70% of handloom workers are women, making statement 3 correct.  Finally, the first National Handloom Day was indeed observed in 2015.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided statements.


**2. Consider the following features of Eri Silk:**

1. It is produced by the Philosamia ricini silkworm.
2. It is considered the world's only vegan silk due to the moth's natural exit from the cocoon.
3.  It is a multivoltine silk, meaning it can be harvested multiple times a year.
4. The North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation obtained Oeko-Tex certification for it.

How many of these features correctly describe Eri Silk?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate descriptions of Eri silk.  The text explicitly identifies *Philosamia ricini* as the silkworm responsible for its production. The unique characteristic of the moth exiting the cocoon without being killed is highlighted, justifying its "vegan silk" status.  The multivoltine nature of the silkworm, allowing for multiple harvests annually, is also mentioned. Finally, the Oeko-Tex certification obtained by the North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation for Eri silk is explicitly stated.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1.  Rajaraja I's conquests extended to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra I's naval campaign reached the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia.
3.  The Chola navy decisively defeated the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
4.  Nagapattinam served as a key trading center for the Chola Empire.

How many of these statements accurately describe the Chola Empire's naval activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. Rajaraja I's conquests of Sri Lanka (annexing the northern part) and the Maldives are documented. Rajendra I's significant expedition against the Sailendra Empire, encompassing regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, is also mentioned. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading hub is explicitly stated.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions Rajaraja I destroying the *Chera* navy, not the Pandya navy, at Kandalursalai.  This makes statement 3 a plausible distractor, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.


**4. Consider the following about Transhumance:**

1. It is a traditional seasonal movement of livestock, often involving human migration.
2.  It is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region of India.
3. Transhumance traditions have been recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.
4.  In India, nomadic tribes like Gujars and Bakarwals practice transhumance with sheep and goats.


Which of the above statements are correct regarding Transhumance?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate reflections of transhumance. The definition of transhumance as seasonal livestock movement with accompanying human communities is correct.  UNESCO's recognition of transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages is also mentioned.  The examples of Gujars and Bakarwals practicing transhumance in the Himalayas are given. However, statement 2 is too limiting. While the Himalayas are mentioned as a key area for transhumance in India, the practice also exists in other plains regions like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh, making statement 2 an oversimplification and a potential distractor.



**5. Consider the following statements related to the Denisovans:**

1. They are an extinct hominid species closely related to Neanderthals.
2.  Their range during the last Ice Age extended from Siberia to Southeast Asia.
3.  Genetic evidence suggests interbreeding between Denisovans and modern humans.
4.  Homo habilis is identified as their common ancestor with Neanderthals and modern humans.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The text clearly states that Denisovans are an extinct hominid species closely related to Neanderthals. Their geographic range during the last Ice Age is described as extending from Siberia to Southeast Asia.  The text also mentions DNA evidence supporting interbreeding between Denisovans and both Neanderthals and modern humans.  However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The text specifies *Homo heidelbergensis*, not *Homo habilis*, as their common ancestor with Neanderthals and modern humans.  This incorrect detail serves as a significant distractor, requiring careful attention to detail.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas manuscript is included in the register.
2.  The register includes manuscripts from 17 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

**Explanation:**  All four statements are correct based on the provided text. The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas manuscript is explicitly mentioned.  The text states that 17 other works from the Asia-Pacific region were also included in the register, along with three Indian literary works. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) in Ulaanbaatar is identified as the location where the decision was made. Finally, the description of the MOW Programme's launch in 1992 and its three-tiered register system (International, Regional, and National) is accurately reflected in the provided information.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the 'Har Ghar Tiranga' campaign and the Flag Code of India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect details related to the 'Har Ghar Tiranga' campaign and the Flag Code of India. The campaign's aim to encourage the display of the national flag at homes is clearly stated. The Flag Code of India, 2002, with its amendments from 2021 and 2022, is correctly identified as the governing document. The 2022 amendment allowing for the display of the flag at any time is accurately stated, as is the range of permitted materials for flag construction (hand-spun and hand-woven cotton, machine-made polyester, wool, silk, or Ichadi bunting).  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present.


**8. Consider the following about the  Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. The Sangama Dynasty was the founding dynasty.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the empire reach its zenith.

4. The Amara-Nayakas were military commanders who ruled territories granted by the Raya.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Sangama Dynasty is identified as the founding dynasty. Krishnadevaraya's reign is associated with the empire's peak.  The Amara-Nayaka system, where military commanders ruled granted territories, is also accurately described. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the *Aravidu* Dynasty, not the Tuluva Dynasty, was marked by internal conflicts.  The incorrect attribution of internal conflicts to the Tuluva Dynasty makes it a plausible distractor.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately describe the Charaideo Moidams.  Their location in the foothills of the Patkai Ranges in Assam, their status as the royal necropolis of the Tai-Ahom dynasty, and their architectural features (earthen mound, octagonal wall, brick-and-stone vault) are all correctly described. The text also mentions their recent inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List, though the exact year is not explicitly provided, the context clearly implies it happened recently.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The description of dolmenoid cists as semi-subterranean chamber tombs is accurate. The association of megalithic structures with the Iron Age due to the common presence of iron artifacts is also correct. The mention of pit burials at the Burzahom site in Srinagar is also accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Megalithic peoples lived a *semi-nomadic* life, and had not been colonized in a defined reserve forest, making statement 4 a significant distractor.


**12. Consider the following about  the Phanigiri site in Telangana:**

1. It is located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad.
2.  Excavations have unearthed a coin hoard from the Ikshvaku period.
3.  It is primarily known as a Buddhist site.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements correctly describe aspects of the Bavikonda Monastery. Its location near Visakhapatnam, its dating to the 3rd century BCE, its Theravada Buddhist nature, and its inclusion in the specified Buddhist Circuit are all explicitly mentioned in the provided text. No inaccuracies or misleading information is present.


**14. Consider the following about the  Olympic Games:**

1. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.
2.  The motto of the Olympic Games is "Faster, Higher, Stronger."
3.  The Olympic flag features five interlocking rings representing the five continents.
4.  India first participated in the Olympics in 1900.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect facts about the Olympic Games?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896. The motto "Faster, Higher, Stronger" is accurate. India's first Olympic participation in 1900 is also correct. However, statement 3 is slightly inaccurate. While the five interlocking rings are a key feature of the Olympic flag, they represent the five *parts* of the world, not the five continents.  This subtle difference makes it a plausible distractor.

The wording of statement 4 makes it a plausible distractor.


**18. Consider the following regarding the  world's oldest calendar discovered at Göbekli Tepe:**

1. It is a solar-lunar calendar.
2.  It was used to track celestial events.
3.  V-shaped symbols represent days, totaling 365.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the calendar?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the calendar. Its solar-lunar nature, its use for tracking celestial events, and the representation of days by V-shaped symbols totaling 365 are all explicitly mentioned. However, statement 4 is slightly inaccurate. The text states the calendar commemorates a comet strike around 10,850 BCE, not 10,950 BCE. This minor numerical discrepancy makes it a plausible distractor, emphasizing the importance of precise factual recall.


**19. Consider the following about the  Gandhi Sarovar (Chorabari Tal) near Kedarnath Temple:**

1. It is located near Kedarnath Temple in Uttarakhand.
2.  A massive avalanche hit the lake recently.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The location of Gandhi Sarovar near Kedarnath Temple in Uttarakhand, the recent avalanche incident, and its original name (Kanti Sarovar) are all accurately mentioned. However, statement 4 is not explicitly supported by the text. While the avalanche impacted the lake, there is no mention of damage to the Kedarnath Temple itself.  This omission makes statement 4 a plausible distractor.


**20. Consider the following  statements about the  National Monuments Authority (NMA):**

1. It is under the Ministry of Culture.
2.  It regulates archaeological excavations.
3.  It grants permissions for construction near centrally protected monuments.

There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Avvaiyar
2.  Nachchellaiyar
3.  Kakkaipadiniyar
4.  Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay

How many of the above are notable female poets associated with the Sangam period or its broader cultural context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar are all renowned female poets from the Sangam period in ancient Tamil Nadu.  Their works offer valuable insights into the society, culture, and beliefs of that era. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, while a significant figure in Indian arts and crafts, is not directly associated with Sangam literature.  Therefore, only three of the listed individuals are notable female poets connected to the Sangam period or its associated cultural sphere. Option (a) is incorrect because it undercounts the number of Sangam poets listed. Option (b) is incorrect as it also undercounts the number of female poets. Option (d) is incorrect because Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay's contributions, while significant, are separate from Sangam literature.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Nalanda University
2.  Vikramshila University
3.  Odantapuri University
4.  Jagaddala University

How many of the above ancient universities were prominent centers of Buddhist learning in India and/or its neighboring regions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nalanda, Vikramshila, Odantapuri, and Jagaddala were all significant ancient universities that played crucial roles in the spread and development of Buddhism.  Nalanda, in particular, was a renowned center of learning attracting scholars from across Asia. Vikramshila was another major university known for its advanced studies, particularly in Buddhist philosophy. Odantapuri, while perhaps less famous than Nalanda or Vikramshila, was a vital center of learning, especially for Tibetan scholars. Jagaddala, located in present-day Bangladesh, also held a prominent position in the Buddhist academic landscape.  Each of these universities contributed substantially to the intellectual and spiritual history of Buddhism, making option (d) the correct answer.  Choosing any other option would neglect the historical significance of at least one of these institutions.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Alagar Temple
2.  Shree Jagannath Temple
3.  Bavikonda Monastery
4.  Chandravalli Cave Complex

How many of the above are significant religious or archaeological sites in India that showcase distinct architectural styles or historical periods?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four sites—Alagar Temple, Shree Jagannath Temple, Bavikonda Monastery, and Chandravalli Cave Complex—are significant in Indian religious or archaeological history and exhibit unique architectural styles or periods. Alagar Temple represents Dravidian architecture and is associated with Vaishnavism. Shree Jagannath Temple exemplifies Kalinga architecture, a substyle of Nagara. Bavikonda Monastery showcases Buddhist architecture of a specific period.  The Chandravalli Cave Complex illustrates a blend of architectural influences from various dynasties and periods, showcasing rock-cut architecture and reflecting multiple historical phases.

(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four sites—Keeladi, Phanigiri, Ooragutta, and Ratnagiri—are significant archaeological sites in India that have provided substantial insights into early Indian history and culture. Keeladi's excavations have revealed evidence of an advanced urban settlement during the Sangam age. Phanigiri has unearthed a coin hoard and remains from the Ikshvaku period, shedding light on ancient political and economic systems. Ooragutta's megalithic structures provide evidence of Iron Age settlements. Ratnagiri, along with Lalitagiri and Udayagiri, forms a significant Buddhist complex, showcasing the flourishing of Buddhism in Odisha. Each site has contributed unique and valuable data to the understanding of India's past, thus making (d) the correct choice.  Any other option would be incorrect, as it would disregard the historical significance of at least one of these sites.

1.  The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958
2.  The Nalanda University Act, 2010
3.  The Flag Code of India, 2002 (amended 2021 & 2022)
4.  The report by the Ministry of Culture on Untraceable Monuments

How many of the above are legal frameworks or documents that govern the protection, preservation, or use of cultural heritage in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the listed items are legal frameworks or documents related to India’s cultural heritage.  The AMASR Act, 1958, is the primary legislation governing the protection of ancient monuments and archaeological sites. The Nalanda University Act, 2010, established the modern Nalanda University, preserving a significant historical site. The Flag Code of India, 2002 (with its amendments), outlines the rules for displaying the national flag, a key element of national identity.  The report by the Ministry of Culture on untraceable monuments is a specific document, not a standing legal framework.  Therefore, only three items fit the description of legal frameworks or documents governing cultural heritage, making (c) the correct answer. Option (d) is incorrect because the report is not a legal framework in itself.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  Adi Shankaracharya
2.  Kumargupta I
3.  Kharavela
4.  Ashoka

How many of the above are historical figures associated with the establishment, patronage, or significant events related to ancient universities or religious institutions in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four individuals—Adi Shankaracharya, Kumargupta I, Kharavela, and Ashoka—are historically linked to the establishment, patronage, or significant events related to ancient universities or religious institutions in India. Adi Shankaracharya established four cardinal mathas, promoting Advaita Vedanta. Kumargupta I is credited with founding Nalanda University. Kharavela, a Kalinga king, is known for his patronage of Jainism and the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves. Ashoka, the Mauryan emperor, is associated with significant events related to Buddhism and its spread.  Therefore, all four individuals have a connection to these aspects of Indian history and culture. Option (d) is the correct answer as it accurately reflects their historical significance.  Any other option would be incorrect because it would undervalue the historical contribution of at least one of these figures.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  Srimukhalingam
2.  Srikurmam
3.  Arasavilli
4.  Danthapuri

How many of the above are locations of significant Hindu temples in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Srimukhalingam, Srikurmam, and Arasavilli are all locations of significant Hindu temples in India.  Danthapuri, on the other hand, is associated with Buddhism.  Therefore, three of the locations are correctly categorized as sites of significant Hindu temples. Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a) and (b) underrepresent the number of Hindu temple sites, while option (d) includes a Buddhist site.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Mahayana Buddhism
2.  Hinayana Buddhism
3.  Vajrayana Buddhism
4.  Theravada Buddhism

How many of the above are branches or schools of thought within Buddhism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Mahayana, Hinayana, Vajrayana, and Theravada are all distinct schools or branches of Buddhism.  While the terms "Hinayana" and "Theravada" are often used interchangeably, they represent different historical and philosophical nuances.  Vajrayana is a distinct form of Tantric Buddhism, and Mahayana represents another major branch. Therefore, all four are correctly categorized as branches of Buddhism.  Any other answer would be incorrect, as it would fail to acknowledge the diverse schools of thought within Buddhism.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  Electro Optical Infrared Payload (EOIR)
2.  Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry payload (GNSS-R)
3.  SiC UV Dosimeter
4.  Portable metal detectors using Californium

How many of the above are payloads or technologies used in satellite missions or related applications?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

EOIR, GNSS-R, and SiC UV Dosimeter are all payloads or instruments used in satellite missions.  Portable metal detectors using Californium, while utilizing a radioactive element, are a terrestrial technology and not a satellite payload. Therefore, three of the listed items are correctly categorized as satellite-related technologies.  Option (c) is the correct answer; any other choice would incorrectly include or exclude satellite technologies.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Bedaquiline
2.  Pretomanid
3.  Linezolid
4.  Moxifloxacin

How many of the above are drugs used in the BPaLM regimen for treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin are all components of the BPaLM regimen for treating MDR/RR-TB.  The regimen's effectiveness lies in its multi-drug approach.  Therefore, all four drugs are correctly identified as part of the treatment.  Any other option would be incorrect because it would omit at least one of the crucial components of the BPaLM regimen.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economic aspects where applicable,  designed to be challenging and incorporating plausible distractors:


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award
2.  The Padma Vibhushan
3.  The UNESCO Prix Versailles
4.  The Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year – Lifetime Achievement Award

How many of the above awards have been conferred upon Ratan Tata?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ratan Tata received the Padma Bhushan (2000), Padma Vibhushan (2008), and the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year – Lifetime Achievement Award (2013).  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is given for lifetime achievement in cinema, and the UNESCO Prix Versailles was awarded to the Kempegowda International Airport, not Ratan Tata personally. Therefore, only two of the listed awards were conferred upon him.  Option (a) is incorrect because he received more than one award. Option (c) is incorrect as he did not receive three awards. Option (d) is incorrect as he did not receive all four awards.


**2. Consider the following statements related to the economic impact of the Tata Group under Ratan Tata's leadership:**

1.  The Tata Group's revenue increased significantly under his leadership.
2.  The Tata Group is one of India's largest employers.
3.  The launch of the Tata Nano significantly boosted India's GDP growth.
4.  The Tata Group's focus on sustainable practices, as evidenced by awards like the PETA India Cow-Friendly Future Award, has had a substantial positive impact on the Indian economy.

Which of the statements above accurately reflect the economic contributions of the Tata Group during Ratan Tata's tenure?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Tata Group's revenue did indeed surge dramatically under Ratan Tata's leadership. Statement 2 is also correct:  The Tata Group remains one of India's largest employers, contributing significantly to the national economy through job creation. Statement 4 is correct: The Tata Group's increasing focus on sustainability, though not directly quantifiable in economic terms in this context, represents a positive trend and aligns with global economic priorities. However, Statement 3 is debatable and likely inaccurate. While the Tata Nano was a significant event, its impact on overall GDP growth was likely less significant than other factors and its economic success is a matter of ongoing debate among economists.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the broader economic contributions of the Tata Group during Ratan Tata's tenure. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the debatable or inaccurate statement about the Tata Nano's GDP impact.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Bharat Ratna:**

Which of the statements are accurate regarding the Bharat Ratna?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Bharat Ratna is indeed conferred by the President of India and can be awarded for outstanding service in any field.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the award does not come with a monetary grant. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the Prime Minister makes recommendations, they aren't formally mandatory. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one false statement about the Bharat Ratna.


**4. Consider the following aspects of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake:**

1.  Magnitude: 7.9 on the Richter scale
2.  Epicenter: Bhuj
3.  Memorial Museum: Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum

Which of the above accurately describe aspects of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale, its epicenter was Bhuj, the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was built in its memory, and Bhujiyo Dungar hill is a prominent geographical feature near the epicenter. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they omit at least one correct statement.


**5. Consider the following features of the Miyawaki method of afforestation:**

1.  Developed by a Japanese botanist named Akira Miyawaki.
2.  Involves planting diverse native tree species at high density.

Statement 4 is incorrect; the method emphasizes native species, not non-native ones. Thus, only three statements are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either undercount or overcount the number of accurate statements.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victory at Kandalursalai.
2.  Rajendra I's annexation of northern Sri Lanka.
3.  Chola conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula.
4.  Chola subjugation of the Maldives.

How many of the above represent significant naval expeditions undertaken by the Cholas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements accurately reflect significant Chola naval expeditions. Rajaraja I's victory at Kandalursalai decisively crippled the Chera navy, demonstrating Chola naval dominance in the region.  Rajendra I's conquest extended Chola control over a substantial portion of Sri Lanka, showcasing their naval power and ability to project force across the sea. The Chola conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra involved large-scale naval operations, illustrating the empire's reach and logistical capabilities across vast distances. Finally, the subjugation of the Maldives further underscores the Chola's mastery of naval warfare and their ability to conquer island territories. The evidence clearly supports the inclusion of all four events as significant Chola naval campaigns.

Statement 3 is correct; transhumance is a significant practice in the Himalayas, involving nomadic tribes. Statement 4 is correct; UNESCO has recognized certain transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following works included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  Arthashastra
2.  Ramayana
3.  Panchatantra
4.  Mahabharata

How many of the above are correctly listed?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly mentions *Panchatantra* as being included in the register. While the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata* are significant Indian literary works, their inclusion in this specific register is not stated. The *Arthashastra* is also a notable work, but again, its presence on this particular register is not mentioned in the text. Therefore, only *Panchatantra* is definitively confirmed.


**4. Consider the following features of the Phanigiri archaeological site:**

1.  Location in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh.
2.  Presence of a Mahastupa.
3.  Evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects.

How many of the above features are accurate descriptions of Phanigiri?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text correctly identifies Phanigiri's location in Telangana and the presence of a Mahastupa, Chaitya Grihas, and viharas.  It also accurately states the co-existence of Mahayana and Hinayana sects. However, the statement about Gupta-period coins is incorrect; the text mentions Ikshvaku period coins. Therefore, only two features are correctly described.


**5. Consider the following about the Bavikonda Monastery:**

1.  Located near Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh.
2.  Dates back to the 3rd century CE.
3.  Features a Theravada Buddhist complex.

**Explanation:** The text correctly states that Bavikonda Monastery is near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, not Amaravati.  It accurately describes the monastery's age (3rd century BCE) and its Theravada Buddhist character.  However, the text does not mention extensive rock-cut sculptures, focusing instead on structures like a Mahastupa and Chaitya Griha.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following about the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  Meluha, mentioned in Mesopotamian records, refers to the region of modern-day Pakistan.
2.  The civilization primarily exported precious stones and imported grains.
3.  The script used was a phonetic script, similar to Sanskrit.
4.  Pasupati, a male deity, is depicted in seals.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Statement 1 is correct; Meluha in Mesopotamian texts referred to the Indus region. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Indus civilization exported grains and pottery, importing copper and precious stones. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Indus script remains undeciphered and its nature (pictographic or phonetic) is debated. Statement 4 is correct; Pasupati is a prominent male deity found in Indus seals. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following about Lothal:**

1.  Located at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
2.  Famous for its advanced irrigation system.
3.  Contained the oldest known man-made dry dock.
4.  Was a major center for cotton textile production.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Lothal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Lothal is situated near the Gulf of Khambat, not at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna. The text does not mention its irrigation system. The text correctly identifies Lothal's dry dock as the oldest known. While cotton was likely important in the Indus Valley, the text doesn't specifically highlight Lothal's role in textile production. Therefore only one statement is entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following features of the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri:**

1.  Built in the Dravidian style of architecture.
2.  Dedicated to a holy trinity including Lord Jagannath, his sister, and brother.
3.  Contains the Ratna Bhandar, a sacred treasury.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The temple's architecture is described as Kalinga style, not Dravidian.  The text correctly notes the trinity of Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra. The Ratna Bhandar is also correctly mentioned. The construction, however, is attributed to Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, not Kharavela.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the Kalinga Dynasty:**

1.  Kalinga was conquered by the Mauryan Empire during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya.
2.  Kharavela, a key ruler, patronized Jainism.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Kalinga's conquest by the Mauryans occurred under Ashoka, not Chandragupta Maurya. Kharavela's patronage of Jainism and the details in the Hathigumpha inscription are accurately described.  However, the Kalinga region included parts of Andhra Pradesh, not West Bengal.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty was the last ruling dynasty.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked the empire's peak.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were solely responsible for agricultural production.
4.  The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi exemplifies Dravidian architecture.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Aravidu dynasty was the last, not the Sangama dynasty. Krishnadevaraya's reign is correctly identified as a period of great power for the empire. The Amara-Nayakas had military and administrative responsibilities, not solely agricultural. The Virupaksha temple's Dravidian architectural style is accurately described. Therefore, two statements are correct.


**11. Consider the following related to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor:**

1.  It connects Dera Baba Nanak in Pakistan to Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib in India.
2.  The agreement establishing the corridor has a fixed, non-renewable term.

4.  It is entirely situated within the Indian territory.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  The corridor connects Dera Baba Nanak in India to Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan (the statement reverses the locations). The agreement's validity can be extended, as indicated in the news. The corridor's purpose for facilitating pilgrimage is accurate. The corridor is not entirely within Indian territory; it crosses the international border.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**12. Consider the following about the Denisovans:**

1.  They are a species of hominid closely related to modern humans.
2.  Their remains have been found exclusively in Siberia.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text correctly identifies Denisovans as a hominid species related to modern humans. Their remains have been found in locations beyond Siberia, such as Tibet.  They interbred with both Neanderthals and modern humans. Their common ancestor is identified as Homo heidelbergensis, not Homo habilis.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**13.  Consider the following ancient universities:**

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Vikramshila's primary contribution was to Buddhist studies, not Jainism. While the exact founding date of Nalanda is debated, it predates the 7th century. Odantapuri's attraction to Tibetan scholars is correctly stated. Nagarjunakonda's association with Mahayana Buddhism is also accurate. Therefore, three statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The lake is near Kedarnath Temple, not Badrinath. The glacier origin and the legend of Shiva teaching yoga are correctly stated. The text doesn't mention the Alaknanda River as its source.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**15. Consider the following regarding the Sangameswar Temple:**

1.  It is located in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh.
2.  It is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
3.  It is situated at the confluence of multiple rivers.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The temple's location is correctly given as Nilachal hills, but in Assam, not Odisha.  The architectural blend and the Ambubachi Mela's significance are accurately described. The temple's status as a Shakti Peetha is also correct.  Therefore, three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Chola naval expeditions under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.
2.  The annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka by the Cholas.
3.  The establishment of Nagapattinam as a key trading center.
4.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.

How many of the above accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval dominance and territorial expansion.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, prominent Chola rulers, significantly expanded the empire's naval power through aggressive military policies.  Their naval expeditions resulted in the conquest and annexation of territories, including the northern part of Sri Lanka, which became a Chola province under Rajendra I.  Nagapattinam served as a crucial trading center, highlighting the economic benefits derived from the Chola's control of maritime routes.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai demonstrates the Chola's military prowess and ability to subdue rival naval forces.  Therefore, all four statements are factually correct and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the Chola Empire's maritime achievements.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Transhumance in 10 European States.
2.  Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland.
3.  Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas nomadic tribes of the Himalayas.
4.  The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).

Which of the above are associated with the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative or related transhumance practices?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, focuses on the traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement and the migration of human communities with their herds.  Statements 1 and 2 correctly identify two transhumance traditions recognized as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023. Statement 3 mentions specific nomadic tribes in the Himalayas who practice transhumance, moving their animals between subalpine/alpine pastures in summer and adjoining plains in winter, thus directly relating to the initiative's core theme.  Statement 4 correctly names ICOMOS, the leading organization behind this initiative.  Therefore, all four statements are directly or indirectly connected to the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative or its related concepts.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The *Ramcharitmanas*.
2.  The *Panchatantra*.
3.  The *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*.

How many of the above are associated with UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* are three Indian literary works included in UNESCO's MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, is where the decision to include these and other works was made. While the meeting is relevant to the context, it is the inclusion of the manuscripts themselves that is the core focus of the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. Therefore, three of the listed items are directly associated with the register.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Amoghasiddhi.
2.  Bhumisparsha.
3.  Dhyana Mudra.
4.  Dharmachakrapravartana.

How many of the above are associated with mudras and their meanings in Buddhism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four terms relate to Buddhist mudras and their symbolic meanings. Amoghasiddhi is the fifth Dhyani Buddha often depicted using the Abhaya mudra (fearlessness). Bhumisparsha (calling the earth to witness) is a significant mudra associated with the Buddha's enlightenment. Dhyana Mudra represents meditation, and Dharmachakrapravartana symbolizes the preaching of the Dhamma.  Therefore, all four options are correctly linked to Buddhist mudras and their interpretations.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA.
2.  The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972.
3.  Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention.
4.  The Kashi Culture Pathway.

How many of the above are related to efforts to prevent the smuggling of antiquities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements relate to efforts to combat the illicit trafficking of antiquities.  The India-US Cultural Property Agreement directly addresses the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities to the USA. The Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, is a national-level legal framework in India to prevent the export of antiquities. Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention provides an international legal basis for preventing the illicit import, export, and transfer of cultural property. The Kashi Culture Pathway, endorsed by the G20, supports a global coalition against illicit trafficking.  Therefore, all four elements contribute to the broader effort of preventing the smuggling of antiquities.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The Summer Solstice.
2.  The word "Yoga" derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj."
3.  Patanjali's *Yogasutra*.
4.  Cultural diplomacy.

How many of the above are associated with International Yoga Day or related concepts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

International Yoga Day is celebrated on June 21st, which coincides with the Summer Solstice. The word "Yoga" and its meaning ("to join") are central to understanding the practice. Patanjali's *Yogasutra* is a significant text in the history of yoga.  Yoga's role in cultural diplomacy highlights its use as a tool for promoting understanding between nations.  Therefore, all four elements are directly or indirectly connected to International Yoga Day or the broader concept of yoga and its significance.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  Dolmenoid cists.
2.  Chamber tombs.
3.  Unchambered tombs.

How many of the above are types of megaliths?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four options represent types of megaliths. Dolmenoid cists are a specific type of chamber tomb (semi-subterranean). Chamber tombs and unchambered tombs are broad categories of megalithic structures, and megaliths not connected with burials represent another category, highlighting the diversity of megalithic constructions beyond funerary purposes.  Therefore, all four are recognized types or classifications within the broader category of megaliths.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Ikshvaku period.
2.  A Mahastupa.

The Phanigiri site in the Suryapet district of Telangana is associated with the Ikshvaku period, as evidenced by the unearthed coin hoard.  Excavations at Phanigiri have revealed a Mahastupa, along with other structures such as Chaitya Grihas and viharas.  Brahmi label inscriptions dating back to the Satavahana and Ikshvaku periods have also been discovered at the site. Therefore, all four elements are directly linked to the Phanigiri archaeological site and its historical significance.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The Swadesh Darshan Scheme.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bavikonda Monastery, located near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, is part of the Buddhist Circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.  It features a Theravada Buddhist complex with various structures. The name "Bavikonda" translates to "hill of wells," reflecting the presence of numerous wells at the site in the past.  Therefore, all four statements accurately describe aspects of the Bavikonda Monastery and its historical context.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  A bearded man statue from Mohenjo-daro.
2.  A red sandstone male torso from Harappa.
3.  Terracotta figurines of a Mother Goddess.

How many of the above are associated with archaeological finds from the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indus Valley Civilization is known for its distinctive artifacts.  Archaeological excavations have unearthed stone statues, including a bearded man (interpreted as a priest) from Mohenjo-daro and a red sandstone male torso from Harappa.  Numerous terracotta figurines, including representations of a Mother Goddess, have also been discovered.  However, the pictographic script of the Indus Valley Civilization remains undeciphered. Therefore, three of the listed items are accurately associated with archaeological finds from the Indus Valley Civilization.


**11. Consider the following:**

1.  The oldest man-made dry dock.
2.  The Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers.
3.  The Gulf of Khambat.

(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lothal, a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization, is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambat.  It is famous for possessing the oldest known man-made dry dock. The NMHC at Lothal is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme.  Therefore, all four elements are linked either to Lothal itself or to the project to develop the National Maritime Heritage Complex there.


**12. Consider the following:**

1.  The 2001 Gujarat Earthquake.
2.  The Bhujiyo Dungar hill.
3.  The Miyawaki method.

(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was built in memory of the victims of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake.  It is located on the Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat. The museum incorporates one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests, utilizing the Miyawaki method of rapid forest growth. While the museum itself did receive recognition, it is not the subject of a UNESCO Prix Versailles award. Therefore, three of the listed items are directly linked to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum.


**13. Consider the following:**

1.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award.
2.  A Golden Lotus medallion.
3.  The Directorate of Film Festivals.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in cinema, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals.  The award includes a Golden Lotus medallion as part of the recognition.  Mithun Chakraborty is a recipient of the award. Therefore, all four elements are directly related to the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and its associated aspects.

How many of the above are associated with National Handloom Day or Eri silk?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

National Handloom Day commemorates the Swadeshi Movement, which was launched on 7th August 1905, and promoted Indian-made products, including handloom textiles.  While Eri silk is a type of handloom product and has received Oeko-Tex certification, the certification itself isn't directly tied to the *origins* of National Handloom Day. Therefore, three elements are directly associated with the origins or themes of National Handloom Day.


**15. Consider the following:**

1.  Philosamia ricini.
2.  Vegan silk.
3.  Mulberry silk.
4.  The North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Eri silk is renowned as the world's only vegan silk because the silkworm (Philosamia ricini) is not killed to harvest the silk.  The North Eastern Handicrafts and Handlooms Development Corporation obtained Oeko-Tex certification for its Eri silk production. While mulberry silk is another type of silk, it is distinct from Eri silk. Therefore, three of the provided options are directly associated with Eri silk and its production.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FIDE, the world chess federation, currently has its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.  It was initially founded in Paris. Its motto is "Gens una Sumus" ("We are one family"). The T20 World Cup is unrelated to FIDE.  Therefore, three of the listed items are correctly associated with FIDE.

However, the award is not limited to traditional architectural styles; it embraces innovative and contemporary designs that meet the specified criteria.  Statement 4 is therefore incorrect. Option (a) accurately captures the essence of the Prix Versailles Award.

A notable feature of the museum is its inclusion of one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.  However, the museum's primary focus is on commemorating the earthquake and its impact, not on preserving Gujarati handicrafts, making statement 4 incorrect. Option (a) precisely reflects the key aspects of the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum.

(d) 1 and 4 only

The award was instituted in 1969 to celebrate the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke, the 'father of Indian cinema'.  However, the recipient receives a Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion, not a silver one, making statement 4 incorrect. Option (a) accurately reflects the key features of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award.

1.  Empowered all ginners in India to produce Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand.
2.  Utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.
3.  A joint initiative by the Ministry of Textiles and the Cotton Corporation of India.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative empowered all ginners in India to produce the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand, ensuring premium quality and traceability through blockchain technology.  It's a joint venture involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, and other industry stakeholders.  The initiative aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton and create a sustainable ecosystem.  However, it doesn't focus primarily on exporting raw cotton but on branding, traceability, and certification of Indian cotton throughout its value chain, making statement 4 incorrect.  Option (a) accurately describes the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.


**12. Consider the following:**

1.  Initiated by the Ministry of Culture for the World Heritage Committee Meeting.
2.  Executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.
3.  Promotes democratization of art through public installations.
4.  Focuses exclusively on traditional Indian art forms.


Which of the above statements accurately describe Project PARI (Public Art of India)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Project PARI, initiated by the Ministry of Culture, aims to democratize art through public installations in urban landscapes.  It's executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. While it includes various traditional art forms, Project PARI is not exclusively limited to them; it also showcases contemporary art, making statement 4 incorrect.  Option (a) accurately reflects the main goals and features of Project PARI.


**13. Consider the following:**

1.  Launched as a national responsible tourism initiative.
2.  Aims to enhance tourist experiences through "tourist-friendly" people.
3.  Places special emphasis on training women and youth.
4.  Primarily focuses on attracting international tourists.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative is a national responsible tourism program designed to improve the overall tourist experience by training local people to act as welcoming ambassadors.  It emphasizes the training of women and youth to create new tourism-related products and services. While it aims to attract both domestic and international tourists, the initiative's primary focus is not exclusively on international tourists, making statement 4 incorrect.  Option (a) accurately captures the core aspects of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative.


**14. Consider the following:**

1.  Originates from Greek and Roman mythology.
2.  Depicted with scales and a sword.
3.  The blindfold represents impartiality.
4.  Was unveiled recently at the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the above statements accurately describe Lady Justice?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The concept of Lady Justice has its roots in Greek and Roman mythology, representing justice and fairness. She is typically depicted with scales in one hand and a sword in the other. The blindfold, added during the Renaissance, symbolizes impartiality and objectivity in judgment. While a new Lady Justice statue was recently unveiled at the Supreme Court of India, this is a contemporary event related to the enduring symbol, not a defining characteristic of Lady Justice herself. Statement 4 is therefore contextually specific and not a fundamental element of the concept of Lady Justice.  Option (a) offers the most accurate description of the core elements of Lady Justice.


**15. Consider the following statements related to the Ancient Nalanda University:**

1. Founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE.
2.  A monastic university known as a Mahavihara.
3.  Its library, "Dharma Gunj," held over nine million books.
4. Primarily focused on teaching Vedic scriptures only.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Ancient Nalanda University?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ancient Nalanda University was indeed founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE and served as a significant center of learning for centuries. It was a monastic university, a Mahavihara, with residential and educational buildings, stupas, and shrines.  Its library, "Dharma Gunj," or "Mountain of Truth," was legendary for its vast collection of books, said to contain millions of texts.  However, the university's curriculum was not limited to Vedic scriptures only. It encompassed a wide range of subjects, including Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and military strategy. Statement 4 is therefore inaccurate.  Three of the statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Ancient Nalanda University.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on factual recall, analysis, and the ability to distinguish between closely related concepts.  Note that the difficulty is intentionally high, requiring precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding awards conferred in India:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is conferred posthumously only in exceptional cases.
2. The Padma Awards are given in three categories, including Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.
3. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Ministry of Culture for exceptional contributions to literature and arts.
4. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award includes a cash prize.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While initially not conferred posthumously, the Bharat Ratna can now be awarded posthumously.  Statement 2 is correct; the Padma Awards are indeed categorized as Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Anubhav Awards are given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Culture, and are based on the experiences shared by retiring central government employees. Statement 4 is correct; the Dadasaheb Phalke Award does include a cash prize. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are correct.


**2. Consider the following personalities and their significant contributions:**

1.  Swami Vivekananda:  Known for his address at the World's Parliament of Religions and establishing the Ramakrishna Mission.
2.  Ratan Tata:  Headed a conglomerate that launched the Tata Nano and significantly increased its revenue.
3.  P.V. Narasimha Rao:  Recipient of the Bharat Ratna and known for his economic reforms.
4.  Ruskin Bond:  Awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship and authored numerous books.
5.  Atisha Dipankara:  A prominent figure in the revival of Buddhism in Tibet and associated with Vikramshila University.


How many of the above personalities are associated with significant contributions in the field of philosophy or religious thought?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) More than three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Swami Vivekananda's contributions are directly related to philosophy and religious thought through his Vedanta teachings and his influential address. Atisha Dipankara is directly linked to Buddhism and its revival in Tibet. The others, while notable figures, are primarily known for their contributions in business (Ratan Tata), politics (P.V. Narasimha Rao), and literature (Ruskin Bond). Therefore, only two (Swami Vivekananda and Atisha Dipankara) are primarily associated with philosophy or religious thought.


**3. Consider the following features of ancient Indian Universities:**

1. Nalanda: Famous for its Buddhist studies and attracting scholars from across Asia.
2. Vikramshila: Known for its association with Atisha Dipankara and its prominence in Buddhist studies.
3. Takshashila:  A renowned center for learning in various fields including medicine, military science, and philosophy.
4.  Odantipuri:  Established in the 8th century and known for its contribution to Buddhist scholarship.
5.  Nagarjunakonda: A significant center for Mahayana and Tantrayana Buddhism.


How many of the above were prominent centers of Buddhist learning?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Nalanda, Vikramshila, Odantipuri, and Nagarjunakonda were all significant centers of Buddhist learning. While Takshashila was a renowned university, its focus wasn't exclusively on Buddhist studies; it encompassed a wider range of disciplines.  Therefore, four of the listed universities were prominent centers of Buddhist learning.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding awards and recognitions:**

1.  The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award recognizes achievements in contemporary architecture.
2.  The National Film Awards are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
3.  The Gallantry Awards are announced only once a year on Republic Day.
4.  The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor conferred by the Sahitya Akademi on a writer.


How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Prix Versailles Award focuses on contemporary architecture. Statement 2 is also correct; the Directorate of Film Festivals administers the National Film Awards. Statement 3 is incorrect; Gallantry Awards are announced twice a year, on Republic Day and Independence Day. Statement 4 is correct; the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is indeed the highest honor. Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following about the Chola Empire:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I significantly expanded the empire's naval power.
2.  Nagapattinam served as a key trading center during the Chola period.
3.  The Chola Empire primarily relied on land-based military strategies.
4.  Rajendra Chola I led naval expeditions to Southeast Asia.


How many of these statements correctly describe aspects of the Chola Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire. Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I significantly expanded the empire's naval power and launched expeditions. Nagapattinam was indeed a major trading center. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Chola Empire's power was significantly based on its strong naval capabilities.  Therefore, three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following features of a classical Indian dance form:**

1. Originated in a village in Andhra Pradesh.
2. Traditionally performed by men, now predominantly by women.
3. Characterized by quick movements and expressive eye work.
4. Involves a dance move performed on a brass plate using the feet.

Which dance form is described above?

(a) Bharatnatyam
(b) Kuchipudi
(c) Mohiniyattam
(d) Odissi

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description clearly points to Kuchipudi.  It originates in the Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh. Historically a male-dominated art form, it has seen a significant shift towards female performers.  The dance is known for its fast-paced movements and expressive eyes, a crucial aspect of its aesthetic appeal.  Finally, the mention of "Tarangam," a dance move performed on the edge of a brass plate, is a unique characteristic of Kuchipudi.  The other options, while classical Indian dance forms, do not possess all these features. Bharatnatyam, Odissi, and Mohiniyattam have distinct origins, stylistic features, and traditions.


**2. Consider the following statements about a specific type of rock art:**

1. It is approximately 3000 years old.
2. It utilizes inorganic white pigment mixed with natural gum.
3. It is located inside a cave, unlike typical rock shelters.
4. It depicts scenes of elephants, chariots, and aspects of early life.

Which type of rock art is described above?

(a)  Ajanta murals
(b)  Kerala mural paintings
(c)  Kumittipathi rock art
(d)  Sohrai paintings

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The features described accurately match Kumittipathi rock art. Its age, the use of inorganic white pigment (Kumittipathi) with natural gum as a binder, its unusual cave location, and the depiction of elephants, chariots, and early human life all align with this specific art form.  Ajanta murals are known for their vibrant colours and narrative scenes from Buddhist Jataka tales, unlike the described monochromatic style and subject matter. Kerala mural paintings, while also featuring mythological scenes, are distinct in their style and use of colour. Sohrai paintings, a tribal art form from Jharkhand, are characterized by their depiction of agrarian life on mud walls, not the cave setting and subject matter described.


**3. Consider the following elements related to a specific historical dynasty:**

1.  Established by a Shan prince from Mong Mao.
2.  Heavily relied on a Council of Ministers, even in a monarchy.
3.  Adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement.
4.  Ruled until the Burmese invasion and subsequent British annexation.

Which dynasty is described above?

(a)  Chera Dynasty
(b)  Pallava Dynasty
(c)  Ahom Dynasty
(d)  Vijayanagara Dynasty

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The description perfectly fits the Ahom Dynasty of Assam.  Its founder, Sukaphaa, was indeed a Shan prince who migrated from Mong Mao.  The Ahom political system, although a monarchy, placed significant power in the hands of the Patra Mantris (Council of Ministers).  The dynasty's cultural influence included the adoption and patronage of Shaivism and Shaktism, leading to the construction and rebuilding of many temples in Assam. Finally, the Ahom rule ended with the Burmese invasion and the subsequent British annexation following the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826. The other options do not share this unique combination of characteristics.


**4. Consider the following characteristics of a particular type of puppetry:**

1.  Often larger than glove puppets.
2.  Manipulated by rods from below.
3.  Common in West Bengal and Odisha.
4.  May depict social themes or stories from mythology.

What type of puppetry is described?

(a) Glove puppets
(b) Rod puppets
(c) Shadow puppets
(d) String puppets

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description points to rod puppets.  The size, manipulation method (rods from below), geographical prevalence (West Bengal and Odisha), and potential subject matter (social themes and mythological stories) are all hallmarks of rod puppetry. Glove puppets, while sometimes depicting similar themes, are smaller and manipulated differently. Shadow puppets use light and translucent figures, while string puppets are suspended and controlled by strings.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding a specific type of textile art:**

1. It is a religious folk art form.
2. It features the divine feminine at its center.
3. It is primarily associated with the Vaghari community.
4. It uses maroon, black, and white pigments applied with bamboo-stick pens.

Which art form is being described?

(a)  Madhubani Painting
(b)  Kalamkari Painting
(c)  Warli Painting
(d)  Mata ni Pachedi

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The description aligns perfectly with Mata ni Pachedi.  It's a religious textile art form from Gujarat, centered around the depiction of the divine feminine, and strongly connected to the Vaghari community. The use of maroon, black, and white pigments applied with kalam (bamboo-stick pens) is a distinctive characteristic of this art form. While Kalamkari also uses kalam, its style and themes differ significantly. Madhubani and Warli paintings are distinct art forms with unique styles and geographical origins.


**1. Consider the following statements about Sangameshwar Temples:**

1.  A Sangameshwar Temple is located in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, and submerges annually.
2.  The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal was built by the Chalukya dynasty at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers.
3.  There are Sangameshwar temples located in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) All three  (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually accurate.  The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is indeed known for its annual submergence due to the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.  Historical accounts confirm its construction by the Chalukya dynasty at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with five other tributaries.  The text explicitly mentions the existence of other Sangameshwar temples in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, further validating statement 3.  There is no contradictory information presented to dispute these facts.


**2. Consider the following features of Mohiniyattam:**

1.  It is a classical solo dance form traditionally performed only by men.
2.  It originated in the Kuchipudi village of Andhra Pradesh.
3.  Its major themes include love and devotion to Lord Vishnu or Krishna.
4. It uses instruments like Maddalam, Mridangam, and Veena.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding Mohiniyattam?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 3 and 4 are correct. Mohiniyattam is a classical solo dance form of Kerala, traditionally performed by women, not men (Statement 1 is incorrect).  It originates in Kerala, not Kuchipudi (Statement 2 is incorrect).  The description clearly states that major themes are love and devotion to Lord Vishnu or Krishna (Statement 3 is correct), and it lists Maddalam, Mridangam, and Veena among the instruments used (Statement 4 is correct). The other options misrepresent key aspects of the dance form.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Kamakhya Temple:**

1.  It is located on the Nilachal hills in Assam.
2.  It was originally built in the 17th century by the Koch dynasty.
3.  Its architecture is solely in the Nilachal style.
4.  It is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas.

How many of the statements above accurately describe the Kamakhya Temple?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The Kamakhya Temple is indeed situated on the Nilachal hills in Assam, and it is recognized as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas. However, the temple's reconstruction in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty refutes statement 2; while the architectural style is a blend of Nilachal, Upper Burma, Pala, and Ahom styles, it's not solely Nilachal (statement 3 is incorrect). The other options incorrectly represent crucial details about the temple's history and architecture.


**4. Consider the following about the Virupaksha Temple:**

1.  It is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, a form of Vishnu.
2.  It is located in Hampi, Karnataka, which was the capital of the Chola kingdom.
3.  It's a prime example of Nagara-style temple architecture.
4.  Its earliest shrine was built in the 740s CE.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the Virupaksha Temple?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, a form of Shiva, not Vishnu (Statement 1 is incorrect).  Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom, not the Chola kingdom (Statement 2 is incorrect).  The temple showcases Dravida style, not Nagara style architecture (Statement 3 is incorrect).  However, inscriptions suggest the earliest shrine was indeed built around 740 CE (Statement 4 is correct).  The other options include significant inaccuracies regarding the temple's deity, kingdom, and architectural style.


**5. Consider the following about  Kamakhya Temple's Ambubachi Mela:**

1.  The festival commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya.
2. The festival is celebrated in the month of Kartik.
3.  The temple is located on the banks of the Brahmaputra River.
4. The temple architecture is a mix of several styles.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Ambubachi Mela does indeed commemorate the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya.  The temple's location on the Nilachal hills, not on the banks of the Brahmaputra, makes statement 3 incorrect. The temple's architecture is a blend of styles, making statement 4 correct. The  Ambubachi Mela is celebrated in the Assamese month of Ashadha, which corresponds to June-July, not Kartik (October-November). Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ambubachi Mela and the Kamakhya Temple.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Kedarnath Temple:**

1. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2. It is located in the state of Uttarakhand.
3. It is a part of the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit.
4.  Its origins are linked to the Chorabari Bamak Glacier.

How many of these statements are accurate?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Kedarnath Temple is indeed located in Uttarakhand and forms part of the Char Dham circuit. Its association with the Chorabari Bamak Glacier is also well-established. However, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu (Statement 1 is incorrect). The other options incorrectly represent the deity associated with the temple and introduce misleading information.


**7. Consider the following about the  Gandhi Sarovar:**

1. It was originally known as the Kanti Sarovar.
2. It is located in the state of Gujarat.
3. It is believed to be associated with Lord Shiva imparting yoga knowledge.
4. It originates from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier.


How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  Gandhi Sarovar was indeed originally known as Kanti Sarovar, and the text mentions a belief linking the lake to Lord Shiva's imparting of yoga knowledge. However, the lake's location is not explicitly stated as Gujarat (Statement 2 is not definitively supported by the text), and its origin is linked to the Chorabari Bamak Glacier which is associated with Kedarnath, not Gandhi Sarovar. Therefore, only two statements are definitively correct.


**8. Consider the following dance forms:**

1.  Kuchipudi originated in Kerala and is known for its slow, graceful movements.
2.  Mohiniyattam is a classical solo dance form of Andhra Pradesh.
3.  Kalaripayattu is an ancient martial art form from Kerala.
4.  Bharatanatyam is one of the eight classical dance forms of India.

How many of the above statements correctly describe these dance forms?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. Kalaripayattu is indeed an ancient martial art from Kerala, and Bharatanatyam is among the eight recognized classical dance forms of India.  However, Kuchipudi originated in Andhra Pradesh, and is known for its quick movements, not slow ones (Statement 1 is incorrect). Mohiniyattam is from Kerala, not Andhra Pradesh (Statement 2 is incorrect).  Therefore, only three statements are factually accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding Vachana Literature:**

1.  The term "Vachana" literally means "that which is written."
2.  It is primarily associated with the state of Karnataka.
3.  Fa.Gu. Halakatti is a significant figure in its revitalization.
4.  It is primarily composed in Sanskrit.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Vachana Literature is strongly associated with Karnataka, and Fa.Gu. Halakatti is noted for his contributions to its revival. However, "Vachana" literally means "that which is spoken," not written (Statement 1 is incorrect).  It's primarily in Kannada, not Sanskrit (Statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements are factually accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding prehistoric rock art in India:**

1.  The earliest paintings are from the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period.
2.  The Mesolithic period paintings predominantly depict hunting scenes.
3.  Bhimbetka is a site known for Upper Paleolithic rock paintings.
4.  Rock art in Tamil Nadu is exclusively found in open rock shelters.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Mesolithic period paintings do show hunting scenes, and Bhimbetka is a significant site for Upper Paleolithic art. However, the earliest paintings are from the Upper Paleolithic period (Statement 1 is incorrect), and Tamil Nadu's Kumittipathi rock art is found inside a cave, not only in open shelters (Statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian gold industry:**

1.  Bihar possesses the most substantial reserves of primary gold ore in India.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: India's significant cultural affinity for gold and its substantial population contribute to its position as the world's largest gold consumer.  Statement 3 is also correct; while the exact ranking of gold exporters fluctuates, these three nations consistently feature among the leading exporters. Statement 4 is correct because the Tirupati laddu's GI tag highlights its unique origin and quality.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while Bihar might have gold deposits, it's not necessarily the largest holder of primary gold ore in India.  Other states, like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, also have significant gold reserves. The question is designed to test knowledge of gold industry facts, geographical indications, and India's economic position in the global gold market.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct statements.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's economic relations, social policies, or historical discoveries?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are factually correct.  Statement 1 highlights a crucial aspect of India's economic engagement with ASEAN. Statement 2 correctly describes a significant historical event pertaining to social justice and political representation in India. Statement 3 focuses on the implementation of the FRA and its impact on tribal communities. Statement 4 describes a recent archeological finding with implications for understanding India's historical past. The question tests knowledge of various domains – international trade, social policy, and historical discoveries – illustrating interdisciplinary linkages within the UPSC syllabus.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and related institutions:**

1. The GST Council is a constitutional body established under Article 279A of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Union Finance Minister chairs the GST Council.
3.  Small Savings Instruments (SSIs) include the Public Provident Fund (PPF), Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme, and Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP).
4.  The Intellectual Property Awards are given by the Ministry of Finance and evaluate patent applications, grants, and commercialization.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India's tax system, financial instruments, and intellectual property rights?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The GST Council's constitutional basis, the Union Finance Minister's role as Chairperson, and the inclusion of PPF, Sukanya Samriddhi, and KVP as SSIs are all accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the evaluation criteria mentioned are correct, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, not the Ministry of Finance, grants the Intellectual Property Awards. This question tests knowledge about India's economic policies and administrative structures.  The inclusion of plausible distractors (like the incorrect ministry in statement 4) makes it a challenging question.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding  India's economic sectors and policies:**

1.  Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) are connected to the core banking system (CBS).
2.  A village can have only one PACS.
3.  Technical textiles are manufactured using both natural and man-made fibers.
4.  Technical textiles are known for cost-effectiveness, durability, high strength, and lightweight properties.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  PACS are increasingly being integrated into the CBS for better financial management and transparency. Technical textiles utilize a blend of natural and synthetic fibers to achieve specific performance characteristics.  Their desirable qualities—cost-effectiveness, durability, high strength, and lightweight nature—are widely recognized. Statement 2 is incorrect; multiple PACS can exist within a single village, depending on its size and population. This question delves into the agricultural credit system and the technical textile sector, requiring a nuanced understanding of both.  The incorrect statement acts as a distractor.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise knowledge and the ability to analyze information critically.  The explanations provide a deeper understanding of the concepts and the rationale behind the correct answers, mirroring the style of UPSC examination questions.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI:

1. The decision to delist is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture assessing the lack of national importance.
2.  Delisting implies the monument will no longer receive conservation from the ASI under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958.
3. The term "Missing Monuments" is formally recognized within the AMASR Act.
4. Kos Minar No. 13 in Haryana is among the monuments slated for delisting.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The ASI's decision to delist the "untraceable" monuments is explicitly based on a Ministry of Culture report determining their lack of national significance. Statement 2 is also correct. Delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act removes ASI's conservation responsibilities. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the term "Missing Monuments" is not a formal term in the AMASR Act, but rather a term used by the CAG Audit team. Statement 4 is correct; Kos Minar No. 13 is specifically mentioned as a monument facing delisting. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


2. Consider the following initiatives related to Indian cotton and textiles:

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat utilizes blockchain technology for traceability and certification.
2. Project PARI, under the Ministry of Culture, focuses on promoting public art installations in urban landscapes.
3. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative aims to improve the tourist experience through trained local ambassadors.
4.  The Geographical Indications Registry in Chennai grants GI tags to various products.

Which of the above initiatives are directly related to enhancing the quality, promotion, or traceability of Indian textiles or cotton?

(a) 1 and 4 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 1 only (d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Kasturi Cotton Bharat is explicitly focused on improving the quality, traceability, and global competitiveness of Indian cotton through a certified brand and blockchain technology.  This directly addresses the question's criteria. Project PARI promotes public art, unrelated to textiles. Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi aim to improve tourism, not textiles. While GI tags (statement 4) can apply to textiles, the initiative itself is broader than just textile promotion.  Therefore, only Kasturi Cotton Bharat directly relates to improving Indian textiles.


3. Consider the following aspects of the Chola Empire:

1. Rajaraja Chola's naval expeditions included conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
2. The Chola Empire's capital was located in Thanjavur.
3. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia.
4. Nagapattinam served as a major port and trading center for the Chola Empire.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate descriptions of the Chola Empire. Rajaraja Chola's naval dominance is well-documented, including conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives (1). While the provided text doesn't explicitly state Thanjavur as the *sole* capital, it's widely recognized as a significant capital city (2). Rajendra I's expansion into Southeast Asia, encompassing the Sailendra Empire, is historically accurate (3). Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading port for the Cholas is also established (4).


4. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:

1.  It empowers the Central Government to declare monuments of national importance.
2.  It regulates archaeological excavations and protects associated artifacts.
3.  The Act defines the term "Missing Monuments."
4. The National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established by the AMASR Act of 1958.

How many of the statements are accurate descriptions of the AMASR Act, 1958?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect provisions of the AMASR Act, 1958. The Act does grant the Central Government the power to declare national importance (1) and regulates excavations and artifact protection (2). Statement 3 is false; the text clarifies that "Missing Monuments" is a term used by the CAG, not a formal term in the Act. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NMA was established by a later amendment (2010), not the original 1958 Act.


5. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire:

1. The empire's zenith occurred during the Saluva dynasty's rule.
2. Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab.
3. The Amara-Nayakas were solely responsible for collecting taxes in their territories.
4. The Virupaksha Temple is a notable architectural marvel of the Vijayanagara Empire.

How many of the statements correctly describe aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: Krishnadevaraya's expansion included the acquisition of the Raichur doab. Statement 4 is also correct: The Virupaksha Temple is a significant example of Vijayanagara architecture. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Tuluva dynasty, not the Saluva dynasty, is associated with the empire's peak.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while Amara-Nayakas collected taxes, they shared revenue with the empire, retaining a portion for their own use and expenses. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


6. Consider the following regarding the Holkar Dynasty:

1. The Holkar Dynasty was not part of the Maratha Confederacy.
2.  Ahilyabai Holkar's rule saw the promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry.
3. Malhar Rao II played a crucial role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
4. Ahilyabai Holkar's social reforms included resisting practices like Sati.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of the Holkar Dynasty?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Ahilyabai Holkar is known for her promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry (2), Malhar Rao II's involvement in the Third Anglo-Maratha War is historically accurate (3), and Ahilyabai Holkar's social reforms included opposing practices like Sati (4). Statement 1 is incorrect; the Holkar Dynasty was indeed a part of the Maratha Confederacy.

1.  The Indus script has been completely deciphered.
2.  The civilization engaged in both internal and external trade.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Indus Valley Civilization had extensive trade networks (2), Lothal's dry dock is a significant archaeological find (3), and the depiction of Pasupati on seals is well-documented (4). Statement 1 is incorrect; the Indus script remains undeciphered.


8. Consider the following about the  Bavikonda Monastery:

1.  It is located near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.
2.  The monastery primarily represents Mahayana Buddhism.
3. It is a part of the 'Shalihundam-Thotlakonda-Bavikonda-Bojjanakonda-Amravati-Anupu' Buddhist Circuit.
4. The name "Bavikonda" signifies a hill with numerous wells.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Bavikonda Monastery?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Bavikonda's location near Visakhapatnam (1), its inclusion in the specified Buddhist Circuit (3), and the meaning of its name (4) are accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect; the text indicates that Bavikonda represents Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism.


9. Consider the following statements concerning  the Nalanda University:

1. The new Nalanda University campus is a "Net Zero Green Campus."
2.  The university was established based on a decision made at the first East Asia Summit.
3. The ancient Nalanda University's library was known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth."
4.  The ancient Nalanda University primarily focused on Vedic studies.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of Nalanda University (ancient or modern)?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The new campus's "Net Zero Green" status (1) is mentioned in the text. The description of the ancient university's library as "Dharma Gunj" (3) is accurate.  The ancient Nalanda's diverse curriculum included Vedic studies (4), although not exclusively. Statement 2 is incorrect; the decision to establish the modern university was made at the *second*, not the first, East Asia Summit.


10. Consider the following regarding the  Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative:

1. The initiative aims to train women and youth in tourism-related skills.
2.  The initiative is limited to ten tourist destinations across India.
3.  The initiative aims to elevate the overall tourist experience.
4. The initiative is primarily focused on developing new luxury tourism packages.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the aims and scope of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative?
(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The initiative emphasizes training for women and youth (1) and aims to enhance the tourist experience (3). Statement 2 is incorrect; the initiative covers 50, not 10, destinations. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while new tourism products are developed, the focus is not specifically on luxury packages.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.



1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Nalanda University:

1.  It was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE.
2.  Its library, "Dharma Gunj," held over nine million books.
3.  The university's curriculum included Theravada Buddhism but excluded Mahayana Buddhism.
4.  Admissions were based solely on merit, with exams conducted by trained gatekeepers.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Ancient Nalanda University?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate representations of the Ancient Nalanda University.  Kumargupta I is credited with its founding in the 5th century CE.  Its extensive library, "Dharma Gunj," is legendary for its vast collection of books.  The rigorous admissions process, based solely on merit and overseen by trained gatekeepers, is well-documented.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Nalanda University's curriculum encompassed a wide range of subjects, including both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, reflecting its inclusive approach to Buddhist scholarship and its diverse student body.  The exclusion of Mahayana Buddhism is a misrepresentation of its historical significance.


2. Consider the following features related to the legal framework for protecting monuments in India:

1.  Article 49 of the Indian Constitution mandates the protection of monuments of national importance.
2.  The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, regulates archaeological excavations.
3.  The AMASR Act includes a provision for declaring monuments as "missing" if they are untraceable.
4.  The National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established under the AMASR Act, 1958.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect aspects of the legal framework for the protection of monuments in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the legal framework. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and places of national importance. The AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal basis for the preservation of ancient and historical monuments and regulates archaeological excavations.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the AMASR Act does not define or use the term "missing monuments." This term originated later in CAG audit reports.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NMA was established under the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, not the original 1958 Act.  Therefore, only two statements correctly describe the legal framework.


3. Consider the following regarding the Nalanda University Act, 2010:

1.  It established Nalanda University as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue.
2.  The Act's foundation was laid by the 1st East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007.
3.  The new campus is designed as a "Net Zero Green Campus."
4.  The university is located near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Bihar.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of the Nalanda University Act, 2010, and its subsequent developments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Nalanda University Act, 2010, envisioned the university as a center for inter-civilizational dialogue.  The new campus is indeed designed to be a "Net Zero Green Campus." Finally, its location near the ancient Nalanda ruins in Bihar is a key feature. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The decision to establish Nalanda University was made at the *2nd* East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines in 2007, not the 1st.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


4. Consider the following regarding the Shree Jagannath Temple in Puri:

1.  It is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and his siblings.
2.  The Ratna Bhandar, its treasury, was reopened after 50 years.
3.  Its architecture is primarily in the Dravidian style.
4.  The temple's construction is attributed to Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The temple is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra.  Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, founder of the Ganga dynasty, is credited with its construction. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Ratna Bhandar was reopened after 46 years, not 50.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the temple's architecture follows the Kalinga style, a sub-style of Nagara, not the Dravidian style. Thus, only two statements are accurate.


5. Consider the following statements about the Vaikom Satyagraha:

1.  It resulted in the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.
2.  It led to the establishment of the Travancore State Congress.
3.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker fully supported Gandhi's approach during the Satyagraha.
4.  The movement focused on opening all four roads leading to the temple.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect outcomes or aspects of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. The Vaikom Satyagraha directly resulted in the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting lower-caste individuals access to temples.  Statement 2 is incorrect; it led to legal reforms and initiatives, but not the establishment of the Travancore State Congress. Statement 3 is false; Periyar disagreed with Gandhi's approach and later left the Congress. Statement 4 is also incorrect; only three of the four roads were opened as a result of the Satyagraha. Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the Vaikom Satyagraha's outcomes.


6. Consider the following figures associated with the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA):

1.  Ram Prasad Bismil
2.  Bhagat Singh
3.  Ashfaqullah Khan
4.  Thakur Roshan Singh

How many of the above individuals were directly involved in the Kakori Train Action?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh were key figures in the Kakori Train Action.  Bhagat Singh, while a prominent revolutionary, was not directly involved in this specific event. Therefore, only three of the listed individuals were directly involved.


7. Consider the following about the contributions of Swami Vivekananda:

1. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897.
2. His address at the World's Parliament of Religions was in 1894.
3. He primarily preached Advaita Vedanta philosophy.
4. He inspired Jamsetji Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect Swami Vivekananda's contributions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897.  He primarily propagated Advaita Vedanta philosophy. He also inspired Jamsetji Tata to establish the IISc. However, statement 2 is incorrect; his address at the World's Parliament of Religions was in 1893, not 1894. Therefore, three statements are accurate.


8. Consider the following regarding the Bharat Ratna Award:

1.  It is India's highest civilian award.
2.  Recipients receive a monetary grant along with the award.
3.  The Prime Minister makes recommendations for the award to the President.
4.  The award is granted for outstanding service in any field.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Bharat Ratna Award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award. The Prime Minister recommends recipients to the President, although no formal process is explicitly defined.  The award is given for outstanding contributions in any field. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the award does not include a monetary grant.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


9. Consider the following about megalithic burial sites in India:

1.  Dolmenoid cists are a type of chamber tomb.
2.  Megalithic peoples lived exclusively in settled agricultural communities.
3.  Three basic types of megaliths are recognized: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and those not connected to burials.
4.  Megalithic sites are primarily found in the Himalayan region.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of megalithic burial sites in India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of chamber tomb found in megalithic sites. The three types of megaliths mentioned are widely accepted classifications. However, statement 2 is incorrect; megalithic peoples exhibited both settled and semi-nomadic lifestyles. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while megalithic sites are found across India, their distribution is not limited to the Himalayas.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


10. Consider the following about the Phanigiri archaeological site in Telangana:

1.  It is located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad.
2.  Excavations have unearthed evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects.
3.  The site is primarily known for its significant Jain structures.
4.  It dates back to the Gupta period.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of the Phanigiri archaeological site?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Phanigiri is located about 110 km from Hyderabad and excavations reveal evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist practices. Statement 3 is incorrect; Phanigiri is a Buddhist site, not a Jain site. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the site dates back to the Ikshvaku period, not the Gupta period. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Kasturi Cotton Bharat:**

1. It is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Textiles and the Cotton Corporation of India.
2.  Blockchain technology is used for traceability of the cotton.
3. The aim is to enhance global competitiveness of Indian cotton through self-regulation.
4. TEXPROCIL is the implementing agency.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Kasturi Cotton Bharat is indeed a joint initiative involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.  Blockchain technology is a core component of the initiative, ensuring complete traceability and certification of the cotton from farm to consumer, enhancing its premium quality status. The program aims to establish self-regulation within the industry, taking complete ownership of branding, traceability, and certification to improve global competitiveness and build a sustainable ecosystem.  TEXPROCIL (Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council) serves as the implementing agency, driving the initiative forward.  All four statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat program.


**2. Consider the following regarding Project PARI:**

1. It is a Ministry of Culture initiative executed by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.
2. Its aim is to promote art through public installations in urban landscapes.
3. The project features only traditional Indian art forms like Thangka painting.
4.  The first intervention under the project is in Mumbai.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Project PARI is correctly identified as a Ministry of Culture initiative implemented by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Its primary goal is to democratize art through public installations, transforming urban spaces into accessible galleries. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the project does include traditional art forms like Thangka painting, it is not limited to them; it encompasses a wider range of artistic expressions from across India.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the first intervention is in Delhi, not Mumbai. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements about the ‘Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi’ initiative:**

1. It is a national responsible tourism initiative launched by the Ministry of Tourism.
2. It covers 100 tourist destinations across the country.
3. It aims to promote sustainable and responsible tourism practices.
4. The initiative is solely focused on promoting eco-tourism.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The ‘Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi’ initiative is accurately described as a national responsible tourism initiative launched by the Ministry of Tourism.  The initiative aims to promote responsible tourism, although the specific focus on sustainable practices is not explicitly mentioned in the source. However, statement 2 is incorrect; it covers 50, not 100, tourist destinations. Statement 4 is also incorrect as the initiative's scope is not limited to eco-tourism; it encompasses broader responsible tourism practices.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are definitively correct.


**4. Consider the following about Chola naval expeditions:**

1.  Rajaraja I’s naval forces destroyed the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I’s conquests extended to the Maldives but not Sri Lanka.
3. The Chola empire’s naval power played a significant role in their expansion.
4. Nagapattinam was a crucial trading center for the Chola empire.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Rajaraja I's successful naval campaigns against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai are well-documented, making statement 1 correct. The Chola empire's maritime dominance was instrumental in their territorial expansion, validating statement 3. Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading hub for the Cholas is also historically established, confirming statement 4.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; Rajendra I's naval conquests did include Sri Lanka, resulting in its annexation as a Chola province.  Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative:**

1. It is led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan.
2. Transhumance is the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.
3.  The initiative focuses solely on transhumance practices in Europe.
4.  Transhumance is not practiced in the Indian plains.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is correctly identified as being led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan (statement 1). The definition of transhumance as the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities is accurate (statement 2). However, statement 3 is false; while the initiative recognizes European transhumance traditions, its scope is not limited to Europe. Statement 4 is also false; transhumance practices exist in various Indian plains, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Therefore only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**6. Consider the following about UNESCO’s Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts are included.

4.  The MOW program maintains only a regional register.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscripts in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register is accurate (statement 1). The 1992 launch date of the MOW program is also correct (statement 2).  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the register focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, this does not exclude works from other areas.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the MOW program maintains international, regional, and national registers. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**7. Consider the following about Kozhikode (Calicut):**

1.  It is located on the Malabar coast.
2.  It was historically known as a major spice trading center.
3.  The term “calico” is believed to have originated from Calicut.
4.  It is the first city in India to be recognized as a ‘City of Literature’ by UNESCO.

How many of the above statements are correct?

**Explanation:** Kozhikode's location on the Malabar coast is geographically accurate (statement 1). Its historical significance as a major spice trading center is well-established (statement 2). The etymological connection between "calico" and Calicut is a widely accepted theory (statement 3). Finally, Kerala's celebration of Kozhikode's recognition as India's first UNESCO 'City of Literature' confirms statement 4. All four statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding Srinagar's designation as a World Craft City:**

1.  It is the fourth Indian city to receive this designation after Jaipur, Malappuram, and Mysore.
2.  The designation was granted by the World Crafts Council International (WCCI).
3.  Srinagar's local crafts include Pashmina shawls and walnut wood carving.
4.  The WCCI is not affiliated with UNESCO.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The sequence of Indian cities receiving the World Craft City designation – Jaipur, Malappuram, Mysore, and then Srinagar – is correctly stated (statement 1).

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four features represent a shift away from the traditional Western depiction of Lady Justice and towards a more Indian context. The saree replaces Western attire, symbolizing an embrace of Indian tradition.  Open eyes, instead of a blindfold, signify that justice is not blind but actively considers societal complexities and nuances. The replacement of the sword with the Indian Constitution highlights the supremacy of the Constitution in the Indian legal system and emphasizes justice rooted in constitutional values rather than mere punishment.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The AMASR Act, 1958, grants the power to the Central Government to delist monuments, and it explicitly includes the protection of sculptures and carvings. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not a defined term within the act itself. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established by a later amendment (AMASR Amendment and Validation Act, 2010), not by the original 1958 Act.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire. The Sangama Dynasty's founding is well-established historical fact. Krishnadevaraya's reign was indeed a high point, marked by territorial expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab.  The Amara-Nayaka system, a crucial element of the empire's decentralized administration, involved assigning territories to military commanders.  The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi stands as a prime example of the empire's architectural achievements. Each element contributes to a complete understanding of the empire's political structure, territorial extent, and cultural legacy.

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The MOW program does aim to preserve significant manuscripts, and the Ramcharitmanas was indeed included. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the register focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, it also includes works from other regions that have a significant impact on the Asia-Pacific region. Statement 4 is incorrect; the MOW program was launched in 1992, not 2002.  This question tests factual recall and requires careful evaluation of each statement's accuracy.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Transhumance indeed involves the seasonal movement of both livestock and herding communities.  It is prevalent in the Himalayas, where nomadic tribes like Gujars and Bakarwals practice it.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland is a recognized intangible cultural heritage, demonstrating the global recognition of this traditional practice. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while transhumance is strongly linked to nomadic communities, it's not exclusively practiced by them; it also exists in other regions with seasonal variations in pastureland. The question tests understanding of the concept and its geographic and social context while including a misleading statement to increase difficulty.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Kumargupta I's founding of Nalanda, the vast library, and Xuan Zang's studies under Shilabhadra are all well-documented aspects of Nalanda's history. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while Bakhtiyar Khalji is associated with Nalanda's destruction, the year is 1205 AD, not 1105 AD. This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between accurate and slightly inaccurate information, demanding precise knowledge. The slightly incorrect date acts as a strong distractor.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The Indus Valley Civilization's maritime connections with Mesopotamia are well-established. Shivaji's Maratha navy did indeed resist European powers. The NMHC's aim is to showcase India's maritime past. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the Cholas engaged in maritime trade, their reach extended significantly beyond the Middle East, encompassing Southeast Asia and other regions. This question tests the examinee's knowledge of different periods and aspects of India's maritime history, making it challenging due to the need for precise historical understanding.  The incorrect statement about the Cholas' trade partners acts as a significant distractor.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The discovery of Neolithic rock carvings in Goa and the unearthing of Ikshvaku period artifacts at Phanigiri are accurate.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built for Jain monks, not Buddhist monks. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Bavikonda Monastery is near Visakhapatnam, not Chennai. This question tests detailed knowledge of specific archaeological sites and their characteristics, demanding precise information and making it challenging due to the need for accurate recall of location and religious affiliations.  The incorrect statements about the caves' religious affiliation and Bavikonda's location serve as effective distractors.

(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The ICC did launch the T20 World Cup in 2007, and the 20-over format is a defining feature. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while India did win the 2024 T20 World Cup, they defeated South Africa, not Australia, in the final. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the ICC's headquarters are in Dubai, UAE, not London. This question tests knowledge of sports events and their governing bodies, requiring precise factual recall and making it challenging due to the inclusion of plausible but incorrect details about the winning team and the ICC's location.  The incorrect details about the final opponent and ICC headquarters are effective distractors.

4.  Dholavira is a UNESCO World Heritage site.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of the Dholavira site?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

All four statements are correct. Dholavira is indeed located in Gujarat, India; it is a significant Harappan site known for its advanced water management systems, including reservoirs and sophisticated drainage; it features a large, possibly ceremonial, assembly area; and it is a UNESCO World Heritage site. This question tests knowledge of a specific archaeological site and its features, requiring precise factual recall.  The inclusion of all correct statements makes the question challenging as it requires thorough knowledge of the site's characteristics.

1.  FIDE's motto is "Gens una Sumus."
2.  FIDE's headquarters are currently located in Paris, France.
3.  FIDE is the global governing body for chess.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE)?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. FIDE's motto is indeed "Gens una Sumus," meaning "We are one family"; it is the global governing body for chess; and it was founded in 1924. However, statement 2 is incorrect;  FIDE's headquarters are currently located in Lausanne, Switzerland, not Paris.  This question tests knowledge of a specific international organization, requiring precise factual recall, particularly about the location of its headquarters. The inclusion of an incorrect statement regarding headquarters increases the question's difficulty.


**1. Consider the following aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power:**

1.  Control over the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.
2.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
3.  Conquests in Sri Lanka and the Malay Peninsula.
4.  Nagapattinam's role as a key trading center.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the maritime strength and influence of the Chola Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Chola Empire's naval prowess was a cornerstone of its power and influence.  Their dominance of the Bay of Bengal, termed the "Chola Lake,"  facilitated extensive trade networks with Southeast Asia, enriching their economy and spreading their cultural influence.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai demonstrates their military capabilities at sea.  Their successful military expeditions to Sri Lanka, resulting in its annexation, and to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcase their ambitious expansionist policies enabled by their strong navy. Finally, Nagapattinam served as a vital trading hub, underscoring the empire's economic reliance on maritime trade.  All four statements accurately portray facets of the Chola Empire's maritime power.


**2. Consider the following features of transhumance:**

1.  Seasonal migration of livestock and human communities.
2.  Prevalence primarily in the Himalayan region of India.
3.  Recognition of two transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023.
4.  Exclusive practice by nomadic tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas.

How many of the above accurately describe the practice of transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Transhumance is indeed the seasonal movement of livestock and the human communities that tend them, making statement 1 correct. While it is prevalent in the Himalayas, involving tribes like Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas, it is also practiced in other plains regions of India, making statement 2 partially correct and statement 4 incorrect.  The UNESCO recognition of two transhumance traditions in 2023 highlights its global importance, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the practice of transhumance.


**3. Consider the following about the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty's establishment marked the empire's beginning.
2.  The Tuluva Dynasty oversaw the empire's territorial expansion to its greatest extent.
3.  The Aravidu Dynasty was characterized by internal strife and external threats.
4.  The empire's political structure relied entirely on a centralized, hereditary system.

How many of these statements correctly describe aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Vijayanagara Empire's history is marked by a succession of dynasties, starting with the Sangama Dynasty, making statement 1 correct. The Tuluva Dynasty is associated with the empire's peak in terms of territorial expansion under rulers like Krishnadevaraya, making statement 2 correct. The Aravidu Dynasty faced significant internal conflicts and external pressures, leading to the empire's eventual decline, making statement 3 correct.  However, statement 4 is inaccurate. While the empire had a centralized structure with the Raya as the supreme ruler, the Amara-Nayaka system delegated significant power to regional military commanders, who governed territories and collected taxes, creating a decentralized element within the overall structure.


**4. Consider the following about prehistoric rock paintings in India:**

1.  The earliest paintings are exclusively from the Upper Paleolithic period.
2.  Mesolithic paintings predominantly depict hunting scenes and community dances.
3.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic paintings maintain the same vividness as earlier periods.
4.  Bhimbetka and Jwalapuram are sites known for Upper Paleolithic paintings.

How many of these statements are accurate regarding the characteristics and locations of prehistoric Indian rock paintings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While the earliest *reported* paintings are from the Upper Paleolithic period,  it's not definitively stated that *all* earliest paintings are exclusively from this period; further discoveries might alter this.  Therefore statement 1 is partially correct, but not entirely.  Statement 2 is accurate; Mesolithic paintings frequently depict human activities like hunting and communal dances.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Neolithic-Chalcolithic paintings show a decline in the vibrancy and detail compared to earlier periods. Statement 4 is correct; Bhimbetka and Jwalapuram are well-known sites containing Upper Paleolithic rock art.  Thus, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following about the  UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The register includes manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2.  The 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, made the inclusion decision.
3.  The MOW Programme was launched in 1992 and maintains only a single international register.
4.  The register exclusively features South Asian literary works.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the UNESCO MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The register indeed includes the mentioned Indian literary works, and the decision for their inclusion was taken at the specified meeting.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the MOW Programme maintains three registers: international, regional, and national. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the register includes works from across the Asia-Pacific region, not solely from South Asia. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the register.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC):**

1.  Its aim is to showcase India's maritime heritage from ancient times to the present.
2.  Key projects include a lighthouse museum and coastal state pavilions.
3.  The NMHC's primary focus is on the post-independence period of Indian maritime history.
4.  The earliest evidence of Indian maritime activity is found in the Gupta Dynasty period.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NMHC and India's maritime heritage?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NMHC's stated aim is to showcase India's comprehensive maritime history, making statement 1 correct.  The inclusion of a lighthouse museum and coastal state pavilions is also accurate, supporting statement 2. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the NMHC encompasses the entirety of India's maritime past, not just the post-independence era.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the earliest references to maritime activities are found much earlier, in the Vedic Age and even before, in the Indus Valley Civilization.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding ancient Indian universities:**

1.  Vikramshila University was known for its association with Atisha Dipankara.
2.  Nalanda University was the oldest university in India.
3.  Odantapuri University was established in the 8th century by the Pala ruler Gopal I.
4.  Nagarjunakonda University was primarily associated with Mahayana Buddhism.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of ancient Indian universities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Atisha Dipankara's association with Vikramshila is well-documented, making statement 1 correct. Odantapuri's founding by Gopal I in the 8th century is also historically accurate, making statement 3 correct. Nagarjunakonda's connection to Mahayana Buddhism through Nagarjuna is also accurate, making statement 4 correct. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Nalanda was not the oldest; Taxila predates it.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following about the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri:**

1.  It is dedicated to Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra.
2.  Its Ratna Bhandar was reopened after 46 years.
3.  It was built during the reign of Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva.
4.  Its architectural style is exclusively Dravidian.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The temple's dedication to the holy trinity, the reopening of its treasury, and its construction during Chodaganga Deva's reign are all well-established facts. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the temple's architectural style is Kalinga, a sub-style within the Nagara style, not exclusively Dravidian.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Srikakulam region:**

1.  Its former name was Chicacole, used by the British.
2.  It was part of the Kalinga Dynasty and later the Gajapati Kingdom.
3.  It features significant Buddhist sites at Salihundam and Danthapuri.
4.  Its historical significance is limited to the medieval period.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the history and cultural sites of Srikakulam?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. Srikakulam's former name, its association with the Kalinga Dynasty and Gajapati Kingdom, and the presence of Buddhist sites at Salihundam and Danthapuri are all historically verifiable. However, statement 4 is incorrect; Srikakulam's history extends beyond the medieval period, encompassing earlier periods like the Kalinga Dynasty and later periods including the Vijayanagara Empire.  Therefore, three statements accurately reflect Srikakulam's historical and cultural aspects.


**10. Consider the following regarding the International Yoga Day:**

1.  The United Nations proclaimed June 21st as International Yoga Day.
2.  India proposed the draft resolution for International Yoga Day.
3.  The word "Yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to join."
4.  Yoga's origins are solely traceable to Patanjali's Yogasutra.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of International Yoga Day and Yoga's origins?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The UN's proclamation of June 21st as International Yoga Day, India's proposal of the resolution, and the Sanskrit etymology of "Yoga" are all correct.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; while Patanjali's Yogasutra is a significant text, Yoga's origins are much older and evidenced in earlier texts and archaeological findings, including the Indus Valley Civilization.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the task,  creating a large number of questions that are both difficult and avoid obvious answers while using only the provided text is challenging. The questions below attempt to meet these requirements to the best of my ability.  The explanations are detailed to provide thorough justification for the correct answer and discuss why other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Nalanda University:**

1. It was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE.
2.  Its library, "Dharma Gunj," held over nine million books across nine floors.
3.  Major disciplines taught included Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Vedic studies.
4. Admissions were based solely on merit, with exams conducted by trained gatekeepers.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the ancient Nalanda University?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.  Kumargupta I's founding of Nalanda University in the 5th century CE is a well-established historical fact. The university's curriculum encompassed a wide range of subjects, including the Buddhist schools of Theravada and Mahayana, as well as Vedic studies, reflecting its inclusive nature. The rigorous admission process, based on meritocratic examinations administered by trained personnel, highlights the institution's high academic standards.

Statement 2, however, is likely an exaggeration. While the library, "Dharma Gunj," or "Mountain of Truth," was renowned for its vast collection, the claim of nine million books across nine floors is not definitively supported by historical evidence and likely inflated.  The exact number of books remains debated among scholars.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the delisting of centrally protected monuments by the ASI:**

1.  The AMASR Act of 1958 provides the legal framework for delisting monuments deemed no longer of national importance.
2. The term "Missing Monuments" is officially used in the AMASR Act to categorize untraceable monuments.
3.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its delisting decisions on reports from the Ministry of Culture.
4. Delisting a monument removes its protection and allows for regular construction in the area.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the process of delisting centrally protected monuments in India.  The AMASR Act of 1958 grants the Central Government the power to delist monuments that have ceased to be of national importance.  The ASI relies on reports from the Ministry of Culture to inform its decisions regarding delisting.  Once delisted, a monument loses its protected status, and regular construction activities can proceed in the area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the term "Missing Monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act; it was introduced by the CAG Audit team in their report.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to the promotion of Indian art and culture:**

1.  Project PARI aims to democratize art through public installations in urban landscapes.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The implementing agency for Kasturi Cotton Bharat is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), not the Lalit Kala Akademi.  The Lalit Kala Akademi is involved in Project PARI.


**4. Consider the following about the awards and recognitions mentioned:**

1. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, and recommendations for it are formally made by a dedicated committee.

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed given annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals. The UNESCO Prix Versailles Award criteria match the description given.  Abhinav Bindra's receipt of the Olympic Order is mentioned in the text.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that while the Bharat Ratna is given by the President, there is no formal recommendation process; the Prime Minister makes the suggestion.

Statement 4 accurately reflects the initiative's aim – to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by improving its branding, traceability, and certification.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The implementing agency for Kasturi Cotton Bharat is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), not the Cotton Corporation of India.  The Cotton Corporation of India is involved, but it's not the sole implementing agency.

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly describes Project PARI's objective: to democratize art by creating public art installations in urban spaces. Statement 3 is also accurate; Thangka painting from Sikkim/Ladakh is explicitly mentioned as one of the art forms included. However, Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lalit Kala Akademi is the executing body, National Gallery of Modern Art is also involved, but it's not the sole executing agency.  Statement 4 is also false; the text clearly states that Project PARI's first intervention took place in Delhi, not Mumbai.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi initiative is indeed a national responsible tourism initiative.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the initiative covers 50, not 100, tourist destinations. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Ministry of Tourism, not the Ministry of Culture, launched this initiative.  Statement 4 is factually incorrect as the initiative is a national one and not geographically limited to North India.

(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The new corridor projects for the Vishnupad and Mahabodhi Temples are explicitly inspired by the successful Kashi Vishwanath Corridor.  Statement 4 is also correct; the Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Bodh Gaya is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.  However, statement 1 is incorrect.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The NMHC at Lothal is indeed being developed under the Sagarmala Programme, and Lothal's historical significance includes its ancient man-made dry dock, a testament to India's maritime past.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NMHC is being developed in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, not solely by the Government of India. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Lothal is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambat, not on the Ganges.

(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, a significant legal reform granting access to temples for lower castes, was indeed a direct consequence of the Vaikom Satyagraha.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Satyagraha only resulted in the opening of three out of four roads leading to the temple. Statement 3 is also incorrect because Gandhiji and Periyar had differing interpretations of the movement's nature and objectives.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Satyagraha addressed caste inequalities, its primary focus was on access to the temple, not achieving broader political rights.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements touch upon Indian history, culture, or international collaborations related to cultural preservation. Rajaraja Chola's naval expeditions are a part of Indian history. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative, while international, acknowledges the significance of transhumance practices in India and elsewhere. UNESCO's MOW program directly relates to cultural preservation, and the International Yoga Day is a celebration of Indian culture and its global reach.

All five initiatives are directly overseen or launched by different Ministries of the Indian government.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat is under the Ministry of Textiles. Project PARI falls under the Ministry of Culture.  The Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi initiative is overseen by the Ministry of Tourism.  The renaming of Mumbai Central station, if it happens, would be a Ministry of Railways initiative.  Finally, the Samagra Shiksha scheme is under the Department of School Education and Literacy, which is part of a larger government structure. Therefore, all five are directly linked to specific government ministries.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate representations of facets of India's rich maritime history.  The Indus Valley Civilization's extensive trade network included Mesopotamia, evidenced by archaeological findings and textual references.  The Magadha kingdom's navy, though its exact scale and capabilities remain debated among historians, represents an early instance of organized naval power in ancient India. The Cholas' naval prowess and extensive maritime trade with Southeast Asia are well-documented, significantly impacting cultural exchange. Kanhoji Angre's role in revitalizing the Maratha navy and reclaiming territories from the Siddis is a crucial episode in Maratha maritime history.  These facts highlight the long and varied history of maritime activity in India, demonstrating its importance in trade, diplomacy, and military power throughout different periods.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the NMHC at Lothal.  The NMHC is indeed a project under the Sagarmala Programme, a government initiative to improve India's port infrastructure and maritime sector.  Lothal's significance as a city of the Indus Valley Civilization and its possession of the oldest known man-made dry dock are well-established facts, making statement 2 correct.  The NMHC's stated aim is to showcase India's maritime history across various eras, aligning with statement 3. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while the NMHC will feature coastal state pavilions, there is no specific mention of a pavilion solely dedicated to Gujarat's shipbuilding history in available information. The focus is broader, encompassing India's overall maritime heritage.


**3. Consider the following about the Chola Empire's naval power:**

1.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I were key figures in expanding Chola naval dominance.
2.  The Chola navy controlled the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade with Southeast Asia.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval capabilities and influence?

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I were instrumental in expanding the empire's maritime reach and influence. The Chola navy's control over the Bay of Bengal facilitated extensive trade with Southeast Asia, contributing significantly to the empire's economic prosperity. Nagapattinam functioned as a major port and trading hub during this period. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Chola navy certainly played a defensive role, its primary focus was not solely on coastal defense.  The Chola navy actively engaged in offensive expeditions, expanding the empire's territory and influence through naval conquests in Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia.  This demonstrates a more assertive and expansionist naval strategy than purely defensive posture.


**4. Consider the following figures associated with the Maratha Empire:**

1.  Shivaji Maharaj, known for building coastal forts like Vijaydurg and Sindhudurg.
2.  Kanhoji Angre, who served as the Sarkhel of the Maratha navy.
3.  Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, known for his military strategies and administrative reforms.
4.  Bajirao I, famed for his cavalry tactics and military victories.


How many of the above individuals played significant roles in the Maratha Empire's military and naval history?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four individuals listed played significant roles in the Maratha Empire’s military and naval history. Shivaji Maharaj's establishment of coastal forts like Vijaydurg and Sindhudurg was crucial for controlling maritime trade routes and defending the coastline.  Kanhoji Angre's leadership of the Maratha navy is well-known. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, while less focused on naval matters than his father, continued the military expansion of the Maratha Empire, employing effective military strategies. Bajirao I's legendary cavalry tactics and military victories greatly expanded the Maratha Empire's territorial control on land, but his influence extended to overall military strength and strategy. Each individual's contributions, while distinct in their focus and approach, collectively shaped the military and naval landscape of the Maratha Empire.


**5. Consider the following related to Lothal's archaeological significance:**

1. Lothal was a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization.
2.  A man-made dry dock dating back to approximately 2400 BC was discovered at Lothal.
3.  Lothal's strategic location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers facilitated its trade.
4.  Evidence suggests Lothal engaged in extensive maritime trade with Mesopotamia.


How many of the statements correctly identify aspects of Lothal's historical importance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect Lothal's historical importance.  Lothal's status as a major Indus Valley Civilization city is well-established. The discovery of a man-made dry dock attests to its advanced maritime technology and knowledge of shipbuilding. Its location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambhat provided easy access to the sea, facilitating trade.  However, while Lothal engaged in extensive maritime trade, direct evidence of trade specifically with Mesopotamia is less definitive than the other points.  The Indus Valley Civilization traded widely, but the specific extent of its direct trade with Mesopotamia requires further archaeological corroboration, making statement 4 less certain than the others.  The other three statements are strongly supported by archaeological findings.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on sports and related events.  The questions are designed to be challenging and test factual recall, analysis, and understanding of interconnected concepts.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's performance in the Olympic Games:**

The text explicitly states that India's performance in the 2022 Commonwealth Games contrasted with its relatively weaker showing in Paris 2024, supporting statement 4.  The other options present misleading combinations of true and false statements, testing the candidate's ability to identify the single accurate assertion.


**2. Consider the following features of the Olympic Games:**

(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct.  India's Olympic ranking fell from 48th in Tokyo to 71st in Paris, contradicting statement 1. India won fewer medals in Paris (six) compared to Tokyo (seven), making statement 2 incorrect.  Paris was India's third-best Olympic performance, not the best, refuting statement 3. The inclusion of breaking, sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing in the Paris Olympics is accurately reflected in statement 4.  The other statements present incorrect information about India's Olympic performance, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in evaluating such claims.  Understanding the nuances of Olympic rankings and medal counts is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of India's sporting achievements on the global stage.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The first Commonwealth Games were indeed held in Hamilton, Canada, in 1930.

The 2026 CWG in Glasgow will feature *fewer* sports than the 2022 edition, specifically reducing the number from 12 to 10 disciplines. This reduction highlights the evolving nature of the CWG and the decisions made by the organizing committee regarding the inclusion of sports.  The question tests knowledge of both established facts about the CWG and the more recent changes to its format, demanding a thorough understanding of the Games' history and current status.


**3. Consider the following initiatives to promote the sports ecosystem in India:**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Khelo India, TOPS, and the One School-One Sport policy all directly contribute to athlete identification and development. Khelo India focuses on grassroots and elite levels. TOPS provides targeted support to elite athletes. The One School-One Sport policy, implemented in Sainik Schools, aims to nurture sporting talent at a young age.

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Mahatma Gandhi's early experiences with racial discrimination laid the groundwork for his future activism. The AAM involved both internal campaigns to challenge the apartheid regime and external efforts to apply international pressure, including sanctions.  Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo played a significant role in the movement. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UN played a crucial role in condemning apartheid and imposing sanctions. This question tests knowledge of the AAM, requiring an understanding of its key figures, strategies, and the international context within which it operated.

Statement 3 is incorrect; the National Film Awards are given across categories, including feature films, non-feature films, and best writing in cinema. This question tests the knowledge of the Indian film industry's awards system, requiring recall of the historical name, administrative body, and the range of awards presented.  The inclusion of an incorrect statement about award categories adds to the question's difficulty.

This question tests knowledge of a specific architectural project and its recognition, requiring recall of the museum's status, the award it received, and the award's general characteristics. The inclusion of a factually incorrect statement about the award's scope increases the challenge.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions corridor projects planned for the Vishnupad Temple and the Mahabodhi Temple.  The Kashi Vishwanath Temple corridor is mentioned as inspiration for these projects, not as a project itself in the context of the given text. The Amar Kalpavriksha tree, while significant to Jyotirmath, is not directly linked to a pilgrimage corridor project in the provided information. Therefore, only three of the listed items are directly associated with the mentioned pilgrimage corridor projects.

The Chola navy's control of the Bay of Bengal, often referred to as the "Chola Lake," enabled extensive trade with Southeast Asia, solidifying their economic and political influence. Nagapattinam's status as a major trading hub highlights the economic benefits derived from their naval dominance.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the Chola navy's influence extended to sea trade and control of sea routes, not primarily inland waterways. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).

Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the initiative and transhumance itself necessitates acknowledging all the provided statements.

This event coincides with the end of the first Rainy Retreat (Vassa) and the Pavāraņā festival, significant events in the Buddhist calendar. The Ministry of Culture, in association with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), actively participates in observing IAD. Statement 4 is incorrect; while IAD has strong religious roots, its observance also often involves cultural and historical elements related to Buddhism's propagation and influence. The event transcends a purely religious context to encompass broader cultural appreciation.

Statement 4 is incorrect; the Bhumisparsha Mudra, not the Abhaya Mudra, is associated with calling the earth to witness and is often depicted in the context of Buddha's enlightenment.  The Abhaya Mudra's significance lies in its visual representation of reassurance, security, and the overcoming of fear, central tenets within Buddhist philosophy.

The Act's purpose of preserving monuments, the Central Government's power to declare national importance, the regulation of excavations, and the protection of associated artifacts are all accurate. However, the statement about the formal definition of "Missing Monuments" within the Act is incorrect; this term is not officially used in the Act itself.

1. Kasturi Cotton Bharat aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Padma Vibhushan
2.  Bharat Ratna
3.  Anubhav Awards
4.  Dadasaheb Phalke Award

How many of the above are among the highest civilian awards in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Padma Awards (Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri) are among the highest civilian awards in India, conferred annually on Republic Day.  The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest award in the field of cinema, a specific domain. The Anubhav Awards, given by the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, recognize the contributions of retiring central government employees but are not considered among the highest civilian honors of the nation in the same league as the Bharat Ratna or Padma Awards. Therefore, only Padma Vibhushan, Bharat Ratna, and Dadasaheb Phalke Award are among the highest civilian awards in India in different categories.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Established in 1954
2.  Awarded posthumously in exceptional cases
3.  Consist of three categories
4.  Given for distinguished service in various fields

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Padma Awards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe the Padma Awards. They were instituted in 1954, are given in three categories (Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri), acknowledge distinguished service across various disciplines, and while not typically awarded posthumously, exceptions are made in highly deserving cases.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Awarded by the President of India
2.  Recommendations are made by the Prime Minister
3.  Does not include any monetary grant
4.  Open to both Indians and non-Indians

How many of the above are true of the Bharat Ratna?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect the Bharat Ratna.  It is awarded by the President of India based on recommendations from the Prime Minister (though no formal recommendations are strictly necessary).  The award doesn't come with a monetary grant.  Significantly, the Bharat Ratna is also open to non-Indians, as evidenced by past recipients like Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela.  Hence, all four statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Order of precedence includes Param Vir Chakra
2.  Announced twice a year
3.  Peacetime Gallantry Awards were instituted in 1952
4.  Includes Ashoka Chakra


How many of the above statements correctly describe Gallantry Awards in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the four statements are correct. The order of precedence for gallantry awards indeed includes the Param Vir Chakra, and these awards are announced twice yearly (on Republic Day and Independence Day).  The Ashoka Chakra is also a Gallantry Award. However, the statement that Peacetime Gallantry Awards were instituted in 1952 is incorrect. While some Gallantry awards were instituted in 1950 and others in 1952, the categorization and renaming of these awards to their current designations happened later, specifically the renaming of Ashoka Chakra classes in 1967.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Awarded for lifetime achievement in cinema

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate descriptions of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. It is given as a lifetime achievement award in Indian cinema, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, instituted in 1969 to mark Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary, and includes a cash prize (currently ₹10 lakhs) along with a Golden Lotus medallion and shawl.


**6. Consider the following statements about the National Film Awards:**

1.  Initially called State Awards
2.  Administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals since 1973

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the National Film Awards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the four statements are correct. The National Film Awards were initially called State Awards, are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals since 1973, and include the "Most Film Friendly State" award.  However, the statement that awards are given *only* for Feature Films is incorrect. The awards are also given in the categories of Non-Feature Films and Best Writing in Cinema.

1.  Kasturi Cotton is a premium quality Indian cotton.
2.  Utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.
3.  Implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Kasturi Cotton Bharat?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements are correct. Kasturi Cotton is indeed a premium quality Indian cotton,  it utilizes blockchain technology for traceability, and it aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton. The incorrect statement is that it's implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture. The implementing agency is actually the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), and the initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.

1.  Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) Programme

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three out of the four initiatives are directly aimed at identifying and developing athletes. The Khelo India Rising Talent Identification (KIRTI) Programme focuses on school children.  The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provides comprehensive support to India's top athletes. The National Sports Development Fund Scheme also supports athletes with medal prospects.  The "One School – One Sport" policy, while promoting sports, is primarily focused on specializing in one sport within a particular school rather than on broad talent identification and development across the country.


**9. Consider the following related to the Ancient Nalanda University:**

1.  Founded by Kumargupta I
2.  Remained a center of learning until the 13th century CE

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

Three statements are accurate. Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE,  it included stupas and shrines in its architecture, and it possessed a renowned library called "Dharma Gunj" ("Mountain of Truth"). The statement that it remained a center of learning until the 13th century CE is incorrect; its active period ended in the 12th century CE.

**Explanation:**

Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims to be high, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  It was a part of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside the Bhonsle of Nagpur and the Gaekwad of Baroda.
2.  Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War led to the Treaty of Mandsaur.
3.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's rule significantly boosted the Maheswari weaving industry, a craft now registered under Geographical Indications (GI).
4.  The Holkar dynasty's economic policies centered around the development of Surat as a major trading hub.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of the Holkar Dynasty's history and economic impact.  The Maratha Confederacy comprised several prominent dynasties, including the Holkars, Bhonsles, Gaekwads, and Sindhias. Malhar Rao II's defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War indeed resulted in the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly impacting the Holkar's relationship with the British. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw Maheshwar and Indore become significant centers of trade, with a notable focus on the Maheswari weaving industry, which today holds GI status.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the text doesn't mention Surat's development as a central focus of Holkar economic policies.  Maheshwar and Indore were the key commercial centers during this period.


**2. Consider the following contributions of Nana Jagannath Shankarseth:**

1.  He played a crucial role in planning the infrastructure of Bombay, including buildings, streets, and avenues.
2.  He donated land for the establishment of schools, particularly emphasizing girls' education.
3.  He was instrumental in the construction of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station.
4.  He served as the first Indian Governor of the Bombay Presidency.

How many of the above accurately describe Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly highlight Shankarseth's contributions. He was indeed involved in urban planning for Bombay and a strong advocate for girls' education, donating family land for schools.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the text doesn't attribute the construction of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to him. While he was involved in railway projects, it wasn't this specific landmark. Statement 4 is also false; he was the first Indian nominated to the Legislative Council of Bombay, not the Governor.


**3. Consider the following aspects of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign:**

1.  She significantly promoted women's education and widow remarriage.
2.  She actively resisted social evils such as Sati and untouchability.
3.  She patronized the renowned Sanskrit scholar, Kalidasa.
4.  She established a new system of land revenue collection based on modern economic principles.

Which of the above accurately reflect aspects of her rule?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was a progressive ruler who championed women's education and widow remarriage, actively working against regressive social practices like Sati and untouchability.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while she patronized arts and scholars, Kalidasa was not among them. The text mentions Moropant and Shahir Anantaphandi. Statement 4 is also inaccurate; the text doesn't detail a new land revenue system based on modern principles under her rule.  Her economic policies focused more on trade and commerce.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Swami Dayanand Saraswati:**

1.  He authored "Satyartha Prakash," a significant work emphasizing a return to Vedic principles.
2.  He founded the Ramakrishna Mission, dedicated to social service and education.
3.  He advocated for the abolition of the caste system and actively fought against untouchability.
4.  He was a staunch supporter of the British Raj and its policies in India.

How many of the above statements are correct representations of Swami Dayanand Saraswati's views and actions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote "Satyartha Prakash," a key text promoting a return to Vedic ideals. He strongly opposed the caste system and untouchability, advocating for social reform.  Statement 2 is incorrect; he established the Arya Samaj, not the Ramakrishna Mission. The Ramakrishna Mission was founded by Swami Vivekananda.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; he was critical of the British Raj.


**5. Consider the following individuals associated with the anti-apartheid movement:**

1. Nelson Mandela
2. Mahatma Gandhi
3. Jawaharlal Nehru
4. Desmond Tutu

How many of the above played significant roles in opposing the apartheid regime in South Africa, either directly or through influential support?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four individuals played significant roles in opposing apartheid. Nelson Mandela was a central figure in the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance deeply influenced Mandela and the movement. Jawaharlal Nehru, as India's Prime Minister, provided strong diplomatic and moral support to the anti-apartheid movement. Desmond Tutu, a prominent South African anti-apartheid activist and religious leader, played a crucial role in advocating for social justice and an end to the apartheid regime.  Therefore, all four are correctly linked to the anti-apartheid movement.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty is inherently subjective and the "difficult" classification is based on the need for precise factual recall and the inclusion of plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1.  She was born in the village of Chondi, Ahmednagar.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate about Devi Ahilyabai Holkar?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's life and contributions.  Her birthplace, her father-in-law's position, her patronage of scholars, and her economic contributions through the development of Maheshwar and the Maheswari weaving industry are all well-documented historical facts. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements.


**2. Consider the following personalities and their contributions:**

1.  Bhagwan Mahaveer:  Known for his teachings on non-violence and the pursuit of spiritual liberation.
2.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth:  A philanthropist who significantly contributed to the development of Mumbai's infrastructure and education.

Which of the above personalities are primarily associated with significant philanthropic endeavors, contributing substantially to social welfare or societal development?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While Bhagwan Mahaveer's teachings indirectly promote social harmony through non-violence, his primary contribution is philosophical and religious. Ratan Tata's contributions, while immense, are primarily within the business and industrial sectors, with philanthropy being a significant but secondary aspect of his legacy.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth and Swami Vivekananda, however, are directly and prominently known for their substantial philanthropic works. Shankarseth's contributions to Mumbai's infrastructure and education are well documented, and Vivekananda's establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission is a testament to his commitment to social service.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty was succeeded by the Tuluva dynasty, during which the empire reached its zenith.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw significant territorial expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab and the subjugation of Orissa.
3.  The empire's administrative structure included the Amara-Nayakas, military commanders who governed territories and collected taxes.
4.  The Vijayanagara Empire's architectural marvels include the Virupaksha Temple and the Vithala Temple Complex, both located in Hampi.

Which of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate depictions of various aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire.

No statement contains inaccuracies or misleading information.


**4. Consider the following initiatives of the Indian government:**

4.  The renaming of Ravenshaw University, previously named after an administrator believed to be responsible for the 1866 Odisha famine.

Which of the above initiatives are primarily aimed at promoting economic development or enhancing cultural heritage?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Kasturi Cotton Bharat directly aims to boost the cotton industry's economic competitiveness. Project PARI enhances cultural heritage through public art. Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi promote responsible tourism, indirectly bolstering the economy while preserving the environment and cultural sites.  The renaming of Ravenshaw University, while symbolically important, is not a direct economic or cultural promotion initiative in itself; it's a rectification of a historical issue.


**5. Consider the following statements related to anti-caste movements in India:**

1.  The Satyashodhak Samaj, founded by Jyotirao Phule, aimed at the emancipation of lower castes and widows.
2.  The Justice Party Movement fought against Brahminic control in various sectors of society.
3.  The Self-Respect Movement, led by E.V. Ramaswami Naicker (Periyar), advocated against the caste system and Brahminical bias.
4.  The Vaikom Satyagraha, although partially successful, led to a rift between Mahatma Gandhi and Periyar due to differing perspectives on the movement's goals.

How many of the above statements correctly identify key features or outcomes of significant anti-caste movements in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Each statement accurately reflects the goals, leaders, or outcomes of notable anti-caste movements. The Satyashodhak Samaj's focus on lower-caste emancipation and widows' rights, the Justice Party's opposition to Brahminic dominance, Periyar's Self-Respect Movement's anti-caste stance, and the Vaikom Satyagraha's impact on the relationship between Gandhi and Periyar are all documented historical facts.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading details within these statements.

4.  The agreement restricts the corridor's use to Sikh pilgrims only.


How many of the above statements are INCORRECT?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial agreement for the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor was valid for 5 years, not 10.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  Pakistani Sikhs require an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak, unlike Indian Sikhs who can visit Kartarpur Sahib visa-free. Statement 3 is correct; the agreement stipulated same-day return for Indian pilgrims. Statement 4 is incorrect. The agreement explicitly states that there is no restriction on the faith of pilgrims using the corridor. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.

1.  Emphasis on the renunciation of material possessions.
2.  Advocacy for a strict caste-based social hierarchy.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Guru Nanak's teachings emphasized religious tolerance (3), rejecting discrimination based on caste or creed, and the importance of "seva" (4), or selfless service to others.  Options 1 and 2 contradict his teachings.  He didn't advocate for the renunciation of all material possessions, but rather for honest living and sharing wealth.  He strongly opposed the caste system.


**3. Consider the following locations associated with significant Sikh pilgrimage sites:**

1.  Sultanpur Lodhi, Punjab

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Arya Samaj, founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati, actively promoted a return to Vedic principles (2), rejecting idol worship and ritualistic excesses (1).  A defining characteristic was its attempt to reform Hinduism through proselytization (3), aiming to bring others into its fold.  The movement also established many educational institutions (4), including the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (DAV) schools.

**Explanation:**

Malhar Rao Holkar II was a ruler of the Holkar Dynasty, directly involved in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was a prominent queen who ruled Malwa after her husband's death and strengthened the dynasty. Tukoji Rao Holkar served as a commander in Ahilyabai's army.  While Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was a significant figure in Mumbai's development, he wasn't directly associated with the Holkar Dynasty's governance.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics, history, and Indian culture.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the economic contributions of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1. She established Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh as the seat of the Holkar dynasty, significantly impacting regional administration.
2.  She promoted the Maheswari weaving industry, contributing to the economic prosperity of the region.
3. Her patronage of arts and learning indirectly stimulated economic activity through increased demand for goods and services.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic contributions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic impact. Establishing Maheshwar as a center of the Holkar dynasty fostered economic growth through administrative stability and centralized trade.  Her promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry is a direct example of economic development. Patronage of arts and learning, while not directly economic, stimulates related industries and creates a conducive environment for economic activity. Statement 4 is incorrect; there's no evidence suggesting direct intervention in agricultural practices as a major economic initiative.  The focus was more on infrastructure and trade.


**2. Consider the following aspects of the Ahom Dynasty's administration:**

1. The Ahom kings held absolute power, unchecked by any council or ministerial body.
2.  The Patra Mantris played a significant role in the appointment of kings, limiting the monarch's authority.
3.  The Ahom administration was characterized by a highly centralized system with minimal regional autonomy.
4.  Periods of interregnum (absence of a king) occurred due to a lack of suitable candidates, highlighting the importance of succession.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Ahom Dynasty's administrative system?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate.  The Patra Mantris' role in king selection demonstrates a check on absolute monarchical power. The occurrence of interregnums further underscores the system's reliance on a suitable successor, rather than a purely hereditary system.  Statement 1 is incorrect as the Ahom kings did not hold absolute power; the Patra Mantris held considerable influence. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while centralized, the Ahom system did allow for some regional autonomy and variations in local governance.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Arya Samaj's principles and impact:**

1.  The Arya Samaj advocated for the strict adherence to traditional Hindu practices, rejecting any reformist ideas.
2.  Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder, emphasized the importance of Vedic learning and a return to original Hindu scriptures.

4.  The Arya Samaj's emphasis on proselytization led to a significant increase in the number of Hindu converts.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Arya Samaj's principles and impact?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. Swami Dayanand Saraswati's focus on Vedic learning and a return to original scriptures is a cornerstone of Arya Samaj ideology.  The Arya Samaj actively promoted women's education and challenged traditional social hierarchies.  Their emphasis on proselytization, though not as successful as some other movements, was a notable aspect of their approach. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Arya Samaj was a reformist movement, advocating for changes within Hinduism.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the Sangam Age?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are accurate. Sangam literature provides valuable insights into Tamil society, politics, and culture. While the first and third Sangams were in Madurai, the second was in Kapadapuram, demonstrating that the statement about different locations is correct.  Statement 1 is partially correct, as the social classification of Varna was known, but the Sangam literature's focus wasn't solely on the caste system. Statement 2 is incorrect; Avvaiyar, Nachchellaiyar, and Kakkaipadiniyar were notable *female* poets.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Odisha Famine of 1866:**

1. The famine was solely caused by natural calamities, with no role played by administrative failures.

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Puri Canal's construction was a post-famine initiative. Ravenshaw, despite being associated with the famine's governance, did initiate educational reforms.  The "Na-Anka Famine" designation is also accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; administrative failures contributed significantly to the famine's severity alongside natural calamities.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor:**

1. The agreement establishing the corridor permits visa-free travel for all Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India.
2.  The corridor is primarily a religious pilgrimage route, with no broader cultural or historical significance.

Which of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The agreement stipulates same-day return for Indian pilgrims, and Pakistan does levy a fee.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Pakistani Sikhs still require an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak. Statement 2 is incorrect; the corridor holds both religious and cultural-historical significance.


**8. Consider the following about the personalities associated with the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  Gandhiji fully supported Periyar's approach and tactics during the Vaikom Satyagraha.
2.  The Vaikom Satyagraha led to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct.  The Vaikom Satyagraha directly resulted in the Temple Entry Proclamation, and Periyar's dissatisfaction with the limited success led to his departure from the Congress.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Gandhiji and Periyar had differing perspectives on the movement's goals and approach. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Vaikom Satyagraha primarily focused on social reform, particularly temple entry for lower castes, not economic reforms.

Statement 3 is incorrect; the battle resulted in the deaths of all 21 Sikh soldiers, despite their heroic defense. Statement 4 is incorrect; they received the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The use of standardized weights and measures in internal and external trade.
2.  Evidence of a sophisticated dockyard system at Lothal.
3.  The presence of terracotta figurines depicting a Mother Goddess.
4.  The existence of a pictographic script, yet to be deciphered.
5.  The discovery of bearded male figures interpreted as priests.

How many of the above features accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization's economic, technological, religious, or cultural practices?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Statement 1 highlights their advanced trade practices facilitated by standardized weights and measures, indicating a developed economic system. Statement 2 points to the sophisticated engineering and maritime capabilities demonstrated by the Lothal dockyard. Statement 3 reflects the religious beliefs and practices of the civilization, as evidenced by the widespread presence of Mother Goddess figurines. Statement 4 underscores the unique writing system of the Indus Valley Civilization, whose undeciphered nature remains a subject of ongoing research.  Statement 5 adds to the understanding of their religious practices and social hierarchy through the interpretation of the bearded male figures as priests.  Therefore, all five statements are correct, making (d) the correct option.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:**

1.  It mandates the protection of monuments and places of national importance.
2.  It allows for the delisting of monuments deemed no longer of national importance.
3.  It exclusively governs the regulation of archaeological excavations.
4.  It provides a mechanism for the conservation and maintenance of protected monuments.
5.  It defines the term "Missing Monuments."

How many of the above statements correctly describe provisions or functions of the AMASR Act, 1958?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the AMASR Act, 1958.  The Act does indeed mandate the protection of nationally important monuments (1). It also includes a provision for delisting monuments that are no longer considered nationally significant (2), a process recently highlighted by the delisting of several "untraceable" monuments.  The Act also provides a framework for the conservation and maintenance of these protected sites (4). However, statement 3 is inaccurate as the Act's scope extends beyond just the regulation of excavations to encompass the broader protection and preservation of archaeological sites and remains.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined within the Act itself. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) accurately reflect the Act's provisions, making (c) the correct option.


**3. Consider the following about the Chola Dynasty's maritime activities:**

1.  Nagapattinam served as a key trading center.
2.  Their naval expeditions extended to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
3.  They engaged in extensive trade with Southeast Asia, spreading Indian culture.
4.  They controlled pearl farming as a significant economic activity.
5.  Rajaraja I's naval forces decisively defeated the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.

How many of these statements accurately describe the Chola Dynasty's maritime influence and activities?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four out of the five statements accurately reflect the Chola Dynasty's significant maritime activities. Nagapattinam's role as a major trading port (1) is well-documented.  Their naval power extended to conquests in Sri Lanka and the Maldives (2), demonstrating their reach and military strength.  Their maritime trade with Southeast Asia, and the cultural exchange it facilitated (3), is a significant aspect of their legacy.  The Cholas also controlled pearl farming (4), which contributed to their economic prosperity. However, statement 5, while containing elements of truth (Rajaraja I was a powerful naval commander), is potentially misleading as it lacks the necessary specific historical verification to be definitively correct. The specific battle at Kandalursalai and the extent of Chera navy defeat requires further historical corroboration to be considered as an undisputed fact.  Thus, four statements accurately describe the Chola Dynasty's maritime activities, making (b) the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following initiatives of the Indian government:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat, a program focused on enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.
2.  Project PARI, an initiative aimed at promoting public art installations across India.
3.  Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi, programs designed to enhance the tourist experience in India.
4.  The development of the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal.

How many of these initiatives are directly related to promoting and preserving India's cultural heritage, either tangible or intangible?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Three of the listed initiatives are directly linked to promoting and preserving India's cultural heritage. Project PARI (2) directly supports the promotion and presentation of Indian art through public installations. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiatives (3) aim to enhance the tourist experience by utilizing local people as cultural ambassadors, thereby promoting India's intangible cultural heritage. The NMHC at Lothal (4) focuses on showcasing India's maritime heritage, a significant aspect of its tangible cultural history.  However, Kasturi Cotton Bharat (1), while important for the Indian economy, is primarily focused on improving the competitiveness of the cotton industry and doesn't directly deal with cultural heritage preservation in the same way as the other three. Therefore, three initiatives are directly related to cultural heritage promotion and preservation, making (c) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following related to the Nalanda University:**

1.  Its establishment in the 5th century CE under the patronage of Kumargupta I.
2.  Its recognition as a significant center of learning until the 12th century CE.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of Nalanda University, both ancient and modern?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect aspects of Nalanda University.  Statement 1 correctly identifies its founding under Kumargupta I in the 5th century. Statement 2 accurately reflects its long history as a prominent center of learning until the 12th century. Statement 3 correctly highlights the diverse range of subjects taught at Nalanda, encompassing religious studies, arts, and other disciplines.

4.  M.S. Swaminathan, also a recipient of the Bharat Ratna.

How many of the above individuals received India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two of the individuals listed received the Bharat Ratna. P.V. Narasimha Rao (3) and M.S. Swaminathan (4) are both recipients of this prestigious award.  Swami Vivekananda (1) and Ratan Tata (2), while making significant contributions in their respective fields, are not listed as recipients of the Bharat Ratna. Therefore, only two of the mentioned individuals received the Bharat Ratna, making (b) the correct answer.  The question tests factual recall regarding recipients of the Bharat Ratna, creating difficulty through plausible distractors.

4.  Neolithic age rock carvings discovered in Goa's Mauxi village.
5.  Dolmenoid cists, a type of megalithic burial structure.

How many of these archaeological findings relate to pre-historic or early historic periods in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five archaeological findings are associated with pre-historic or early historic periods in India. The stone statues and terracotta figurines (1, 2) are from the Indus Valley Civilization, a pre-historic culture.  The coin hoard from Phanigiri (3) dates back to the Ikshvaku period, which falls within the early historic phase. The Neolithic rock carvings in Goa (4) belong to the Neolithic Age, a pre-historic period. Dolmenoid cists (5), a type of megalithic burial structure, are also associated with pre-historic or early historic periods.  Therefore, all five findings relate to early periods in Indian history, making (c) the correct option.  This question demands factual recall of various archaeological discoveries and their chronological contexts, adding to its difficulty.

4.  Mulberry silk, the most common type of silk produced globally.

How many of the above silk types are produced in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) All four
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India produces all four types of silk mentioned: Eri (1), Muga (2), Tasar (3), and Mulberry (4).  The question tests knowledge of India's sericulture industry and the different varieties of silk produced within the country.  All options are plausible distractors as each silk type is indeed produced somewhere in the world. The question's difficulty arises from the need to recall specific details about India's silk production.


**9. Consider the following concerning the concept of Transhumance:**

1.  It is the seasonal movement of livestock between different pastures.

(b) Only three
(c) All four
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the Memory of the World (MOW) Programme. The programme was indeed launched in 1992 (1) and maintains three registers at the international, regional, and national levels (2).  It is a UNESCO initiative focused on preserving significant documentary heritage (3), and specific Indian literary works such as Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana have been included in its Asia-Pacific Regional Register (4).

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Holkar Dynasty?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Holkars were indeed part of the Maratha Confederacy alongside the mentioned dynasties. Statement 2 is incorrect; Moropant's association with Lavani and Powada is linked to Shahir Anantaphandi, not the Holkar Dynasty. Statement 3 is correct; the Holkar rulers fostered women's education and opposed regressive practices like Sati. Statement 4 is correct; Malhar Rao II's defeat resulted in the Treaty of Mandsaur. Thus, three statements (1, 3, and 4) accurately depict the Holkar Dynasty, making (c) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty marked the zenith of the Vijayanagara Empire's power.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw territorial expansion, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors appointed by the Raya, with no military responsibilities.
4.  The Vijayanagara Empire's architectural marvels include the Virupaksha and Vithala temples at Hampi.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Sangama, witnessed the empire's peak. Statement 2 is correct; Krishnadevaraya significantly expanded the empire's territory. Statement 3 is incorrect; Amara-Nayakas were military commanders granted territories to govern, not merely tax collectors. Statement 4 is correct; the Virupaksha and Vithala temples are indeed among Hampi's architectural highlights. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following about the Sangameshwar Temple:**

1.  The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2.  The temple's location is significant due to its position at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers.
3.  Other Sangameshwar temples exist in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.
4.  The Sangameshwar temple in Karnataka is not a part of a UNESCO World Heritage site.

How many of the above statements are factually correct regarding the Sangameshwar Temple?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Statement 2 is correct; the temple's location at the confluence of rivers is crucial to its significance. Statement 3 is correct; Sangameshwar temples are found in the mentioned states. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Sangameshwar temple in Karnataka is part of the Pattadakal group of monuments, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Therefore, three statements (2, 3, and 4) are factually correct, making (c) the correct answer.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Kamakhya Temple:**

1.  The Kamakhya Temple is located on the Nilachal hills in Assam.
2.  The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the annual flooding of the Kamakhya temple.
3.  The temple's architecture is solely based on the Nilachal style.
4.  The temple is one of 51 Shakti Peethas, believed to be where Sati's heart fell.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Kamakhya Temple?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the temple is situated on the Nilachal hills. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; the Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, not temple flooding. Statement 3 is incorrect; the architecture incorporates elements from various styles, including Upper Burmese and Pala styles. Statement 4 is partially correct; it is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, but the belief is that Sati's reproductive organ, not her heart, fell there.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2, with the correction to statement 2) are largely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The inaccuracies within statements 3 and 4 make them significantly less accurate than the other two.


**9. Consider the following about Eri Silk:**

1.  Eri silk is produced by the multivoltine silkworm *Bombyx mori*.
2.  Eri silk is known as the world's only vegan silk due to the non-lethal harvesting process.
3.  The Oeko-Tex certification guarantees the absence of all harmful chemicals in Eri silk.
4.  India produces only four of the five types of silk: Mulberry, Eri, Tropical Tasar, and Muga.

How many of the above statements are factually correct regarding Eri Silk?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Eri silk is produced by *Philosamia ricini*, not *Bombyx mori*. Statement 2 is correct; the non-lethal harvesting method makes it vegan silk. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; Oeko-Tex certification ensures testing for harmful substances but doesn't guarantee their complete absence. Statement 4 is incorrect; India produces all five types of silk, including Temperate Tasar.  Thus, only two statements (2 and 3, with a qualification for 3) are substantially correct, making (b) the correct answer. The inaccuracies in statements 1 and 4 outweigh the partial correctness of statement 3.


**10. Consider the following about Kozhikode:**

1. Kozhikode is located on the Coromandel Coast.
2.  The term "calico" is believed to be derived from Calicut (Kozhikode).
3.  Kozhikode was ruled by the Cholas in the medieval age.
4.  Kozhikode's trade primarily focused on cotton textiles.

How many of the above statements are factually incorrect regarding Kozhikode?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Kozhikode is on the Malabar Coast, not the Coromandel Coast. Statement 2 is correct; "calico" is believed to originate from Calicut's fine cotton cloth. Statement 3 is incorrect; Kozhikode was ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins), not the Cholas, during the medieval period. Statement 4 is partially incorrect; while cotton was traded, Kozhikode's trade was heavily focused on spices like black pepper and cardamom. Three statements (1, 3, and 4) are factually incorrect, making (c) the correct answer.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Ratan Tata's contributions:**

1.  He spearheaded the Tata Group's revenue growth from $5 billion to over $100 billion.
2.  He launched the Tata Nano, a revolutionary low-cost car.
3.  He received the Padma Shri award for his contributions to Indian industry.
4.  Tata Motors received an award from PETA India for using vegan interiors in its AVINYA Concept car.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding Ratan Tata's legacy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of Ratan Tata's leadership and impact.  He oversaw a dramatic expansion of the Tata Group's revenue, making it a global industrial giant. The launch of the Tata Nano represented a significant attempt to provide affordable personal transportation in India.  Tata Motors' recognition by PETA India for its commitment to vegan car interiors showcases a forward-thinking approach to sustainability and ethical practices.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Ratan Tata received the Padma Bhushan (2000) and Padma Vibhushan (2008), not the Padma Shri.  The Padma Shri is a lower-ranking civilian award.  The inclusion of this incorrect award serves as a significant distractor, requiring precise knowledge of his accolades.


**2. Consider the following features associated with the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative:**

1.  It utilizes blockchain technology for enhanced traceability.
2.  It is solely implemented by the Ministry of Textiles.
3.  It aims to improve the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.
4.  It focuses exclusively on organic cotton production.

How many of the above features correctly describe the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and partially 2 are correct.  Blockchain technology is indeed central to the initiative, ensuring complete traceability and transparency in the supply chain. The initiative also aims to boost the global competitiveness of Indian cotton through branding, traceability, and certification. While the Ministry of Textiles plays a crucial role, the implementation involves a joint effort with the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry itself (the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL) is the implementing agency). Statement 4 is incorrect; while the initiative promotes high-quality cotton, it doesn't restrict itself to organic cotton alone.  The inclusion of this statement as a distractor tests the candidate's precise understanding of the program's scope.


**3. Consider the following aspects of the  "Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi" initiative:**

1.  It aims to enhance the tourist experience through trained local ambassadors.
2.  It is limited to five major tourist destinations in India.
3.  It exclusively focuses on employing experienced tourism professionals.
4.  It places special emphasis on training women and youth in tourism-related ventures.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the goals and strategies of the "Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi" initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2 and 4 are accurate. The initiative's core goal is to improve the tourist experience by training local people to act as friendly guides and ambassadors. It is implemented across 50 tourist destinations, not just five, making statement 2 partially correct. The program specifically emphasizes training for women and youth, aiming to empower them economically through tourism-related businesses. Statement 3 is incorrect, as the program also involves training individuals without prior tourism experience.  The inclusion of this distractor requires candidates to understand the program's inclusive nature and avoid making assumptions about its target participants.


**4. Consider the following statements about the  'Antitrust Laws in India':**

1.  They are primarily aimed at preventing monopolies and promoting fair competition.
2.  The Competition Act of 2002 is the principal legislation governing antitrust matters.
3.  These laws primarily focus on protecting consumers from price gouging by large corporations.
4.  The enforcement of these laws is solely the responsibility of the Supreme Court of India.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the 'Antitrust Laws in India'?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  Indian antitrust laws are designed to foster competition and prevent anti-competitive practices like monopolies and cartels. The Competition Act of 2002 is the cornerstone legislation in this area. Statement 3 is partially correct, as consumer protection is a consequence of fair competition, but it's not the *primary* focus of the laws.  The laws also aim to prevent harm to competitors and the economy as a whole. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Supreme Court can adjudicate on antitrust matters, the primary enforcement body is the Competition Commission of India. The inclusion of Statement 4, which is factually incorrect,  acts as a key distractor.


**5. Consider the following regarding the  'Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)' scheme:**

1.  The OCI scheme was introduced by the Indian government in 2015.
2.  An OCI cardholder is granted a lifetime visa for multiple entries into India.
3.  OCI cardholders enjoy all the rights of Indian citizens, except the right to vote.
4.  The OCI scheme is primarily intended for persons of Indian origin residing permanently abroad.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the 'Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)' scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3 and 4 are largely correct.  OCI cardholders are granted a lifetime visa allowing multiple entries into India.  While OCI cardholders do not have voting rights,  they lack several other rights of Indian citizens, such as the right to hold certain government positions. The scheme targets persons of Indian origin living abroad. Statement 1 is incorrect; the OCI scheme was introduced much earlier than 2015; the exact date is not crucial but the fact that it predates 2015 is. This inaccuracy serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the scheme's timeline.




**6. Consider the following about the  '106th Constitutional Amendment' of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It reserves one-fourth of all seats for women in the Lok Sabha.
2.  It mandates reservation of seats for women in local self-government bodies.
3.  It is applicable to the state legislative assemblies of Union Territories.
4.  It aims to enhance women’s representation in political bodies.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the '106th Constitutional Amendment'?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The 106th Amendment primarily deals with reserving seats for women in Panchayats and Municipalities (local self-government bodies).  The overarching aim is to increase women's representation in the political system. Statement 1 is incorrect; it doesn't reserve seats in the Lok Sabha. Statement 3 is incorrect;  the amendment's applicability to Union Territories might vary depending on specific provisions and interpretations; the statement is not entirely accurate. The inclusion of these potentially confusing and partially true statements makes the question challenging.


**7. Consider the following sources of funding for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs):**

1.  Property tax
2.  Finance Commission grants
3.  Lease and advertising revenues
4.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation
5.  User charges for municipal services

How many of the above are typically considered major sources of funding for ULBs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five options are typically major sources of funding for ULBs. Property tax is a direct revenue source. Finance Commission grants provide significant central and state government funding.  Lease and advertising revenues generate income from municipal assets.  While GST compensation is not a direct source of revenue for ULBs, they receive a share of the compensation fund from the state government.  User charges for services like water and sanitation contribute to ULB revenues.  The question is designed to test comprehensive knowledge of ULB funding mechanisms.  It requires the candidate to have a thorough understanding of different revenue streams.


**8. Consider the following statements about the  'Press Council of India (PCI)':**

1.  It is a statutory body established under the Press Council Act.
2.  Its decisions are binding on all newspapers and periodicals in India.
3.  It is empowered to impose penalties, including suspension of publication.
4.  Its members are appointed solely by the government.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the powers and functions of the 'Press Council of India'?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The PCI is a statutory body, and it has the power to impose penalties, including suspension of publication, for serious breaches of journalistic ethics.  Statement 2 is partially true; PCI's decisions are influential, but not strictly binding in a legal sense.  Members are appointed through a process involving government representation but also independent bodies, making statement 4 incorrect. The question design uses a combination of partially true and entirely false statements to test the candidate's in-depth understanding of the PCI's powers and limitations.



**9. Consider the following about the  'Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India':**

1.  It is a constitutional body, established under Article 148 of the Constitution.
2.  It audits the accounts of only the central government.
3.  It reports directly to the Parliament.
4.  Its independence is safeguarded by the Constitution.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the role and status of the CAG of India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The CAG is a constitutional body, directly accountable to Parliament. Its independence is constitutionally protected to ensure its impartiality.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the CAG audits the accounts of both the central and state governments.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the CAG's constitutional status, its reporting mechanism, and the scope of its audit responsibilities.  The inclusion of a demonstrably false statement increases the difficulty level.



**10. Consider the following features of the  '12th Schedule of the Indian Constitution':**

1.  It deals with the powers and responsibilities of municipalities.
2.  It specifies the composition of the Rajya Sabha.
3.  It lists the fundamental rights of citizens.
4.  It was added through a constitutional amendment.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the '12th Schedule' of the Indian Constitution?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The 12th Schedule deals with the powers and responsibilities of municipalities.  The other statements are incorrect; the composition of the Rajya Sabha and fundamental rights are covered elsewhere in the Constitution. While the 12th Schedule was added through an amendment,  specifying the exact amendment is not necessary for this question.  The question tests the candidate's specific knowledge of the 12th Schedule's content, using irrelevant information as distractors.


**11. Consider the following regarding the  'Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence':**

1.  Its chairperson is appointed by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2.  Its members are drawn from both Houses of Parliament.
3.  It has a fixed tenure of five years.
4.  It scrutinizes the functioning of the Ministry of Defence.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the composition and functions of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defence?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha appoints the chairperson.  Members are drawn from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The committee's core function is to scrutinize the Ministry of Defence's activities. Statement 3 is incorrect; committees have a tenure that is not fixed at five years.  This question tests specific knowledge of the committee’s structure and role, using a false statement to raise the difficulty level.


**12. Consider the following regarding the  'Delimitation Commission in India':**

1.  It includes a retired Supreme Court judge as a member.
2.  The Chief Election Commissioner is its ex-officio chairperson.
3.  It comprises representatives from all state legislative assemblies.
4.  It is responsible for redrawing electoral boundaries periodically.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the composition and functions of the Delimitation Commission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The commission includes a retired Supreme Court judge, and its primary function is to redraw electoral boundaries based on census data. Statement 2 is incorrect; the commission has a chairperson appointed separately, not the CEC. Statement 3 is also incorrect; representation is not from all state assemblies but involves other members.  The question tests precise knowledge of the commission's composition and role, using incorrect statements to increase the difficulty.



**13. Consider the following statements about the  'Section 479 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)':**

1.  It deals with the criminalization of marital rape.
2.  It pertains to bail provisions for first-time offenders.
3.  It relates to the criminalization of unnatural sex.
4.  It concerns provisions related to defamation.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the subject matter of Section 479 of the BNSS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 (or potentially 3, depending on the specific interpretation of “unnatural sex” within the BNSS) might be correct, depending on the final wording of the legislation.  The other statements are incorrect;  bail provisions and defamation are covered under other sections of the BNSS.  The question is designed to be highly challenging, requiring precise knowledge of a specific section of a recently enacted law, and thus making it difficult even for those familiar with the overall BNSS.


**14. Consider the following statements about the  'Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)':**

1.  It is a statutory body under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  It regulates both domestic and inter-country adoptions.
3.  It directly handles individual adoption cases.
4.  It is responsible for training adoption agencies.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the functions and responsibilities of CARA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. CARA is a statutory body under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, regulating both domestic and inter-country adoptions.  It also plays a role in training and overseeing adoption agencies. Statement 3 is incorrect; CARA doesn't handle individual cases directly; it sets the standards and guidelines.  The question tests detailed knowledge of CARA's functions, using a statement that is partially true but ultimately incorrect to increase the challenge.


**15. Consider the following about the  'Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum':**

1.  It commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.
2.  It is located near the Bhujio Fort.
3.  It features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.
4.  It was inaugurated in 2001.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The museum commemorates the 2001 Gujarat earthquake victims, is located near Bhujio Fort, and houses a large Miyawaki forest. Statement 4 is incorrect; it was inaugurated in 2022, not 2001.  This question tests specific knowledge of the museum's features and context, using a factual inaccuracy to increase the difficulty.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the 'Dadasaheb Phalke Award'?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest film honor, instituted in 1969 to celebrate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary. The award consists of a Golden Lotus, a shawl, and a cash prize. Statement 2 is incorrect; it is presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  The question tests specific knowledge about the award, using an incorrect statement to enhance the difficulty.

1.  It recognizes excellence in sustainable architecture.
2.  It is awarded annually by the French Ministry of Culture.
3.  The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received this award in 2023.
4.  It focuses exclusively on public buildings.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNESCO's Prix Versailles award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and partially 4 are correct. The award recognizes excellent architecture, emphasizing sustainability.  Kempegowda International Airport received the award in 2023. While the award often includes public buildings, it's not exclusively limited to them, making statement 4 partially incorrect. Statement 2 is incorrect; it is not awarded by the French Ministry of Culture, though it’s a French initiative. This question tests knowledge of the award's criteria and recipients, using partially correct and incorrect statements to increase the difficulty.


**18. Consider the following about the  'Holkar Dynasty':**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's history?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Holkars were part of the Maratha Confederacy, Ahilyabai Holkar was a prominent ruler, and the dynasty's power declined significantly after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Statement 4 is incorrect; their major involvement was in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.  The question tests knowledge of a specific historical dynasty, using an incorrect statement to make the question more challenging.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Shankarseth was a philanthropist and merchant, significantly contributing to Mumbai's development and advocating for women's education. Statement 3 is incorrect; he was not primarily involved in the independence movement.  This question tests knowledge of a historical figure's contributions, using a distractor to increase the difficulty.


**20. Consider the following about the  'Vijayanagara Empire':**

1.  The Sangama dynasty was its founding dynasty.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked its territorial peak.
3.  It had a decentralized political structure with powerful regional governors.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The Sangama dynasty founded the empire, Krishnadevaraya's reign witnessed its greatest territorial extent, it had a system of powerful regional governors (Amara-Nayakas), and Hampi, its capital, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  This question tests knowledge of a major historical empire, using only correct statements but requiring detailed knowledge to answer confidently.




**1. Consider the following features of the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India:**

1.  Replacement of western attire with a saree.
2.  Open eyes instead of a blindfold.
3.  Substitution of the sword with the Indian Constitution.
4.  Retention of the scales of justice.

How many of the above features symbolize a departure from traditional Western representations of Lady Justice, while simultaneously incorporating Indian cultural elements and legal principles?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four features represent a departure from the traditional Western depiction of Lady Justice and incorporate Indian elements. The saree replaces the traditional Western robe, aligning the statue with Indian tradition.  The open eyes, unlike the traditional blindfold, symbolize that justice is not blind but sees and understands societal complexities and differentiations. The replacement of the sword with the Indian Constitution signifies the supremacy of the Constitution and its core values in the Indian judicial system, emphasizing justice rooted in constitutional principles rather than mere punishment. Finally, the retention of the scales represents the continued impartial weighing of evidence, a fundamental aspect of any justice system, regardless of its cultural context.  Therefore, all four features contribute to a unique Indian interpretation of Lady Justice.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It was a non-violent protest against the exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.
2.  T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan were key leaders of the movement.
3.  The Satyagraha lasted for 604 days and was officially withdrawn after consultations between Gandhi and W.H. Pitt.
4.  The movement resulted in the immediate abolishment of untouchability in Travancore.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against caste-based discrimination regarding temple entry. T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan played crucial roles in leading the movement. The Satyagraha did last for 604 days and concluded after negotiations between Gandhi and W.H. Pitt. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Satyagraha contributed significantly to legal reforms that eventually led to increased access to temples, it did not result in the immediate abolishment of untouchability in Travancore.  The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936 was a landmark legal victory but came years later as a consequence of the movement and other factors.


**3. Consider the following elements related to the Apartheid system in South Africa:**

How many of these statements accurately describe aspects of the Apartheid system and its impact?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. Apartheid was indeed formally institutionalized in 1948. Nelson Mandela's prominent role in the anti-apartheid movement and his imprisonment are well-documented.  The UN's suspension of South Africa in 1974 was a direct consequence of its apartheid policies. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Apartheid system did not exclude Coloured and Indian populations; they were also subjected to significant discrimination and oppression under the system, although the nature and extent of discrimination varied between these groups and Black Africans.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.  The use of standardized weights and measures is strong evidence of a well-organized trade network, both internal and external.  The sophisticated urban planning, as exemplified by the drainage systems in Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, highlights the advanced engineering skills of the civilization. The existence of a pictographic script, though undeciphered, points to a developed system of writing.  The depiction of Pasupati and the Mother Goddess in various forms of art showcases their religious beliefs and practices.  The terracotta figurines reveal artistic skills and cultural practices. Finally, the discovery of the dry dock at Lothal is a testament to their advanced maritime capabilities and understanding of shipbuilding and navigation.  Therefore, all six statements are accurate representations of the Indus Valley Civilization's achievements.


2. Consider the following about the trade and commerce of the Indus Valley Civilization:

1.  Mesopotamian texts refer to the Indus region as Meluha.
2.  Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) served as intermediate trading stations.
3.  Exports primarily consisted of precious metals like gold and silver.
4.  Imports included textiles and timber from distant lands.
5.  The use of standardized weights and measures facilitated trade.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the trade practices of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 accurately reflect aspects of Indus Valley Civilization trade. Mesopotamian records indeed refer to the Indus region as Meluha, indicating established trade links. Dilmun (Bahrain) and Makan (Makran coast) acted as crucial intermediary points in this extensive trade network. The use of standardized weights and measures is a key characteristic of a well-organized and efficient trading system, which is well-documented for the Indus Valley Civilization.  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. While the Indus Valley Civilization did export goods, precious metals are not specifically mentioned as primary exports in available evidence. Similarly, while they imported goods, textiles and timber are not explicitly mentioned as major imports. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 5) are correct.


3. Consider the following statements regarding the religious and cultural practices of the Indus Valley Civilization:

1.  The discovery of numerous temples provides insight into their religious beliefs.
2.  Pasupati, a male deity, is often depicted in a yogic posture on seals.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the religious and cultural aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 accurately depict the religious practices of the Indus Valley Civilization. The depiction of Pasupati in a yogic posture on seals is well-documented.  The Mother Goddess is frequently represented in terracotta figurines, indicating her importance in their religious pantheon. Evidence suggests that phallus (Linga) worship was also prevalent. However, statement 1 is incorrect; no large-scale temples have been definitively identified in Indus sites. Statement 4 is also incorrect as the Harappans' religious practices weren't limited to anthropomorphic representations; they also worshipped nature and symbols.  Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and 5) accurately reflect the religious and cultural aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.


4. Consider the following features of the Indus Valley Civilization's writing system:

1.  The script is entirely alphabetic, similar to modern scripts.

4.  The script has been successfully deciphered, revealing details of their language and history.
5.  The script is pictographic in nature.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization's writing system?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 3 and 5
(d) 1 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 5 correctly describe the Indus script. The script is indeed pictographic, meaning it uses pictures to represent words or ideas.  It also follows a boustrophedon style, where lines alternate between right-to-left and left-to-right directions. However, statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. The script is not entirely alphabetic; it's pictographic. The writing direction wasn't consistently right-to-left; it was boustrophedon.  The script remains undeciphered, preventing a complete understanding of their language and history. Therefore, only statements 3 and 5 are correct.


5. Consider the following about Lothal, a significant site of the Indus Valley Civilization:

1.  Lothal is located on the banks of the river Ganges.
2.  It is known for its advanced irrigation system.
3.  It is famous for its well-preserved granaries.
4.  It features the oldest known man-made dry dock.
5.  Lothal's location hindered its maritime trade activities.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Lothal and its importance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 4 and 3 are accurate. Lothal is indeed famous for having the oldest known man-made dry dock, providing evidence of advanced maritime technology and trade.  While granaries haven't been found in the same level of detail or preservation as in other Indus sites, the presence of storage facilities is implied by the scale and structure of the city.  However, statements 1, 2, and 5 are incorrect. Lothal is situated near the Gulf of Khambhat, not on the Ganges.  While the Indus Valley Civilization had sophisticated urban planning, specific evidence of an advanced irrigation system at Lothal is not definitively established.  Lothal's location near the Gulf of Khambhat actually facilitated its maritime trade. Therefore, only two statements (3 and 4) accurately describe Lothal and its importance.


6. Consider the following regarding the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal:

1.  The NMHC is being developed under the "Green India Mission" program.
2.  It aims to showcase India's maritime heritage only from the colonial period onwards.
3.  The NMHC project is being undertaken solely by the Government of Gujarat.
4.  The NMHC involves the development of a world-class Lighthouse Museum.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NMHC at Lothal?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 4 and 5 are correct. The NMHC at Lothal indeed includes a world-class Lighthouse Museum as a key project, and it's being developed through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model under the Sagarmala Programme. Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. The NMHC is not under the "Green India Mission," but rather the Sagarmala Programme.  It aims to showcase India's maritime heritage from ancient times to the present, not just from the colonial period.  The project is a joint venture between the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways and private entities, not solely undertaken by the Gujarat government.  Therefore, only two statements (4 and 5) accurately describe the NMHC at Lothal.

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The Magadha kingdom is credited with possessing the world's first recorded navy. The Satavahana dynasty did issue coins with ship depictions, reflecting their maritime importance. The Maratha navy under Shivaji's leadership successfully resisted the Portuguese and British for a considerable time. However, statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. The earliest reference to maritime activities is found in the Rig Veda, not the Arthashastra. The Gupta dynasty's maritime trade extended beyond Southeast Asia, encompassing European and African countries. Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and 5) correctly reflect aspects of India's maritime history.


8. Consider the following regarding the Chola dynasty and its maritime expeditions:

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Chola dynasty's maritime power and influence?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are accurate. Nagapattinam was indeed a major port city under the Chola dynasty, facilitating their extensive maritime trade. Rajendra Chola I's naval expeditions did reach Southeast Asia, resulting in conquests in regions like the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Statement 1 is false; the Cholas were renowned for their powerful navy. Statement 2 is incorrect; Rajaraja Chola I's naval reach extended beyond the Indian subcontinent. Statement 5 is incorrect; the Chola navy was instrumental in their expansion and influence. Therefore, only three statements (3, 4, and the implied negation of statements 1, 2, and 5) accurately reflect the Chola dynasty's maritime power and influence.

How many of the above statements correctly describe transhumance?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 4 are correct. Transhumance is a traditional practice involving the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.  UNESCO has indeed recognized certain transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it's an ancient practice. Statement 3 is incorrect; it's prevalent in mountainous and pastoral regions, not just arid ones.  Statement 5 is incorrect; in India, it is predominantly practiced in the Himalayan regions and some plains. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) correctly describe transhumance.


10. Consider the following about the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:

How many of the above statements correctly describe the UNESCO's MOW program and its Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 5 are correct.  The Ramcharitmanas manuscript was indeed included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The MOW program aims to safeguard and preserve documentary heritage of global significance.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the program launched in 1992. Statement 2 is incorrect; it maintains International, Regional, and National Registers. Statement 4 is incorrect; the meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Therefore, only three statements (3 and 5, and the implied negation of 1,2, and 4) correctly describe the UNESCO's MOW program and its Asia-Pacific Regional Register.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Sangameshwar temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is explicitly mentioned as submerging annually. The association of a Karnataka Sangameshwar temple with the Pattadakal UNESCO World Heritage Site is also accurate.  Statement 2 is correct as well, mentioning a temple in Bhavani. Statement 4 is incorrect; Sangameshwar temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu.  The question tests factual recall of specific temple locations and their attributes, including their religious dedication and UNESCO recognition.  The inclusion of statement 4, a false but plausible distractor related to religious affiliation, increases the difficulty.


**2. Consider the following features of the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi:**

1.  It is dedicated to a form of Lord Shiva known as Pampapathi.
2.  The temple's earliest shrine was constructed during the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 2 are correct. The temple's dedication to Pampapathi (a form of Shiva) and the contributions of various dynasties to its construction over centuries are accurate.  However, the temple primarily showcases Dravida style architecture, not Nagara, making statement 3 incorrect. The question tests knowledge of temple architecture styles and the historical development of a specific temple, demanding precise recall of architectural style and historical periods. The inclusion of the incorrect yet plausible distractor regarding the architectural style enhances the question's difficulty.


**3. Consider the following aspects related to the Kamakhya Temple in Assam:**

1.  The Ambubachi Mela celebrates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya.
2.  The temple's present structure was built in the 17th century by the Mughal dynasty.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Ambubachi Mela's significance and the temple's architectural fusion of Upper Burma and Pala styles are correctly described.  Its status as a Shakti Peetha is also accurate.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the temple's reconstruction was undertaken by the Koch dynasty, not the Mughals. This question assesses knowledge of religious festivals, temple architecture styles, and the significance of specific religious sites, requiring detailed recall of historical facts and architectural influences.  The incorrect yet plausible distractor regarding the dynasty responsible for reconstruction adds to the challenge.


**4. Consider the following about the Kesariya Stupa:**

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The stupa's status as the tallest brick-built Buddhist stupa and Xuanzang's mention are accurate.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; it's located in *East* Champaran. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it commemorates Buddha's 22nd sermon, not his first.  The question tests geographical knowledge, historical context, and the significance of Buddhist sites, demanding precise recall of location and historical details. The incorrect yet plausible distractors regarding location and the sermon's significance make the question challenging.

1.  It aimed to connect the Kashi Vishwanath Temple to the banks of the river Yamuna.
2.  The project involved the restoration of temples like Sheetla Mata Temple.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The restoration of smaller temples and the positive economic impact on tourism are accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; the connection was to the Ganges, not the Yamuna. Statement 4 is an oversimplification; while religious significance is a key aspect, the project also encompassed broader infrastructural and economic development. The question tests knowledge of specific development projects, their geographical context, and their economic and social impacts, requiring detailed understanding and discernment of nuanced aspects.  The inclusion of partially correct or misleading statements enhances the difficulty.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Chola Empire's naval power:**

1.  Rajaraja I and Rajendra I were key figures in expanding Chola naval dominance.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The roles of Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, Nagapattinam's importance, and the extent of Chola naval expeditions are accurate.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; their naval power was predominantly focused on the Bay of Bengal, not the Arabian Sea.  The question tests knowledge of ancient Indian history, particularly the maritime power of the Cholas, requiring precise recall of geographical locations and historical figures.  The incorrect yet plausible distractor regarding the sea area adds to the complexity.


**7. Consider the following elements related to the Mahabodhi Temple Complex:**

1.  It is located in Bodh Gaya, Uttar Pradesh.
2.  The main temple's architecture is a distinct blend of Dravida and Nagara styles.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The unique architectural style (neither purely Dravida nor Nagara), the presence of the Vajrasana, and the sacred Bodhi Tree are accurate features. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the temple is located in Bihar, not Uttar Pradesh.  This question assesses geographical knowledge, architectural styles, and religious significance, requiring precise recall of location and detailed knowledge of temple features. The incorrect but plausible distractor concerning the state adds to the difficulty.

Statement 4 is also incorrect; AIM primarily supports students, startups, and entrepreneurs. This question tests knowledge of government initiatives, their administrative structures, and their objectives, demanding precise recall of organizational details and policy goals. The inclusion of inaccurate but plausible statements related to the ministry and target beneficiaries enhances the difficulty.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958:**

1.  It mandates the annual assessment of all centrally protected monuments for their continued national importance.
2.  It explicitly defines the term "missing monuments" to address the issue of untraceable sites.
3.  It empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed no longer of national importance.
4.  It solely focuses on the protection of structures and not on the preservation of associated sculptures or carvings.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct.  The AMASR Act, 1958, indeed grants the Central Government the power to delist monuments if they are assessed as no longer holding national importance. This is central to the news regarding the delisting of "untraceable" monuments by the ASI.

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. The act doesn't mandate annual assessments of all monuments.  The term "missing monuments" is not explicitly defined in the act; it's a term used later by the CAG.  Finally, the act explicitly includes the protection of sculptures and carvings associated with ancient monuments, not just the structures themselves.


**2. Consider the following regarding Nalanda University:**

1. Its establishment was primarily driven by the need to preserve ancient Buddhist scriptures.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The 2nd EAS meeting did indeed provide the impetus for the modern Nalanda University's establishment. King Harshavardhana was a significant patron of the original Nalanda University.

Statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. While preserving knowledge was a part of Nalanda's function, it wasn't the *primary* driver behind its establishment.  The curriculum was far broader than just religious studies, encompassing various disciplines like medicine, astronomy, and politics.


**3. Consider the following statements about the National Film Awards:**

1. They were initially known as "President's Awards".
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since their inception.

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are correct. The National Film Awards do indeed include categories for both feature and non-feature films. They were initially called "State Awards," not "President's Awards."

Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. The Directorate of Film Festivals took over administration in 1973, not from the beginning. The "Most Film-Friendly State" award is not a recent addition; it's been given alongside the main awards for some time.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 1 are incorrect. While the award does consider local heritage and ecological efficiency, it's not limited to historically significant projects.  The Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru received the award in 2023, but it wasn't the first Indian project to be recognized.

Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. The award is presented annually, not biennially, and has no regional rotation.


**5. Consider the following personalities associated with Nalanda University:**

2.  Xuan Zang, a renowned Chinese scholar who studied there.

How many of the above are correctly associated with Nalanda University?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. Ruskin Bond is a recipient, and it is the highest honour the Akademi bestows.

Statement 1 is incorrect; while the number of recipients is limited, it's not awarded annually. Statement 2 is incorrect; the fellowship is not restricted to poets but recognizes literary contributions across genres.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Khelo India program is designed for both grassroots and elite levels, making statement 1 incorrect.  TOPS offers comprehensive support beyond funding, including coaching, equipment, and international exposure, refuting statement 2.  The RESET program assists retired sportspersons (20-50 years), not young athletes transitioning to professional sports, making statement 3 false.  The One School-One Sport policy is currently limited to Sainik Schools, not all schools in India, rendering statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


2. Consider the following regarding India's performance in the Olympic Games:

1. India's best Olympic performance was in Paris 2024.

Therefore, at least two statements are incorrect (possibly three).

(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe facets of the Chola Empire's naval power and its consequences. Rajaraja I's military prowess is well-documented, including his decisive naval victory against the Cheras at Kandalursalai.  Rajendra I's conquests significantly expanded Chola territory, with Sri Lanka becoming a province under his rule. The Chola navy's control over the Bay of Bengal was instrumental in fostering extensive trade networks with Southeast Asian nations, a key aspect of their "Look East" policy. Nagapattinam thrived as a major port and trading hub during this period.  Finally, Rajendra I's expeditions led to the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the reach and power of the Chola navy.  These facts are well-established in historical accounts and demonstrate the empire's maritime strength and its impact on regional politics and trade.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect ICOMOS's involvement in the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative and the characteristics of transhumance. ICOMOS, indeed, leads the initiative, and the definition of transhumance accurately reflects its core practice.  The recognition of the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland as an intangible cultural heritage is also a fact.  The presence of transhumance in the Himalayas and the mention of specific nomadic tribes are also correct. However, statement 5 is an oversimplification of ICOMOS's mandate. While ICOMOS does focus on the preservation of cultural heritage, its scope extends beyond just ancient monuments and historical sites; it encompasses a broader range of cultural and natural heritage aspects, including intangible cultural heritage like transhumance.

However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the final was held in the Americas, it was in the West Indies, not solely in the USA.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; the ICC's headquarters are located in Dubai, UAE, not London. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate regarding the 2024 T20 World Cup.


**4. Consider the following regarding the renaming of Port Blair:**

1.  Port Blair was renamed Sri Vijaya Puram.
2.  The renaming commemorates Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's unfurling of the Indian flag.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the reasons and significance behind the renaming of Port Blair?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements correctly reflect the reasons and significance behind the renaming of Port Blair to Sri Vijaya Puram.  The renaming itself is a fact. The connection to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's unfurling of the Indian flag there is also well-established. The name change is intended to highlight the islands' role in India's freedom movement and to mark a departure from colonial history.  The Cellular Jail's location in the renamed city is also accurate.  Therefore, all five statements provide accurate context for the renaming.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas manuscript is included in the register.
2.  The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works only.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register and related details?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Ramcharitmanas is indeed included in the register. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Ulaanbaatar, and the program's launch year is also accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the register includes works from across the Asia-Pacific region, not just from India. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while the Panchatantra is a collection of Indian fables, it predates the 16th century.  Thus, only three statements are completely accurate.


**6. Consider the following about the National Film Awards:**

1.  The awards were initially called "State Awards".
2.  The Directorate of Film Festivals has administered the awards since 1973.
3.  Awards are given in only two categories: Feature Films and Non-Feature Films.
4.  The "Most Film Friendly State" award is presented alongside the National Film Awards.
5.  The awards were established in 1954.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the National Film Awards?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are accurate. The awards were initially known as "State Awards," the Directorate of Film Festivals took over administration in 1973, the "Most Film Friendly State" award is part of the scheme, and the awards were established in 1954. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the awards are given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema.  Therefore, four statements accurately reflect information about the National Film Awards.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM):**

1.  Mahatma Gandhi's activities in South Africa laid the groundwork for the AAM.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Anti-Apartheid Movement and its key aspects?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are accurate representations of the AAM. Gandhi's early activism in South Africa undeniably influenced the movement's development. The AAM did indeed pursue both internal and external strategies to dismantle apartheid. Yusuf Mohamed Dadoo played a crucial role within the movement. The AAM's efforts, along with international pressure, ultimately led to the dismantling of apartheid by 1990. However, statement 4 is slightly inaccurate; while India was among the first to condemn apartheid and sever trade relations, it wasn't the very first country to impose comprehensive sanctions.  Therefore, four out of the five statements correctly describe the AAM.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 correctly describe Indian government initiatives. The Khelo India program's dual focus is accurate. TOPS indeed provides comprehensive support to elite athletes. The FIT India Movement's integration into the National Education Policy 2020 is also a fact. The RESET Programme's aim to empower retired sportspersons is also accurate.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the National Sports Development Fund doesn't primarily support athletes from Sainik Schools; its scope is broader.  Therefore, four out of the five statements accurately reflect Indian government sports initiatives.


**9. Consider the following about the Ancient Nalanda University:**

1.  It was founded by Kumargupta I.
2.  It was a monastic university, a Mahavihara.
3.  Its library, Dharma Gunj, held over nine million books.
4.  Theravada Buddhism was one of the major disciplines taught.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the ancient Nalanda University?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe aspects of the ancient Nalanda University.  Its founding by Kumargupta I, its Mahavihara structure, the vast collection of books in its Dharma Gunj library, the prominence of Theravada Buddhism as a subject, and its merit-based admissions system with trained examiners are all well-documented facts about the university's history and operation.  Therefore, all five statements are correct.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the roles and responsibilities of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe aspects of the ASI's functions.  The ASI's role in regulating excavations, protecting artifacts, and coordinating antiquity recovery are well-established.  Section 4 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, does empower the Central Government (and subsequently, the ASI) to declare monuments of national importance. However, statement 5 is incorrect. While the ASI is involved in the preservation of monuments, the National Monuments Authority (NMA) is a separate entity established under the Ministry of Culture, not directly managed by the ASI.  Therefore, four out of the five statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate representations of the Chola Empire's naval prowess. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I were instrumental in expanding the empire's maritime influence through aggressive military policies and naval expeditions.  The Bay of Bengal became essentially a "Chola lake," facilitating extensive trade with Southeast Asian nations. Nagapattinam was a major port city and trading hub, vital to the empire's economic strength.  Their naval power was demonstrated by successful conquests of Sri Lanka and parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (Sailendra Empire).  Therefore, option (d) is correct.

(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are accurate.  The TOPS scheme does indeed provide comprehensive support to India's top athletes.  Budgetary allocation for sports has seen a substantial increase. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Khelo India program also focuses on grassroots development. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the "One School-One Sport" policy is specifically mentioned for Sainik Schools, not all schools in India. Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.


**4. Consider the following about UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the *Ramayana*.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

The MOW program's launch date and the three-tiered register structure are also accurate.  The *Panchatantra* and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* were included. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while the text mentions the inclusion of *Ramcharitmanas*, it does not mention the *Ramayana*. Therefore, three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor:**

(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The corridor project aims to improve accessibility to the temple from the Ganges. The foundation stone was laid in 2019, and the project is also known as Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham. However, statement 3 is incorrect;  the corridor projects in Gaya and Bodh Gaya were *inspired* by the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, not the other way around. Thus, three statements are correct.

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The initiative aims to improve tourist experiences by training local people as ambassadors, and it prioritizes training women and youth. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it's not limited to experienced professionals, and statement 4 is incorrect; it covers 50, not all, tourist destinations.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following related to the  Indian Olympic Association (IOA):**

1.  Sir Dorabji Tata was the IOA's first president.
2.  The IOA was formed in 1927 and recognized by the IOC the same year.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect India's Olympic performance?

(b) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is partially correct. While the statement says that India's Olympic ranking *improved*, it actually fell from 48th to 71st.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are all incorrect.  India won fewer medals in Paris than in Tokyo, did not win a gold medal in Paris, and Paris was not its best Olympic performance. Therefore, only one statement (partially) reflects the situation accurately.

1.  The awards were initially called "State Awards."

Rajendra I continued this naval tradition, conquering Sri Lanka and expanding Chola influence into Southeast Asia, specifically the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Nagapattinam's role as a major trading center underscores the importance of Chola naval power in facilitating trade and commerce across the Indian Ocean.  The Chola navy's success was crucial to their economic prosperity and political dominance in the region.  Each statement reflects a historically documented aspect of Chola maritime history.

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The MOW program was indeed launched in 1992, aiming to preserve significant documentary heritage. The inclusion of the mentioned Indian literary works in the Asia-Pacific Regional Register is also a fact. Finally, the 10th MOWCAP meeting's location in Ulaanbaatar is correctly stated. Statement 4 is false; the MOW program maintains International, Regional, and National Registers.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

The vast library, known as "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth," is legendary for its extensive collection, although the exact number of books is debated and likely an exaggeration.  Aryabhatta's association with Nalanda is well-documented in historical accounts. Xuan Zang's pilgrimage and studies at Nalanda under Chancellor Shilabhadra are also well-known events in the history of Buddhism and scholarship. Finally, the destruction of Nalanda by Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205 AD marks a significant turning point in its history and the decline of Buddhist learning in the region.

Four out of the five statements accurately describe events related to the Kakori and Lahore Conspiracy cases. Ram Prasad Bismil was a key figure in the Kakori Conspiracy.  Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru's execution following the Lahore Conspiracy is a well-known historical event. Jatin Das's death during a hunger strike protesting prison conditions is also a documented fact.

(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements accurately reflect the nature of the Apartheid system and related events. The Apartheid system was indeed a legally enforced system of racial discrimination.  However, while its roots were in earlier discriminatory laws, its full institutionalization occurred in 1948, not the 19th century.  Indians in South Africa were significantly impacted by Apartheid laws, experiencing segregation and discrimination.  Mahatma Gandhi's early activism in South Africa laid some groundwork for future anti-apartheid movements. Finally, the Anti-Apartheid Movement was a transnational movement, not solely a South African initiative, with international support and participation playing a crucial role.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

He was indeed the first Indian to win an individual gold medal at the Olympics. The Olympic Order is awarded by the IOC.  And Abhinav Bindra was honored with the Olympic Order for his contributions.

**Explanation:**

Three statements are correct. The first Commonwealth Games were indeed held in Hamilton, Canada. India successfully hosted the Games in Delhi in 2010.  India did win medals in badminton, cricket, and hockey at the 2022 CWG. However, the CWG 2026 will feature *fewer* sports than the 2022 edition, not more.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements are accurate. The 45th Chess Olympiad was held in Budapest, Hungary.  India achieved a remarkable victory by winning gold in both the open and women's categories. The 44th Chess Olympiad was indeed held in Chennai. The Hamilton-Russell Cup is awarded to the open section winner. And D. Gukesh's victory in the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, while not directly part of the Olympiad, is a significant recent achievement in Indian chess. Therefore, all five statements are correct.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four statements correctly describe the Act's provisions and related functions.  The Act does regulate archaeological excavations and protects artifacts. It empowers the Central Government to declare monuments of national importance.  It prevents the export of antiquities.  The ASI plays a key role in the recovery of traced antiquities. However, the National Monuments Authority (NMA) was established by the AMASR (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010, not the original 1972 Act. Therefore, only four statements are accurate.

How many of these statements accurately represent the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately describe the Vaikom Satyagraha. It was a non-violent protest for temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.  It occurred in Travancore (present-day Kerala).  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was a crucial figure in mobilizing support.  However, while Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement, he did not lead it directly.  And the Satyagraha did not achieve immediate temple entry for all castes; legal reforms followed later.  Therefore, only three statements are completely accurate.



**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Rajaraja Chola I's naval victory at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra Chola I's conquest of the Sailendra Empire.
3. The annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka under Chola rule.
4. The Chola conquest of the Maldives.

How many of the above represent significant naval expeditions or territorial acquisitions by the Cholas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements accurately reflect significant naval actions or territorial expansions under the Chola empire. Rajaraja Chola I's victory at Kandalursalai decisively crippled the Chera navy, establishing Chola dominance in the region. Rajendra Chola I's campaign against the Sailendra Empire resulted in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the reach of Chola naval power. The annexation of northern Sri Lanka and the conquest of the Maldives further demonstrate the Chola empire's extensive maritime influence and territorial control.  These events are well-documented in historical records and represent key milestones in the expansion and consolidation of the Chola empire.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the statements.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding transhumance:**

1. It is a practice primarily limited to the Himalayan region of India.
2. It involves the seasonal migration of pastoral communities and their livestock.
3.  Transhumance traditions in Europe have been recognized by UNESCO.
4.  Gujars, Bakarwals, and Gaddis are nomadic tribes practicing transhumance in the Indian plains.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 accurately describes transhumance as the seasonal movement of pastoral communities along with their herds. Statement 3 is correct; UNESCO has recognized certain European transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages.  However, statement 1 is incorrect because while transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it is also practiced in other parts of India, including the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Statement 4 is also incorrect;  the mentioned tribes primarily practice transhumance in the Himalayan region, not the plains. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following:**

1. The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, outlines procedures for delisting monuments.
2. The National Monuments Authority (NMA) manages prohibited areas near centrally protected monuments.
3. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments of national importance.
4. The term "Missing Monuments" is officially used in the AMASR Act to describe untraceable monuments.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the legal and constitutional framework for the protection of monuments in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly reflect aspects of the legal and constitutional framework. The AMASR Act does indeed provide legal basis for delisting monuments based on a loss of national importance. The NMA, established under an amendment to the AMASR Act, plays a crucial role in managing areas surrounding protected monuments. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution, as a Directive Principle of State Policy, mandates the protection of nationally significant monuments. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act.  It's a descriptor used informally. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding Nalanda University:**

1.  It was established under the Nalanda University Act, 2010.
2.  The 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in 2007 provided the foundation for its establishment.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The Nalanda University Act of 2010 formally established the modern university. The 2nd EAS meeting in 2007 laid the groundwork for its creation. The new campus incorporates sustainable design principles, aiming for a "Net Zero" environmental footprint. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While Vedic studies might have been present, the ancient Nalanda University was known for its diverse curriculum encompassing various disciplines like Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana), fine arts, medicine, astronomy, politics, and military strategy.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the delisting of monuments by ASI:**

1.  The ASI intends to delist monuments deemed to lack national importance.
2.  Kos Minar No. 13 in Haryana is among the monuments facing delisting.
3.  The decision to delist is based solely on reports from the Ministry of Culture.
4.  Delisting means the monument will continue to receive conservation from ASI.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the ASI's delisting process?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The ASI's delisting initiative targets monuments assessed as lacking national significance, and Kos Minar No. 13 is among those considered.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the Ministry of Culture's report is a significant factor, the decision involves a comprehensive evaluation process. Statement 4 is also incorrect; delisting removes ASI's conservation and protection responsibilities. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

1. It is a symbol of fearlessness.
2.  It is associated with the fifth Dhyani Buddha, Amoghasiddhi.
3.  It represents the posture used by Buddha to tame a mad elephant.
4.  It is identical in meaning and representation to the Bhumisparsha Mudra.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Abhaya Mudra?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately depict the Abhaya Mudra. It symbolizes fearlessness, is associated with Amoghasiddhi, and represents the Buddha's posture in taming a mad elephant. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Bhumisparsha Mudra has a distinct meaning (calling the earth to witness), representing a different aspect of Buddha's life and teachings.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following about the India-US Cultural Property Agreement:**

1.  It aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities from India to the USA.
2.  It restricts the importation of all Indian-origin material into the United States.
3.  It ensures the immediate repatriation of all seized Indian antiquities.
4.  It was signed during the 46th World Heritage Committee meeting in New Delhi.

How many of the statements accurately reflect the India-US Cultural Property Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are accurate. The agreement primarily focuses on preventing illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities to the USA, and it was signed on the sidelines of the 46th World Heritage Committee meeting in New Delhi. However, statement 2 is an oversimplification;  the agreement restricts the importation of *specific* archaeological and ethnological material of Indian origin, not all material. Statement 3 is also inaccurate; while the agreement facilitates repatriation, it doesn't guarantee immediate return in all cases.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.


**8. Consider the following about megalithic culture:**

2.  Megalithic structures are exclusively associated with burial practices.
3.  Megalithic peoples lived a completely nomadic lifestyle.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are accurate. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a form of semi-subterranean chamber tomb within megalithic traditions. The three categories mentioned in statement 4 represent the diversity of megalithic structures. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while burial is a significant association, megalithic sites also served other purposes. Statement 3 is also incorrect; megalithic populations exhibited a semi-nomadic lifestyle, not a completely nomadic one. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding Phanigiri:**

1. It is a Buddhist site located approximately 110 km from Hyderabad.
2. Excavations have unearthed a Mahastupa and Chaitya Grihas.
3.  It is known for its significant Jain structures and sculptures.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. Phanigiri is a Buddhist site near Hyderabad, excavations have revealed a Mahastupa and Chaitya Grihas, and evidence suggests the co-existence of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist traditions. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Phanigiri is primarily a Buddhist site, not a Jain site. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Prix Versailles award recognizes projects that contribute to improving the living environment, and Kempegowda International Airport is a recipient.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Smritivan Museum is not explicitly mentioned as a Prix Versailles recipient in the provided text. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while architectural quality is a factor, the award's focus is broader, emphasizing the enhancement of the living environment. Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. It is indeed India's highest film award, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, and instituted to honor Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary.

How many of the above statements are accurate about the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Lothal was a significant city, and evidence indicates a well-developed system of standardized weights and measures.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Indus script remains undeciphered. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while deities like Pasupati are prominent, the civilization's religious beliefs were complex and not centered around a single, clearly defined god. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**13. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty was the first ruling dynasty.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Sangama dynasty founded the empire, the Tuluva dynasty witnessed its peak, and Krishnadevaraya's rule included territorial expansion.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. Gandhi Sarovar is indeed known as Chorabari Tal, it originates from the specified glacier, and the Kedarnath Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; Gandhi Sarovar is a natural lake, not a man-made reservoir. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, situated at the confluence of the mentioned rivers, and located in Nandyal district. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the temple's submergence is an annual occurrence related to the Srisailam dam's backwaters, not limited to the monsoon season. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The temple's location, the Ambubachi Mela's significance, and its status as a Shakti Peetha are all accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power and its impact?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe facets of the Chola Empire's naval power.  Rajaraja I's naval dominance, particularly his victory over the Chera navy, laid the groundwork for expansion into Southeast Asia (Statement 1). This naval strength facilitated extensive trade networks with countries in the region, bolstering the Chola economy (Statement 2). Nagapattinam's role as a major port underscores the importance of maritime trade to the empire (Statement 3). Finally, Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province, a testament to the empire's naval capabilities (Statement 4).  These points collectively highlight the Chola's mastery of naval power and its impact on their geopolitical influence and economic prosperity. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the statements.

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct as transhumance intrinsically involves the seasonal movement of livestock between different grazing grounds.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while prevalent in mountainous regions, transhumance also occurs in plains regions of India, as mentioned in the text regarding Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. Statement 3 is accurate; UNESCO has indeed recognized certain transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages. Statement 4 is also correct, as sheep and goat rearing are commonly associated with transhumance in the Himalayan regions of India.  The inclusion of statement 2 as a distractor plays on the common association of transhumance with mountainous areas, while the other statements highlight key characteristics of the practice.


**3. Consider the following about the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC):**

1.  The IVC was a bronze-age civilization with a well-developed urban planning system.
2.  The civilization primarily relied on agriculture, with wheat and rice being staple crops.

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate representations of aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization. The IVC was indeed a bronze-age civilization exhibiting sophisticated urban planning, evident in its grid-patterned cities (Statement 1). Agriculture formed the backbone of the IVC's economy, with wheat and rice as major crops (Statement 2). The IVC possessed a unique pictographic script, though it remains undeciphered to this day (Statement 3).  The discovery of a dry dock at Lothal provides compelling evidence of advanced shipbuilding and nautical understanding within the civilization (Statement 4).  The question's design aims to test the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of the IVC.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Kalinga Dynasty:**

1.  The Kalinga War (261 BCE) led to Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism.

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) All four
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The Kalinga War, fought between Ashoka and Kalinga, resulted in Ashoka's renunciation of violence and conversion to Buddhism (Statement 1). The Kalinga Dynasty's geographical reach included Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh (Statement 2).  Kharavela's reign is well-documented by his patronage of Jainism and the Hathigumpha inscription, which details his military campaigns (Statement 3).  Srikakulam's historical connection to the Kalinga Dynasty, even if not its primary center, is mentioned in the text's description of Srikakulam's history (Statement 4).  The question tests recall of historical details and their interconnections.

How many of the above statements are accurate concerning the Ahom Dynasty?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Ahoms were indeed descendants of the Tai race who migrated from Yunnan (Statement 1).  They embraced Shaivism and the Shakti cult, constructing various temples in Assam (Statement 2).  Sukaphaa's role in founding the dynasty is well-established (Statement 3). However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Ahom Dynasty was a monarchy, power wasn't solely vested in the king. A significant council of ministers (Patra Mantris) played a crucial role in governance, even influencing the selection of kings.  The question highlights the complexity of the Ahom political structure, requiring nuanced understanding beyond simplistic characterizations.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of semi-subterranean chamber tomb characteristic of megalithic burial practices (Statement 1).  The Hire Benkal site is mentioned in the text as being under consideration for UNESCO recognition (Statement 3). Statement 2 is incorrect; while iron was associated with the Megalithic period, it wasn't the exclusive feature of burials. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Megalithic cultures practiced a semi-nomadic lifestyle, not a fully nomadic one.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific terminology and nuances within the description of Megalithic culture.


**7. Consider the following regarding the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Programme:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Kathputli is a glove puppet tradition from Rajasthan (Statement 1). Ravanachhaya is a shadow puppet tradition from Odisha (Statement 3), and Pavakoothu is a glove puppet tradition from Kerala (Statement 4).  Statement 2 is incorrect; Tholu Bommalata is a shadow puppet tradition of Andhra Pradesh, not a rod puppet tradition of Tamil Nadu. The question tests knowledge of specific regional variations in Indian puppetry forms.  The incorrect option is designed to mislead candidates familiar with South Indian puppetry traditions.


**9. Consider the following regarding India's Handloom Industry:**

1. National Handloom Day commemorates the Swadeshi Movement launched on August 7, 1905.
2. The handloom industry is India's largest cottage industry and a major rural employment provider.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics and incorporating the specified criteria.  Note that the economic aspects are somewhat limited in the source material, so some questions will draw broader connections to related economic concepts.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The  Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project's impact on tourism revenue.
2.  The  economic impact of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake on Bhuj.
3.  The potential economic benefits of the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal.
4.  The effect of the annual submersion of the Sangameshwar Temple on local tourism.

How many of the above directly relate to the economic consequences of heritage preservation or natural disasters in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project directly impacts the economy through increased tourism and related revenue generation (1). The 2001 Gujarat earthquake had significant economic consequences for Bhuj, impacting infrastructure, livelihoods, and requiring substantial rebuilding efforts (2).  The NMHC at Lothal is explicitly designed to boost tourism and contribute to the economy (3).  The annual flooding and submersion of the Sangameshwar Temple affect local tourism and potentially associated economic activities (4).  Therefore, three of the statements directly relate to economic consequences.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the economic impact of cultural heritage:**

1.  The UNESCO Prix Versailles award for the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru can attract foreign investment.
2.  The restoration of the Vishnupad Temple in Gaya could stimulate local employment and income.
3.  The inclusion of Ramcharitmanas in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register directly increases GDP.
4.  The development of the Buddhist circuit in Andhra Pradesh under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme primarily serves religious purposes with minimal economic impact.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect potential economic effects of cultural heritage preservation or promotion?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A prestigious award like the UNESCO Prix Versailles can enhance the international reputation of Bengaluru's airport and attract more tourists and foreign investment (1).  Temple restoration projects, like that of the Vishnupad Temple, often create jobs and stimulate local economies through related businesses and services (2).  While the inclusion in the Memory of the World Register has positive symbolic value, it does not directly translate into a quantifiable increase in GDP (3). The Swadesh Darshan Scheme aims to promote tourism, thereby having an economic impact, contradicting statement 4. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect potential economic effects.


**3. Consider the following aspects of economic development related to cultural heritage sites:**

Nagarjunakonda, a significant Buddhist center, would have supported a substantial population and related economic activities (3). Phanigiri's excavations reveal economic activity through its trade connections and the presence of a large Buddhist complex (4).  Therefore, all four sites provide evidence of significant economic activities in ancient India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at being "difficult" due to the inclusion of nuanced details and plausible distractors.

2.  The Olympic flag features five interlocking rings, representing the five continents.
3.  The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was established in 1983 to resolve legal disputes related to the Olympic Games.
4.  India's best-ever Olympic performance was in the Paris 2024 Olympics.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The motto "Citius, Altius, Fortius" (Faster, Higher, Stronger) is indeed the official motto of the modern Olympic Games.  Statement 2 is also correct; the five interlocking rings symbolize the five continents. Statement 3 is accurate; the CAS was established in 1983 to handle legal issues within the Olympic movement. However, Statement 4 is incorrect. While Paris 2024 was India's third-best performance, it wasn't their best ever.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly correct statements.  The distractors are plausible because they are closely related to Olympic facts, requiring precise knowledge for correct identification.

1. It was a non-violent protest against the exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.
2.  It lasted for exactly 600 days.
3.  Mahatma Gandhi played a significant role in initiating the movement.
4.  The Akalis of Punjab provided crucial support to the Satyagrahis.
5.  The movement resulted in the immediate and complete opening of all access routes to the temple.

How many of the statements above are factually accurate regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against caste-based exclusion from the temple, and the Akalis did provide support.  Statement 3 is partially correct; while Gandhi supported the movement, he didn't initiate it.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Satyagraha lasted for 604 days, not 600. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while the Satyagraha led to legal reforms, it didn't immediately and completely open all access routes. The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to discern partially true statements from entirely accurate ones, making it a challenging question.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Kakori Train Action:**

1.  It was orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
2.  The primary objective was to fund revolutionary activities through the robbery of a British treasury train.

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the Kakori Train Action.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the action took place in Uttar Pradesh, not Bengal. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while some key figures were sentenced to death, not all involved received that punishment.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the event, including location and sentencing details, making it a difficult question.  The inclusion of Bengal as a distractor uses geographical proximity to create confusion.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Apartheid system in South Africa:**

1. It was a system of racial segregation imposed primarily by White Afrikaners.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 are correct.  The Apartheid system was indeed imposed by White Afrikaners, officially institutionalized in 1948 (though preceded by discriminatory laws), and ended in 1994. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the AAM was a significant international movement.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; Indians in South Africa were significantly affected by the Apartheid system.  This question tests knowledge of a significant historical event, its nuances, and the associated movement, making it a challenging question with plausible but incorrect distractors.

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The ASI does delist untraceable monuments, the process is governed by Section 35 of the AMASR Act, and Article 49 of the Constitution mandates the protection of monuments. Statement 3 is incorrect; "Missing Monuments" is not a formally recognized term in the Act. Statement 5 is also incorrect; Kos Minar monuments are found in various locations across Northern India, not exclusively in Uttar Pradesh.  The question tests knowledge of the legal framework and specific examples related to the preservation of historical monuments. The distractors use close but incorrect details to create a difficult question.


1. Consider the following statements about the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Maldives and parts of the Malay Peninsula.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power and its impact.  Rajaraja I's military prowess extended to naval dominance, as evidenced by his decisive victory over the Chera navy at Kandalursalai. This victory solidified Chola control over key maritime routes and resources.  Rajendra I continued this naval tradition, expanding Chola influence through successful expeditions to the Maldives and significant regions within the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (part of the Sailendra Empire).  His conquests significantly broadened Chola territorial control and trade networks. The complete annexation of Sri Lanka under Rajendra I also underscores the effectiveness of Chola naval power in achieving strategic objectives. Finally, Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading center highlights the Chola Empire's reliance on and mastery of maritime trade, which was heavily facilitated by their powerful navy.  The Chola navy was not just a military force; it was instrumental in the empire's economic prosperity and geopolitical standing.

Only two statements accurately reflect the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative and transhumance. Statement 2 is correct; ICOMOS, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, indeed leads this initiative. Statement 4 is also correct; UNESCO has recognized the Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, reflecting a transhumance tradition.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while ICOMOS is involved, the initiative focuses on the intangible cultural heritage of transhumance, not primarily on monuments. Statement 3 is incorrect; transhumance is fundamentally linked to the seasonal movement of pastoralist communities, not sedentary agricultural ones.  Transhumance involves the migration of both livestock and human communities, a defining characteristic of nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralism.


3. Consider the following concerning UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:

1. The register exclusively features manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region.

Statement 3 is incorrect; the MoW program was launched in 1992, not 2000. Statement 4 is incorrect; the MoW program maintains International, Regional, and National Registers, not solely at the national level.  The regional register highlights the importance of preserving cultural heritage across geographical boundaries, demonstrating the collaborative efforts of UNESCO in safeguarding global memory.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements are correct. Statement 3 is correct: the IOA was indeed formed in 1927. Statement 4 is correct: Norman Pritchard did represent India at the 1900 Paris Olympics.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while Paris 2024 was India's third-best performance, it wasn't the best. Statement 2 is incorrect; India did not win a gold medal in Paris 2024.  The information reflects the historical context of India's Olympic journey, highlighting the evolution of its participation and the ongoing efforts to improve its performance on the global stage.

**Explanation:**

Only two statements correctly reflect the stated initiatives. Statement 3 is accurate: the National Sports Development Fund indeed supports athletes with Olympic medal potential.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Khelo India program encompasses both grassroots and elite-level athlete development. Statement 2 is incorrect; TOPS offers comprehensive support, including funding, coaching, and international exposure, not just financial aid. Statement 4 is incorrect; the One School-One Sport policy is currently implemented in Sainik Schools, not all schools in India.  The initiatives reveal the multi-faceted approach India is taking to nurture sporting talent, from grassroots identification to high-performance support, indicating a commitment to developing a strong and sustainable sports ecosystem.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements are correct. Statement 1 is accurate; the ASI plays a central role in the delisting process, based on assessments of national importance. Statement 2 is also correct; delisting means a monument is no longer considered nationally significant and thus loses its protected status under the ASI. Statement 3 is correct; Kos Minar No.13 is among the monuments considered for delisting. Statement 4 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act; it emerged from CAG audit reports.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 3 is also correct; the mudra is featured in the narrative of Buddha's interaction with a mad elephant.  Statement 2 is incorrect; it's primarily associated with Amoghasiddhi, not Amitabha. Statement 4 is incorrect; while mudras are related to yoga, Abhaya Mudra is a specific hand gesture, not a full asana (physical posture).  The Abhaya Mudra, within a broader context of Buddhist iconography, represents the reassurance and protection offered by the Buddha, highlighting the importance of symbolic representation in religious and cultural traditions.

4.  The museum was inaugurated in 2023.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum was indeed built to remember the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. Its location on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, alongside the historical Bhujio Fort, is also correct. The presence of one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests within the museum complex is also factually accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the museum was inaugurated in 2022, not 2023.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The inclusion of the year of inauguration as a distractor adds to the question's difficulty, requiring precise factual recall.


**2. Consider the following awards conferred upon individuals for their contributions to various fields:**

1. Dadasaheb Phalke Award
2. UNESCO's Prix Versailles Award
3. Bharat Ratna
4. Padma Awards

Which of the above awards are exclusively given to Indian citizens?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is India's highest film award, and the UNESCO Prix Versailles Award, while international, has recognized Indian projects. Padma Awards are also exclusively for Indian citizens.  However, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, has been conferred upon non-Indians in the past. This makes (b) the correct answer. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific eligibility criteria of each award, requiring detailed factual recall and the ability to differentiate between awards with similar prestige.


**3. Consider the following elements related to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  The annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
3.  A major naval expedition against the Pallava Empire.
4.  Conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.

How many of the above accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval activities under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chola Empire, under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, undertook significant naval expeditions.  Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly reflect these actions: the destruction of the Chera navy, the annexation of northern Sri Lanka, and the conquests in Southeast Asia. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Chola's primary naval conflicts were with the Chera and Srivijaya (Sailendra) empires, not the Pallavas. The incorrect statement about the Pallavas acts as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of Chola history and their enemies.


**4. Consider the following related to the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1. The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the Ramayana.
2. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
3. The MoW program was launched in 1997.
4. The program aims to preserve the world's documentary heritage.


How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The 10th MOWCAP meeting was indeed held in Ulaanbaatar, and the MoW program aims to preserve documentary heritage.  While the register does include Indian works, it specifically lists the *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, not the *Ramayana* directly (though the Ramcharitmanas is a retelling).  Statement 3 is incorrect; the MoW program began in 1992, not 1997. This makes (c) correct.  The subtle difference between the *Ramayana* and the *Ramcharitmanas* is a key distractor, demanding precise knowledge of the listed texts.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Bharat Ratna:**

1. It is awarded by the President of India for outstanding service in any field.
2. Recommendations for the award are made by the Vice President of India.
3. The award includes a monetary grant.
4.  The award can be conferred posthumously.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: the President confers the Bharat Ratna for exceptional service. Statement 4 is also correct: the posthumous conferral of the award is allowed. However, statement 2 is incorrect;  the Prime Minister makes the recommendations, not the Vice President.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Bharat Ratna does not come with a monetary grant.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The inclusion of the roles of the Prime Minister and Vice President, and the presence or absence of a monetary component, all serve as effective distractors.


**6. Consider the following about the  International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD):**

1. It commemorates Buddha's descent from Tāvatimsa-devaloka to Sankassiya.
2. It is observed by the Ministry of Culture in association with the International Yoga Confederation.
3. The event also celebrates Pali's declaration as a classical language.
4. Sankassiya is located in Bihar.


How many of the above statements correctly describe IAD?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. IAD commemorates Buddha's descent and celebrates Pali's classical language status. However, statement 2 is incorrect; it's the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), not the International Yoga Confederation.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur) is located in Uttar Pradesh, not Bihar.  The question's difficulty stems from the close similarity between the IBC and a plausible distractor, requiring precise recall of the organization's name. The location of Sankassiya also acts as a potent distractor.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Ancient Nalanda University:**

1. It was founded by Chandragupta I in the 5th century CE.
2. It was a monastic university with residential and educational buildings.
3.  Major disciplines included Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, and medicine.
4. Its library, "Dharma Gunj," held over nine million books.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Ancient Nalanda University?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Nalanda was a monastic university, offered various disciplines including the mentioned Buddhist traditions and medicine, and possessed a vast library. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it was founded by Kumargupta I, not Chandragupta I. The confusion between the Chandraguptas serves as a powerful distractor, requiring detailed recall of historical details.


**8. Consider the following initiatives to promote the sports ecosystem in India:**

1.  Khelo India program
2.  Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)
3.  National Sports Development Fund scheme
4.  One School-One Game policy

How many of the above are aimed at identifying and developing athletes at various levels?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Khelo India, TOPS, and the National Sports Development Fund are all focused on athlete identification and development, albeit at different stages and with varying approaches.  However, the "One School-One Sport" policy, while promoting sports, doesn't primarily focus on identifying and developing elite athletes.  The question tests knowledge of specific Indian sports development programs and their nuanced objectives, creating difficulty through subtle differences in program goals.


**9. Consider the following regarding Transhumance:**

1. It is the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.
2. Two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2022.
3. In India, it is prevalent in the Himalayas and plains like Rajasthan.
4. The practice is primarily associated with rearing cattle.

How many of the above statements accurately describe transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct descriptions of transhumance.  The practice involves seasonal movement, and it's prevalent in both Himalayan and plains regions of India. Statement 4 is partially correct; while cattle are involved, sheep and goats are also commonly reared. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the declaration was in 2023, not 2022.  The year and the specific animals reared serve as distractors, testing precise factual recall.


**10. Consider the following related to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and monument protection:**

1. The ASI intends to delist some "untraceable" centrally protected monuments.
2. Kos Minar No. 13 is among the monuments facing delisting.
3.  The decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Tourism.
4. Delisting means the monument will no longer receive ASI conservation.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the ASI's actions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The ASI is delisting monuments, Kos Minar No. 13 is involved, and delisting removes ASI conservation.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, not Tourism. The difference between the Ministries acts as a significant distractor, testing precise knowledge of governmental bodies involved in cultural preservation.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect Ratan Tata's accomplishments. He significantly expanded the Tata Group's revenue, launched the Tata Nano, and was a recipient of the Padma Vibhushan. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while Ratan Tata promoted a scientific temperament and was instrumental in supporting the IISC, he did not establish the institute.  The IISC was founded much earlier, in 1909, with inspiration from Swami Vivekananda's advocacy for scientific development in India.  The other options incorrectly include statement 4, making (a) the only accurate choice.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between contributions and influences.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe Swami Dayanand Saraswati's core philosophy: a return to Vedic principles and the authorship of "Satyarth Prakash."  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Ramakrishna Mission was founded by Swami Vivekananda, not Swami Dayanand Saraswati. Similarly, statement 4 is incorrect; while Swami Vivekananda inspired Jamsetji Tata,  Swami Dayanand Saraswati's direct involvement in the IISC's establishment is not historically documented. The question tests factual recall and understanding of distinct philosophical movements in India.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Bharat Ratna award:**

1.  It is India's highest civilian award, conferred for outstanding service in any field.
2.  Recommendations for the award are formally submitted by the President of India.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Bharat Ratna is the highest civilian award, and it doesn't include a monetary grant. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the Prime Minister makes recommendations, it’s not a formal process.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the award can be conferred posthumously (after death). This question tests factual knowledge about the Bharat Ratna and the nuances of its award process.  It also highlights the importance of knowing exceptions to general rules regarding awards.


**4. Consider the following regarding Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions:**

1.  He played a key role in planning the infrastructure of Mumbai (Bombay).
2.  He was a significant contributor to the development of the railways in India.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was instrumental in shaping Mumbai's urban development and was involved in early railway projects. Statement 3 is partially correct; he donated land that contributed to the eventual establishment of Elphinstone College, but he didn't found it directly. Statement 4 is incorrect; he was not known for authoring economic policy documents. The question tests the ability to discern direct contributions from indirect influences and involvement.  It demands precise knowledge of his role in key historical developments.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Memory of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake:**

1. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake had a magnitude of 7.9, the museum is located as stated, and it includes a large Miyawaki forest. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the museum was inaugurated in 2022, not 2001. The question tests factual knowledge about the earthquake and the memorial museum, highlighting the importance of accurate details in historical contexts. It also includes a distractor that plays on the proximity of the dates.


These questions demand a high level of factual recall and understanding of the nuanced details associated with each individual and event.  The distractor options are designed to test the candidate's ability to filter information accurately.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economic aspects and adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following aspects related to the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  Patronage of Marathi literature, including works by Moropant.
2.  Establishment of Maheshwar as a center of trade and commerce.
3.  Significant role in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.
4.  Promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry, a handicraft registered under Geographical Indications (GI).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the economic contributions or activities associated with the Holkar Dynasty?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's economic influence.  Moropant's literary patronage, while not directly economic, fostered a cultural environment that indirectly supported economic activity. Maheshwar's development as a trade and commerce hub demonstrates direct economic impact. The Holkars' participation in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, though a military conflict, had significant economic consequences, particularly concerning the subsequent treaties and territorial control. Finally, the promotion of the Maheswari weaving industry and its GI registration clearly showcases economic initiatives.  Therefore, all four statements contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the dynasty's economic role.


**2. Consider the following regarding the economic impact of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign:**

1.  Reconstruction of major temples like Kashi Vishvanath and Somnath.
2.  Mainstreaming of Bhil and Gond tribes and lower castes into economic activities.
3.  Patronage of Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram and Marathi poets.
4.  Development of Maheswar and Indore as significant trade centers.

Which of the above can be directly linked to the economic development and policies implemented during Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's rule?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While temple reconstruction (1) and literary patronage (3) enhanced cultural prestige, their direct economic impact is less pronounced compared to other actions.  The economic impact of social reforms (2), leading to the inclusion of marginalized communities in economic activities, is more substantial.  The development of Maheswar and Indore as trade centers (4) is a clear indicator of economic policy success. Therefore, options 2 and 4 represent the most direct and significant economic outcomes of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign.  Option (a), (c), and (d) include elements with less direct economic relevance.



**3. Consider the following statements about the economic aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Amara-Nayaka system, where military commanders managed territories and collected taxes.
2.  The Ayagar system, where functionaries were appointed by the government in each village.
3.  The "Amaram" and "Bhandaravada" lands held by the Amara-Nayakas.
4.  Extensive trade networks facilitated by the empire's strategic location and political stability.

How many of the above contributed to the economic structure and prosperity of the Vijayanagara Empire?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements describe significant aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's economic system. The Amara-Nayaka system (1) created a decentralized yet controlled tax collection mechanism. The Ayagar system (2) provided a village-level administrative structure influencing local economic activities. The land holdings (3) of the Amara-Nayakas demonstrate a land-based economic system. Finally, the empire's strategic position and stability (4) enabled extensive trade networks, which were crucial for economic prosperity.  Therefore, all four elements contributed to the economic strength of the Vijayanagara Empire.


**4. Consider the following about the economic activities of the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC):**

1.  Internal and foreign trade facilitated by standardized weights and measures.
2.  Exports of grain, jewelry, and pottery.
3.  Imports of thin copper and precious stones.
4.  The existence of a sophisticated urban planning system.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the economic characteristics of the IVC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While urban planning (4) contributed to economic organization, it's not a direct economic activity like trade.  The standardized weights and measures (1), export of goods (2), and import of resources (3) are all direct evidence of economic activity within the IVC. They indicate a complex system of trade and resource management, supporting a sophisticated economy. Therefore, three out of the four statements accurately represent the economic aspects of the IVC.


**5. Consider these aspects of Kozhikode's economic history:**

1.  Its location on the Malabar coast.
2.  Its role as a major spice trading center for centuries.
3.  The origin of the term "calico" being associated with its textile production.
4.  Its rule under the Samoothiris (Zamorins) during the medieval age.

How many of the above directly relate to the economic significance of Kozhikode?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The geographical location (1) on the Malabar coast was crucial for its trade activities.  The spice trade (2) was the foundation of its economic prosperity. The textile industry (3) and the origin of "calico" point to another significant economic activity. While the Samoothiris' rule (4) provided the political context, it is not a direct economic factor. Therefore, three of the statements directly relate to the economic significance of Kozhikode.  The political aspect, while influential, is not a direct economic activity.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission.
2.  The delivery of a renowned address at the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago.
3.  The promotion of a scientific temperament leading to the establishment of a prominent Indian scientific institution.
4.  The propagation of Vedanta philosophy, encompassing various schools of thought.

How many of the above are associated with the contributions and legacy of Swami Vivekananda?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Swami Vivekananda's multifaceted contributions significantly impacted religious discourse, philosophical thought, and the advancement of scientific education in India.  His address at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago catapulted Vedanta philosophy onto the global stage, showcasing Indian wisdom to the West.  His influence extended to promoting a scientific temperament, notably inspiring Jamsetji Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science (IISC). The Ramakrishna Mission, established in 1897, continues to serve as a testament to his commitment to social service and spiritual upliftment.  Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect facets of his extensive legacy. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the breadth and depth of Vivekananda's influence and contributions.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Authorship of "Satyartha Prakash," a seminal work advocating a return to Vedic principles.
2.  Leadership of a conservative faction within a significant socio-religious movement.
3.  Establishment of numerous educational institutions and orphanages across India.
4.  Preaching a Vedic ideology that denounced idolatry and ritualistic worship.

How many of the above accurately describe the contributions of Swami Dayanand Saraswati?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Swami Dayanand Saraswati's impact on Indian society is multifaceted.  His "Satyartha Prakash" remains a cornerstone of Arya Samaj philosophy, emphasizing a return to Vedic principles and denouncing idolatry. He actively established numerous educational institutions and orphanages, significantly impacting access to education. While he played a crucial role in the Arya Samaj movement,  he led the conservative faction, not a broader movement.  Therefore, three of the four statements correctly represent his key contributions. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes a detail that is not entirely accurate concerning his direct leadership of a specific faction within a broader movement. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete representations of his significant contributions.


**3. Consider the following statements related to the Holkar Dynasty:**

1.  The dynasty was a prominent member of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside other influential houses.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the Holkar Dynasty and its significant figures?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Holkar Dynasty played a pivotal role in Maratha history.  It was indeed part of the Maratha Confederacy, alongside other powerful houses like the Bhonsle and Gaekwad.  Malhar Rao II's participation in the Third Anglo-Maratha War led to the Treaty of Mandsaur, significantly shaping the dynasty's relationship with the British. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's reign saw the reconstruction of significant temples, showcasing her patronage of religious architecture.  Her rule also fostered economic prosperity, transforming Maheshwar into a thriving center of trade and commerce, particularly known for its Maheswari weaving industry.  All four statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Holkar Dynasty's history and the contributions of its notable rulers.


**4. Consider the following figures associated with the development of Mumbai:**

1.  Nana Jagannath Shankarseth, known for his contributions to urban planning and education.
2.  Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, a merchant and philanthropist who inspired many subsequent reformers.
3.  Dr. Bhau Daji Lad, whose contributions are linked to a prominent museum in Byculla.
4.  A prominent individual who played a key role in the early Indian railway project between Boribunder and Thane.

How many of the above individuals made significant contributions to the development of Mumbai?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The development of Mumbai involved numerous individuals. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth's contributions extended to urban planning, designing buildings, streets, and avenues, and to education, donating land for schools. Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy's philanthropic activities and business acumen significantly influenced subsequent generations of reformers. Dr. Bhau Daji Lad's association with the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Byculla signifies his contributions to preserving Mumbai's cultural heritage. Nana Jagannath Shankarseth was also a key member of the committee that spearheaded the early Indian railway project between Boribunder and Thane.  Therefore, all four figures played key roles in Mumbai's growth and development.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Bharat Ratna:**

1.  The award is granted by the President of India for outstanding service in any field.
2.  Recommendations for the award are formally submitted by a designated body to the President.
3.  Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion, but no monetary grant.
4.  The award can be conferred posthumously, although this wasn't initially the case.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Bharat Ratna award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award.  It is indeed granted by the President, recognizing exceptional contributions across various fields. The recipients receive a Sanad and a medallion, without any monetary component. While the Prime Minister makes recommendations to the President, there isn't a formal, designated body for submissions.  The posthumous conferring of the award is a later addition to the regulations.  Therefore, three of the four statements accurately describe the Bharat Ratna. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracy regarding formal recommendations.  Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect as they fail to fully represent the aspects of the Bharat Ratna.


**6. Consider the following related to the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme:**

1.  The programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three distinct registers.
2.  The International Register includes several Indian entries, such as ancient texts and manuscript collections.
3.  The programme's goals include preserving documentary heritage, ensuring universal access, and raising public awareness.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the MoW Programme and its recent developments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Programme aims to safeguard significant documentary heritage.  It was launched in 1992 and comprises international, regional, and national registers.  The International Register includes numerous Indian entries, reflecting the country's rich documentary heritage.  The programme's objectives encompass preservation, access, and public awareness of this heritage. The inclusion of the Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in a regional register highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve and promote important literary works. Therefore, all four statements accurately represent the MoW Programme and its recent activities.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Vijayanagara Empire's history is rich and complex. The Tuluva Dynasty marked a period of significant expansion and power. The Sangama Dynasty founded the empire, laying the groundwork for its subsequent growth. The empire's unique political system involved Amara-Nayakas, military commanders granted territories to rule.  Hampi, with its magnificent temples, stands as a testament to the empire's architectural achievements, a site recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.  Thus, all four statements correctly reflect key aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire.

2.  The event commemorates the death anniversary of a significant figure in Jainism.

How many of the above statements are true regarding the recent celebrations in Jainism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The recent celebrations in Jainism focused on Bhagwan Mahaveer, a central figure in Jain philosophy. The 2550th Nirvan Mahotsav commemorates his death anniversary, emphasizing his contributions to Jain thought and practice. While the event includes religious practices and rituals, it also has broader significance, highlighting Mahaveer's legacy and his impact on the Jain faith. Therefore, three statements correctly reflect the nature and significance of the celebrations. Option (d) is too narrow, overlooking the broader significance of the event. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect because they fail to fully capture the significance of the event.


**9.  Consider the following regarding the Chola Empire:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola I led significant naval expeditions, including conquests of Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia.
2.  The Chola Empire's naval power was crucial to its control over extensive maritime trade routes.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's history and achievements?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Chola Empire's maritime prowess and extensive trade networks are well-documented. Rajaraja Chola I's naval expeditions successfully expanded the empire's influence, encompassing conquests of Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. The Chola Empire's naval strength was instrumental in controlling vital maritime trade routes. Nagapattinam flourished as a major trading center, reflecting the empire's economic dominance.  Rajendra Chola I's reign further extended the empire's reach into the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Therefore, all four statements accurately depict key aspects of the Chola Empire's history and its significant achievements.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Arya Samaj:**

1.  It was the first Hindu organization to actively promote proselytization.
2.  Swami Shraddhanand led the radical wing of the Arya Samaj post-1892 split.
3.  A key principle emphasized the importance of ethical justifications for actions.
4.  The 1892 split was primarily caused by disagreements over dietary practices.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Arya Samaj, under Swami Dayanand Saraswati's leadership, was a pioneering Hindu organization that actively sought to convert individuals to Hinduism, a practice not common among traditional Hindu groups at the time.  This proactive approach to expanding its religious base distinguishes it from many other contemporary Hindu movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Swami Shraddhanand led the *conservative* wing of the Arya Samaj after the 1892 split. Lala Hansraj led the radical group. The split stemmed from differing views on the language of religious instruction and dietary practices, not necessarily ideological differences.

Statement 3 is correct. One of the core tenets of Arya Samaj philosophy emphasized the ethical basis of actions, advocating for a life guided by moral principles and rational thought. This emphasis on ethical conduct is a fundamental aspect of their teachings.

Statement 4 is partially correct. While disagreements over dietary practices were a contributing factor to the 1892 split, the dispute also centered on the language used for religious instruction and education within the Arya Samaj.  Therefore, stating it as the *primary* cause is an oversimplification.


**2. Consider the following features associated with Swami Vivekananda:**

1.  He was born in Kolkata.
2.  He delivered a renowned address at the World's Parliament of Religions in London.
3.  His birth anniversary is celebrated as National Youth Day in India.
4.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897.
5.  Sister Nivedita was among his prominent disciples.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) All five (d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are factually accurate. Swami Vivekananda was indeed born in Kolkata (then Calcutta), his birth anniversary is observed as National Youth Day, he founded the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, and Margaret Noble (Sister Nivedita) was one of his most significant disciples.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Swami Vivekananda's famous address was delivered at the World's Parliament of Religions in *Chicago*, not London, in 1893. This speech significantly boosted the global awareness of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism.  The error in the location makes this statement false.


**3. Consider the following regarding Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1.  She was born in the village of Chondi, Pune.
2.  She became the ruler of Malwa after the death of her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar.
3.  She significantly patronized the arts, including Sanskrit scholar Khushali Ram.
4.  She is known for the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple in Gujarat.
5.  Her husband was killed in the Battle of Panipat.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two (b) Only three (c) Only four (d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Ahilyabai Holkar ascended to power in Malwa following the deaths of her husband and father-in-law.  She was a renowned patron of arts and learning, supporting figures like Khushali Ram.  Her contributions to the reconstruction of the Somnath Temple are well-documented.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While she was born in Ahmednagar district, the village is Chondi, not Pune.  This slight inaccuracy makes the statement false.

Statement 5 is incorrect. Her husband, Khanderao Holkar, was killed in the Battle of Kumbher, not Panipat.  The battle in which her husband died is a key detail often overlooked.


**4. Consider the following about the Sangameshwar Temple:**

1. It is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is situated at the confluence of the Krishna River and several tributaries, including the Bhavani. The temple's annual submersion due to the Srisailam dam's backwaters is a well-known feature.  The existence of other Sangameshwar temples in Telangana and Tamil Nadu further supports this.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu. This is a crucial distinction in Hindu theology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly menstruation of Goddess Kamakhya, not her birth. This annual festival is linked to the goddess's fertility and creative energy. The subtle but significant difference between birth and menstruation makes this statement false.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Jyotirmath is located in the Chamoli district, not Nainital district, of Uttarakhand. This is a simple geographical error.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The temple is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, a form of Shiva, not Vishnu. The deity to whom the temple is dedicated is a key distinguishing feature.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Inscriptions suggest the earliest shrine was built much earlier, in 740 CE, under the Chalukyas.  The date of construction is a crucial piece of historical information.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, indeed empowers the Central Government to delist monuments deemed to have ceased to be of national importance.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The Natamandapa is described as an audience or dancing hall, not a residential area for priests.  This statement misrepresents the function of this architectural component.

Statement 4 is correct: The passage correctly attributes the temple's construction to Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, the founder of the Ganga dynasty in the 12th century.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.

Statement 2 is correct: K. Kelappan, known as the "Kerala Gandhi," is rightly identified as a prominent figure and leader in the Vaikom Satyagraha movement.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The Vaikom Satyagraha's primary focus was on temple entry, not voting rights.  While broader social justice concerns were involved, the core issue was access to religious spaces.

Statement 4 is correct: The passage correctly states that T.K. Madhavan initially raised the issue of temple entry restrictions in a 1917 editorial in his newspaper, Deshabhimani, laying the groundwork for the later movement. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is the highest honor, not awarded annually to several writers; it is reserved for a select few.  The wording implies a frequency that is not accurate.

Statement 3 is correct: The text describes the Fellowship as the highest honor conferred by the Akademi.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 and are among India's highest civilian honors.  While normally not conferred posthumously, the government may make exceptions in highly deserving cases.  The awards are categorized into Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, recognizing exceptional and distinguished service across various disciplines. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The Padma Awards do *not* constitute titles; recipients cannot use them as prefixes or suffixes to their names. This is a crucial detail often overlooked, highlighting the difference between an award and a formal title.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

Statement 1 is incorrect because the awarding body is the Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare, not the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, although both are related. Statement 4 is incorrect as the provided text does not specify the awarding frequency or date.  The text only mentions a 7th Anubhav Awards Ceremony. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

(b) Only two

Statement 2 is incorrect; delisting removes ASI protection and maintenance.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the AMASR Act does not use the term "Missing Monuments," as noted in the text.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are partially correct.

Statement 3 is also incorrect; while Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement, he didn't actively participate throughout its duration. Therefore, only two statements are partially correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Asiatic Land Tenure Act of 1946, which restricted Indian land ownership, played a significant role in bringing the issue of apartheid to the UN. India was indeed the first country to sever trade relations with the apartheid government in 1946, which is a form of economic sanction. Mahatma Gandhi's early anti-colonial and anti-racial discrimination activism in South Africa significantly influenced the subsequent anti-apartheid movement. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Apartheid system was imposed by White Europeans on Black Africans, Coloureds, and Indians. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

2.  They are administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.  The National Film Awards were initially called "State Awards." The awards are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. They are given in three categories (Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema). The "Most Film Friendly State" award is presented along with the National Film Awards.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The blindfold on the Lady Justice statue symbolizes impartiality in judgment. The concept of Lady Justice originates in Greek and Roman mythology (Justitia). The scales represent fairness in weighing evidence, and the sword symbolizes the power of justice. Statement 4 is incorrect; the addition of the blindfold occurred later during the Renaissance as a commentary on corrupt legal systems, not a common feature of ancient Greek sculptures. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prime Minister, not the Vice President, makes recommendations to the President.

Statement 3 is incorrect; initially, it was not conferred posthumously, but this changed in 1966.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at being "difficult" by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  Rajendra I's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province.
3.  The Chola Empire's naval expeditions extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
4.  Nagapattinam served as a key trading center for the Chola Empire's maritime activities.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval power and reach?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate reflections of the Chola Empire's maritime capabilities and extent. Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola naval power, culminating in victories like the one at Kandalursalai. Rajendra I continued this expansion, conquering Sri Lanka and even reaching Southeast Asia, including the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Nagapattinam played a crucial role as a major port facilitating the Empire's extensive trade network.  The options are designed to be challenging; for example, one might incorrectly assume only Rajendra I was responsible for significant naval expansion.


**2. Consider the following features associated with the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  Use of standardized weights and measures in internal and foreign trade.
2.  Extensive use of iron tools and weaponry.
3.  Development of a fully deciphered pictographic writing system.
4.  Construction of sophisticated urban planning, including grid patterns and drainage systems.

How many of the above features accurately characterize the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect features of the Indus Valley Civilization.  The civilization did indeed utilize standardized weights and measures, reflecting a sophisticated approach to trade.  Their urban planning, with grid patterns and advanced drainage systems, is also well-documented. However, the Indus Valley Civilization did *not* use iron extensively (statement 2 is incorrect, bronze was primary), and their writing system remains undeciphered (statement 3 is incorrect).  The options are designed to test knowledge of specific details and to distinguish between commonly known and less well-known aspects of the civilization.


**3. Consider the following elements related to Transhumance:**

1.  It is a traditional practice primarily focused on the seasonal migration of agricultural crops.
2.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland is an example of this practice recognized by UNESCO.
3.  In India, it is primarily practiced by nomadic tribes in the Himalayan region.
4.  The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) leads a global initiative on this practice.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the practice of Transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of transhumance.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland's recognition by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage highlights the practice's global significance.  The Himalayan nomadic tribes' reliance on seasonal livestock movement exemplifies transhumance in India. ICOMOS's leadership in a related initiative further underscores its importance. However, transhumance is not about the migration of crops (statement 1 is incorrect); it is about the seasonal movement of livestock and the human communities that depend on them.  This question tests knowledge of a less commonly discussed topic, requiring both factual recall and understanding of the core concept.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty marked the empire's zenith, characterized by significant territorial expansion.
2.  The empire's political structure included Amara-Nayakas, who were military commanders given territories to rule.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements correctly represent various facets of the Vijayanagara Empire.  While the Tuluva Dynasty, not the Sangama, is considered the empire's zenith, the Sangama Dynasty was foundational. The Amara-Nayaka system was a critical element of the empire's decentralized governance. Krishnadevaraya's reign indeed involved the significant territorial gains mentioned. The Virupaksha Temple stands as a testament to the empire's architectural achievements. The distractor in statement 1 is designed to challenge the candidate's precise knowledge of the empire's dynastic history.


**5. Consider the following about the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal:**

1. It is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Tourism.
2. Lothal is a prominent city of the Indus Valley Civilization known for its man-made dry dock.
3. The NMHC aims to showcase India's maritime heritage from ancient times to the present.
4.  Key projects include a world-class Lighthouse Museum and coastal state pavilions.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the NMHC at Lothal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Lothal's significance in the Indus Valley Civilization and its dry dock are well-established. The NMHC's aim and its proposed features are accurately described. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, not the Ministry of Tourism, is responsible for its development under the Sagarmala Programme. This question tests knowledge of a specific project and its associated details, requiring precise recall of the involved ministries and project features.  The distractor in statement 1 plays on the general association of heritage sites with the tourism ministry.



**6. Consider the following related to the Harappan Civilization:**

1.  The civilization primarily used iron tools and weaponry.
2.  The "Dancing Girl" bronze statue exemplifies their bronze casting skills using the "lost wax" technique.
3.  Their religion involved the worship of a male deity, Pasupati (proto-Shiva), and a female deity, the Mother Goddess.
4.  Mesopotamian records refer to the Indus region as Meluha, mentioning Dilmun and Makan as trading stations.


How many of the statements above are accurate representations of the Harappan Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe aspects of the Harappan Civilization. The "Dancing Girl" statue is a prime example of their bronze casting, using the "lost wax" technique.  Their religious practices involved both male and female deities, as mentioned.  Mesopotamian records do indeed refer to the Indus region using the names provided, along with the intermediary trading stations.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Harappan civilization primarily used bronze, not iron, for tools and weapons. This question tests knowledge of specific artifacts, religious practices, and trade connections of the civilization, requiring detailed recall.


**7. Consider the following concerning the International Yoga Day:**

1.  It is celebrated annually on the summer solstice, June 21st.
2.  The United Nations proclaimed it in 2015, at the behest of India.
3.  Yoga's origins can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization, as evidenced by seals and fossil remains.
4.  Patanjali's Yogasutra, written in the 2nd century BC, provides a systematic reference to yoga.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding International Yoga Day and Yoga's history?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. International Yoga Day is celebrated on the summer solstice, Yoga's early presence is suggested by evidence from the Indus Valley Civilization, and Patanjali's Yogasutra is a significant early text on yoga. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the UN proclaimed International Yoga Day in 2014, not 2015. This question tests knowledge of both the modern observance of International Yoga Day and the historical context of yoga, demanding precise factual recall about the UN resolution and the dating of key historical events.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Flag Code of India:**

1. The Flag Code of India, 2002, governs the display of the National Flag only by government institutions.
2.  Amendments in 2021 allowed for machine-made flags made from polyester and cotton.
3.  The National Flag's length-to-height ratio must be 3:2.
4.  Private citizens may display the National Flag only on designated national holidays.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Flag Code of India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The amendments to the Flag Code did indeed allow for machine-made flags using specified materials. The length-to-height ratio is correctly stated.  Private individuals *can* display the flag at any time, correcting the misconception in statement 4.  Statement 1 is incorrect because it limits the scope of the Flag Code to only government institutions, while the code applies to private individuals and organizations as well. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Flag Code, including its amendments and the regulations governing private display of the National Flag.


**9. Consider the following concerning the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The register includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2.  The MOW Programme was launched in 1997.
3.  The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
4. The MOW Programme maintains only an International Register.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of UNESCO's MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The inclusion of the specified Indian literary works, the location of the MOWCAP meeting, and the existence of the regional register are accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the MOW Programme was launched in 1992, not 1997. This question tests knowledge of a specific UNESCO initiative and its details, requiring precise recall of the launch year and the composition of the register.  The distractor in statement 2 is designed to challenge the examinee's exact knowledge of the program's launch date.


**10. Consider the following regarding Neolithic Age rock carvings:**

1.  The Archaeological Survey of India has confirmed Neolithic age rock carvings in Goa's Mauxi village.
2.  The carvings were found etched into granite rocks along the Zarme riverbed.
3.  The discoveries are significant for understanding prehistoric art and culture in the region.
4.  The carvings depict primarily scenes of agricultural practices and early settlements.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the recent discovery of Neolithic age rock carvings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The ASI's confirmation of the carvings and their significance for understanding prehistoric culture are accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the carvings were found etched into *meta basalt* rocks, not granite.  While statement 4 might seem plausible, the specific subject matter of the carvings is not explicitly mentioned in the source text, making it a potentially misleading distractor. This question tests knowledge of a specific archaeological discovery, requiring attention to detail and the ability to distinguish between factual information and plausible inferences.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may touch upon multiple aspects of history, architecture, and culture.


**1. Consider the following dynasties associated with the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. Sangama Dynasty
2. Saluva Dynasty
3. Tuluva Dynasty
4. Hoysala Dynasty

How many of the above dynasties directly ruled the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Sangama, Saluva, and Tuluva dynasties all directly ruled the Vijayanagara Empire during different periods.  The Hoysala dynasty, while a powerful kingdom in South India, was a separate entity and did not directly rule the Vijayanagara Empire.  Understanding the chronological order and distinct identities of these dynasties is crucial for accurate identification. Option (c) correctly identifies the three dynasties that held direct power within the Vijayanagara Empire's political structure.


**2. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire's administration:**

1.  The use of  'Amaram' and 'Bhandaravada' land designations.
2.  The appointment of Amara-Nayakas as military commanders and regional rulers.
3.  The implementation of a centralized tax system with uniform rates across all regions.
4.  The establishment of a sophisticated postal service connecting major cities.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's administrative system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Vijayanagara Empire utilized the 'Amaram' and 'Bhandaravada' system for land management, and the Amara-Nayakas played a significant role in its decentralized governance structure. However, the empire didn't have a fully centralized tax system with uniform rates. The tax collection was often delegated to regional authorities, leading to variations in rates across different areas.  A sophisticated postal system also wasn't a defining feature of its administration in comparison to other aspects. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe facets of the Vijayanagara administrative system.


**3. Consider the following literary works associated with the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. *Amuktamalyada*
2. *Jambavati Kalyanam*
3. *Gita Govinda*
4. *Kiratarjuneeyam*

How many of the above works were authored or patronized during the reign of Krishnadevaraya?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** *Amuktamalyada* and *Jambavati Kalyanam* are explicitly linked to Krishnadevaraya's patronage or authorship.  The *Gita Govinda* and *Kiratarjuneeyam* are significant works of Sanskrit literature, but their connection to the Vijayanagara Empire, particularly Krishnadevaraya's reign, is not as direct or well-established as the other two.  Therefore, only two of the listed works are definitively associated with Krishnadevaraya's period.


**4. Consider the following aspects of the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1.  Conquests in the Maldives.
2.  Destruction of the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
3.  Naval expeditions reaching as far as Sumatra.
4.  Establishment of a permanent naval base in East Africa.

How many of the above accurately describe aspects of the Chola Empire's naval activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Chola Empire's naval power extended to the Maldives and Sumatra, as evidenced by historical records of their campaigns.  They also engaged in naval conflicts, with the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai being a notable event.  However, there's no strong historical evidence to support the establishment of a permanent Chola naval base in East Africa. Therefore, only three of the provided statements accurately reflect the scope of Chola naval activities.



**5. Consider the following features of the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  Extensive use of iron tools and weaponry.
2.  A well-developed system of writing using cuneiform script.
3.  The presence of standardized weights and measures.
4.  Evidence of sophisticated urban planning with grid layouts.

How many of the features listed above are accurately associated with the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Indus Valley Civilization is known for its advanced urban planning, evident in the grid patterns of cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.  They also utilized standardized weights and measures for trade and commerce.  However, iron was not widely used during their period; their technology primarily relied on bronze and copper.  Their writing system, while present, is not yet fully deciphered and is not cuneiform.  Therefore, only two of the listed features are correctly associated with the Indus Valley Civilization.


**6. Consider the following elements related to the Abhidhamma Day:**

1.  Commemorates the descent of Lord Buddha from the Trayastrimsa heaven.
2.  Marks the end of the first Buddhist council.
3.  Is associated with the Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankisa.
4.  Is celebrated primarily in Theravada Buddhist traditions.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the International Abhidhamma Day?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The International Abhidhamma Day commemorates Buddha's descent from the Trayastrimsa heaven (Tāvatimsa-devaloka in the provided text) to Sankisa, marked by the Asokan Elephant Pillar.  While the day holds significance across various Buddhist traditions, it's not exclusively associated with Theravada Buddhism. The first Buddhist council is a separate event. Therefore, three of the statements accurately reflect the significance of Abhidhamma Day.



**7. Consider the following about the Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  It includes manuscripts of three Indian literary works: Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2.  It is a UNESCO program launched in 2002.
3.  The 10th meeting of the MoWCAP was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
4.  The register aims to preserve and promote the world's documentary heritage.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.  The MoW program was, in fact, launched in 1992, not 2002, making statement 2 incorrect.  The other three statements accurately reflect the program's goals, the specific inclusion of Indian works, and the location of the tenth MoWCAP meeting.


**8. Consider the following about Transhumance:**

1.  It is a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement by nomadic pastoralists.
2.  It is primarily practiced in the Himalayan region of India.
3.  It was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2022.
4.  It involves the migration of human communities along with their herds.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of Transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the nature of Transhumance. While Transhumance is a significant practice in the Himalayas, it also exists in other parts of India. The 2023 declaration by UNESCO is also mentioned.  Statement 3 is incorrect about the year of declaration.  Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.



**9. Consider these locations associated with  prehistoric rock art in India:**

1. Bhimbetka (Madhya Pradesh)
2. Jwalapuram (Andhra Pradesh)
3.  Ajanta Caves (Maharashtra)
4.  Pachmarhi and Adamgarh Hills (Madhya Pradesh)

How many of the above locations are known for significant prehistoric rock paintings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Bhimbetka, Jwalapuram, and Pachmarhi/Adamgarh Hills are all mentioned in the text as sites containing significant prehistoric rock paintings. Ajanta Caves, while renowned for their Buddhist cave paintings, are not primarily associated with prehistoric rock art of the Paleolithic or Mesolithic periods.  Therefore, only three of the listed locations are known for significant prehistoric rock paintings.


**10. Consider the following about the Sangameshwar Temple:**

1. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
2. It is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers.
3. It is annually submerged due to flooding from the Srisailam dam.
4. It was built by the Chalukya dynasty.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, is annually submerged due to flooding, and was built by the Chalukya dynasty.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the text specifies the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavansi rivers, along with other tributaries. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following features related to prehistoric rock paintings in India:**

1.  Linear representations of animals like bison and elephants.
2.  Predominance of human scenes depicting hunting and community dances.
3.  Use of white and red pigments made from haematite and limestone.
4.  Naturalistic depiction of animals and stylistic representation of humans.

Which of the above features are characteristic of the Mesolithic Period rock paintings in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Mesolithic period in India is characterized by a larger number of paintings compared to other periods.  A key feature is the prominence of human figures in scenes depicting group hunting and community dances, indicating a shift in focus from solely animal representations. Animals are depicted naturalistically, while human figures are rendered in a more stylistic manner. Option (a) correctly reflects these characteristics. Option (b) omits the linear animal representations typical of the early stages within the Mesolithic period. Option (c) incorrectly includes the use of white and red pigments which are more associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period. Option (d) only includes features present in both the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, therefore failing to pinpoint the Mesolithic period.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty marked the empire's zenith.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab.
3.  Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors with limited military responsibilities.
4.  The empire's architectural marvels include the Virupaksha and Vithala Temples.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct:  Krishnadevaraya's reign significantly expanded the empire's territory, including the acquisition of the Raichur doab. Statement 4 is correct: The Virupaksha and Vithala Temples at Hampi are renowned examples of Vijayanagara architecture. Statement 1 is incorrect: The Tuluva dynasty, not the Sangama dynasty, is associated with the empire's peak. Statement 3 is partially incorrect: Amara-Nayakas were indeed military commanders, but their responsibilities extended beyond mere tax collection; they also controlled significant territories and held considerable power.  Therefore, only three statements (2, 4, and, to a lesser extent, 3) are factually accurate.


**3. Consider the following elements related to the Sangameshwar Temple:**

1.  Located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavani rivers.
2.  Dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
3.  Annually submerged due to flooding from the Srisailam dam.
4.  Built by the Kakatiya dynasty.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate: The Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal is known for its annual submersion due to the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.  Statement 1 is partially correct; while it is located on a river confluence, it's the Krishna River and five other tributaries, not just the Bhavani.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Vishnu. Statement 4 is incorrect; the temple was built by the Chalukya dynasty. Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the facts about the Nandyal Sangameshwar Temple.


**4. Consider the following aspects of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement:**

1.  Allows visa-free travel for Indian Sikhs only.
2.  Pakistan levies a fee on each pilgrim.
3.  The agreement has an indefinite validity period.
4.  The corridor grants access to Dera Baba Nanak in India for Pakistani Sikhs without Indian visas.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the terms of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor agreement?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate: Pakistan does levy a fee on each pilgrim using the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor. Statement 1 is incorrect because the agreement allows visa-free travel for both Indian pilgrims and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders, not just Sikhs. Statement 3 is incorrect; the initial agreement had a 5-year validity. Statement 4 is incorrect; Pakistani Sikhs still require an Indian visa to visit Dera Baba Nanak. Therefore, only statement 2 correctly describes the agreement.


**5. Consider the following features associated with the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal:**

1.  Developed under the Sagarmala Programme.
2.  Showcases India's maritime heritage from the Gupta period onwards.

4.  Located near the confluence of the Narmada and Tapti rivers.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NMHC at Lothal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct: The NMHC at Lothal is developed under the Sagarmala Programme and includes a lighthouse museum and coastal state pavilions as key projects. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while it showcases India's maritime heritage, it encompasses a much broader timeframe than just the Gupta period, going back to the Indus Valley Civilization. Statement 4 is incorrect; Lothal is situated between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers, not the Narmada and Tapti. Thus, only three statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative, not solely a Ministry of Textiles endeavor, making statement 1 incorrect.  Statement 2 is correct; blockchain technology is indeed used for traceability. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Cotton Corporation of India is a key partner. Statement 4 is correct; TEXPROCIL is the implementing agency. Statement 5 is incorrect; the initiative's aim is to enhance global competitiveness and create a sustainable ecosystem, not to reduce production costs. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are correct.

Statement 3 is correct; the project involves various art forms including paintings, murals, and sculptures. Statement 4 is also correct; Thangka painting is explicitly mentioned as an included art form. Statement 5 is incorrect; it's a Ministry of Culture initiative, not a collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism.  Therefore, only three statements (3, 4, and 5) are correct.

(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the initiative covers 50 tourist destinations.  Statement 2 is incorrect; it's launched by the Ministry of Tourism, not Culture. Statement 3 is correct; responsible tourism is a core component. Statement 4 is incorrect; while training is likely involved, the scope is broader than just guide training. Statement 5 is correct; the initiative explicitly involves "Paryatan Didi," suggesting the engagement of local women. Therefore, only statements 3 and 5 are correct.


**4. Consider the following about the Kashi Culture Pathway and the fight against illicit trafficking:**

1. The G20 endorsed a global coalition specifically for the Kashi Culture Pathway.
2. Section 3 of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, allows the export of antiquities under certain conditions.
3. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is responsible for the coordination and recovery of traced antiquities.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; while the G20 endorsed a global coalition to fight illicit trafficking, it wasn't solely for the Kashi Culture Pathway. Statement 2 is incorrect; Section 3 prevents, not allows, the export of antiquities. Statement 3 is correct; the ASI plays this crucial role. Statement 4 is incorrect; the focus is on antiquities, not textiles. Statement 5 is incorrect; there's no mention of UNESCO collaboration in this context. Therefore, only one statement (3) is fully correct.



**5. Consider the following statements about International Yoga Day (IYD):**

1. IYD is celebrated on the Winter Solstice.
2. India proposed the resolution to the UN for IYD.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; IYD is celebrated on the Summer Solstice. Statement 2 is correct; India proposed the resolution. Statement 3 is correct; yoga is indeed one of the six schools. Statement 4 is incorrect; the root is "yuj," meaning "to join," not "yog" meaning "to unite". Statement 5 is incorrect; systematic references are found in Patanjali's Yogasutra, not the Rigveda. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act's focus is broader than just manuscripts. Statement 2 is incorrect; the power to declare national importance lies with the Central Government, not state governments. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NMA was established later, by an amendment to the Act. Statement 4 is correct; the ASI has this responsibility. Statement 5 is correct; the NMA's functions include managing these areas. Therefore, only three statements (4, and 5) are correct.

Statement 4 is correct:  Vivekananda's meeting with Jamsetji Tata in 1893 played a significant role in inspiring Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science.

3. The Chola navy's conquest of Sri Lanka resulted in the entire island becoming a Chola province under Rajendra I.
4.  Nagapattinam served as a significant naval base for the Cholas.

How many of these statements accurately reflect Chola naval history?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate reflections of Chola naval history.  Rajaraja I did defeat the Chera navy (not Pandya) at Kandalursalai. Rajendra I's naval expeditions successfully reached and conquered regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  His conquest of Sri Lanka did lead to the island's incorporation as a Chola province.  Nagapattinam was indeed a crucial naval trading center and base for the Chola empire. Therefore, all four statements are correct.

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the Tāvatimsa-devaloka, not his enlightenment. Statement 2 is correct. The Asokan pillar at Sankassiya marks the location of this event. Statement 3 is correct. IAD coincides with the end of Vassa and the Pavāraṇā festival. Statement 4 is incorrect.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Abhaya mudra symbolizes fearlessness, not compassion. Statement 2 is correct. Amoghasiddhi is associated with this mudra. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bhumisparsha mudra signifies calling the earth to witness, not the preaching of Dhamma (that's Dharmachakrapravartana). Statement 4 is correct. Dhyana mudra indeed represents mental balance and tranquility. Therefore, three statements accurately describe Buddhist mudras.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the CPA's purpose and context?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CPA aims to prevent illicit trafficking and facilitate repatriation of Indian antiquities. Statement 2 is incorrect. The agreement focuses on preventing the flow *from* India *to* the USA, not the other way around. Statement 3 is correct. Article 9 of the 1970 UNESCO Convention provides the international framework for combating illicit trafficking, which the CPA supports. Statement 4 is incorrect. While both address illicit trafficking, the Kashi Culture Pathway is a separate, broader initiative, not directly involved in the CPA's implementation. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the architectural style is ancient, it’s not strictly Dravidian. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Evidence points to the Iron Age, not the Bronze Age. Statement 3 is correct.  A Kadamba inscription is a key historical marker for the site. Statement 4 is incorrect. It is in Chitradurga, not Bellary.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding.  The questions are designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements about megalithic burial practices in India:**

1. Dolmenoid cists are a type of chamber tomb, typically semi-subterranean.
2.  Urn burials are associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, as evidenced by the site of Inamgaon in Maharashtra.
3.  The Harappan civilization practiced coffin burials, with bodies often oriented north-south.
4.  Megalithic burials always show an association with iron tools and weaponry.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of semi-subterranean chamber tomb found in various megalithic sites across India. Inamgaon, a Chalcolithic site in Maharashtra, provides evidence of urn burials, typical of the period. The Harappan civilization also exhibited burial practices involving coffins and a specific body orientation.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While many megalithic sites show an association with iron, it's not a universal characteristic.  Some megalithic traditions predate the widespread use of iron. The presence of iron is more indicative of the later phases of the megalithic period.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Buddhist sites in India:**

1. Salihundam is significant for the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra and other eastern countries.
2. Bavikonda Monastery, near Visakhapatnam, is a Theravada Buddhist complex dating back to the 3rd century BCE.
3. Phanigiri, in Telangana, is known for its Mahastupa and Chaitya Grihas, showcasing the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana sects.
4.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha are exclusively associated with Hinayana Buddhism.

Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate descriptions of the respective Buddhist sites. Salihundam's role in the eastward spread of Buddhism is well-documented. Bavikonda's Theravada affiliation and its age are also established facts. Phanigiri's archaeological evidence supports the coexistence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist traditions. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were initially associated with Jain monks, later additions and influences suggest a more complex religious landscape than solely Hinayana Buddhism.


**3. Consider the following features of Ahom Moidams:**

1.  They are topped by a central shrine known as Chou Cha Li.
2.  They always include a brick-and-stone vault (Tak) containing a grave-pit (Garvha).
3.  They are protected by special officers called Moidam Phukans.
4.  Pre-17th century Ahom burial practices invariably involved cremation and the burial of ashes.

Which of the above are characteristic features of Ahom Moidams?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe features of Ahom Moidams. The Chou Cha Li shrine atop the earthen mound (Ga-Moidam) is a key element. The presence of a brick-and-stone vault (Tak) with a grave-pit (Garvha) is also typical. Moidam Phukans served as protectors of these sites. However, statement 4 is inaccurate.  While cremation became more common later, pre-17th-century Ahom burial practices also included embalming and entombment.


**4. Consider the following statements about religious sites in India:**

1. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2. The Kamakhya Temple in Assam showcases a blend of Nilachal, Pala, and Ahom architectural styles.
3. The Kedarnath Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva and is part of the Char Dham circuit.
4.  Jyotirmath, in Uttarakhand, is associated with the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Adi Shankaracharya and serves as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath.

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct.  While Sangameswar temples are primarily associated with Lord Shiva (not Vishnu), the statement accurately describes the location and annual submergence of the Nandyal temple.  The Kamakhya Temple's architectural synthesis is well-documented. The Kedarnath Temple's status as a Jyotirlinga and its place in the Char Dham circuit are widely known.  Jyotirmath's links to Adi Shankaracharya, Advaita Vedanta, and its function as the winter abode of Lord Badrinath are also accurate.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Indus Valley Civilization's standardized weights and measures point to a well-organized trade network.  The worship of Pasupati (proto-Shiva) and a Mother Goddess is evidenced through archaeological finds. Lothal's urban planning and the discovery of a dry dock are significant aspects of the civilization. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Indus script remains undeciphered to this day, despite efforts to decode it.  The boustrophedon style of writing is correct, but the meaning of the script itself remains a mystery.


**1. Consider the following figures associated with the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  The year the Travancore Congress Committee launched a campaign to lift the ban on temple entry.
2.  The year the Kerala Provincial Congress Committee passed a resolution on anti-untouchability.

The Kerala Provincial Congress Committee's resolution on anti-untouchability was passed in the 1923 Kakinada session of the INC (2 is correct). The Vaikom Satyagraha lasted 604 days (3 is correct). The Temple Entry Proclamation, a landmark legal victory, was enacted in 1936 (4 is correct). Therefore, three out of the four figures are correctly stated. Option (a) is incorrect as more than one figure is correctly stated. Option (b) is incorrect because three figures are correctly stated, not just two. Option (d) is incorrect because not all four figures are correctly stated in the provided context.

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jyotirao Phule led the Satyashodhak Movement (1 is correct). E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) was a key figure in the Vaikom Satyagraha and received rigorous imprisonment (2 is correct).  E.V. Ramasamy Naicker also founded the Self-Respect Movement (3 is correct).  Dr. T.M. Nair, P. Tyagaraja Chetti, and C.N. Mudaliar were leaders of the Justice Party Movement (4 is correct).  Therefore, all three individuals (1, 3, and 4) are correctly paired with their respective movements. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the Justice Party leader. Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly pairs a Vaikom Satyagraha figure with the Justice Party. Option (d) omits the Justice Party leader, making it also incorrect.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Kakori Train Action:**

1.  It was executed by members of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
2.  The primary objective was to fund revolutionary activities.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the Kakori Train Action?

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Kakori Train Action was indeed executed by members of the HRA (1 is correct), and its primary objective was to obtain funds for revolutionary activities (2 is correct). However, the action took place near Kakori, not Kanpur, in Uttar Pradesh (3 is incorrect). Bhagat Singh was not involved in the Kakori Train Action; he was involved in later revolutionary activities (4 is incorrect). Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Kakori Train Action. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they overstate or understate the number of accurate statements.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Apartheid system was a system of racial segregation imposed by White Europeans on Non-whites (Black Africans, Coloured and Indians) (1 is incorrect).  It was officially institutionalized in 1948 (2 is correct).  Pass laws, which restricted the movement of Black Africans, existed before the formalization of apartheid and served as precursors (3 is correct). The Anti-Apartheid Movement employed both internal and external campaigns (4 is incorrect). Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect aspects of the Apartheid system. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in their descriptions of the Apartheid system.

Thomas Edward Ravenshaw was the Commissioner of the Odisha division during the famine (3 is correct). The Puri Canal was built after the famine (4 is correct).  Therefore, three statements accurately describe the Odisha Famine. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either understate or overstate the number of accurate statements.

The 21 Sikh soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross (4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Battle of Saragarhi.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either overstate or understate the number of accurate statements.

1.  It aims to prevent illicit trafficking of antiquities.
2.  It restricts the import of certain Indian antiquities into the US.
3.  It was signed at the 45th World Heritage Committee meeting.
4.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is not involved in its implementation.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the India-US Cultural Property Agreement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CPA does aim to prevent illicit trafficking of antiquities between India and the US (1 is correct).  It restricts the importation into the United States of certain archaeological and ethnological material of Indian origin (2 is correct).  The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the 46th, not the 45th, World Heritage Committee meeting (3 is incorrect). The ASI is involved in the repatriation of antiquities (4 is incorrect). Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the CPA. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in their descriptions of the agreement.


**14. Consider the following about the International Yoga Day:**

1.  It is celebrated annually on June 21st.
2.  The UN proclaimed it in response to a proposal from China.
3.  Yoga is considered one of the six schools of Indian philosophy.
4.  The word "Yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root meaning "to unite."


How many of the above statements accurately describe International Yoga Day and related concepts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

International Yoga Day is celebrated annually on June 21st (1 is correct). The UN proclaimed it in response to a proposal from India, not China (2 is incorrect). Yoga is indeed one of the six schools of Indian philosophy (3 is correct). The word "Yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning "to join" or "to unite" (4 is correct). Therefore, three statements accurately describe International Yoga Day and yoga's origins. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in their descriptions.


**15. Consider the following regarding India's performance in the Olympic Games:**

1.  India's Olympic ranking improved from the Tokyo 2020 games to the Paris 2024 games.
2.  India won more medals in Paris 2024 than in Tokyo 2020.
3.  India's performance in Paris 2024 was its best Olympic performance to date.
4.  Breaking, sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing were new sports introduced in Paris 2024.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's Olympic performance and the Paris 2024 Games?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India's Olympic ranking fell from 48th in Tokyo to 71st in Paris (1 is incorrect). India won fewer medals in Paris (six) than in Tokyo (seven) (2 is incorrect).  Paris 2024 was India's third-best Olympic performance, not its best (3 is incorrect).  Breaking, sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing were indeed new sports in Paris 2024 (4 is correct). Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects India's Olympic performance and the Paris 2024 Games. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they overstate the number of accurate statements.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding megalithic structures:**

1. Dolmenoid cists are semi-subterranean chamber tombs.
2. Megalithic structures are exclusively associated with burial practices.
3.  Three basic types of megaliths exist: chamber tombs, unchambered tombs, and megaliths unconnected to burials.
4.  The Ikshvaku period is associated with significant megalithic discoveries in Telangana.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed semi-subterranean chamber tombs, a characteristic feature of megalithic architecture.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While many megalithic structures served as burial sites,  the classification includes other types of monuments not solely for burials.  Statement 3 is correct.  The three categories mentioned accurately reflect the diversity of megalithic structures. Statement 4 is partially correct. While the Ikshvaku period is relevant to archaeological findings in Telangana (like the coin hoard at Phanigiri), the direct connection to megalithic structures specifically isn't explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the context of the discovery of other megalithic sites in Telangana in the same section supports this connection indirectly. Therefore, options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correct statements. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is false.


**2. Consider the following about the Bavikonda Monastery:**

1. It is situated near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
2. It dates back to the 3rd century CE.
3. It is a Theravada Buddhist complex featuring a Mahastupa and Chaitya Griha.
4. The name "Bavikonda" translates to "hill of wells."
5.  It's part of the "Shalihundam-Thotlakonda-Bavikonda-Bojjanakonda-Amravati-Anupu" Buddhist circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The provided text clearly states the location of Bavikonda Monastery near Visakhapatnam, its age (3rd century BCE), its Theravada Buddhist nature with the mentioned structures, and the meaning of its name. The inclusion of Bavikonda in the specified Buddhist circuit further confirms the accuracy of all statements. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not account for the accuracy of all statements.


**3. Consider the following features of the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1.  Destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  Annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
3.  Conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
4.  Significant trading activities centered in Nagapattinam.
5.  A major naval expedition against the Pandya kingdom.


Which of the above accurately describe the Chola Empire's naval activities?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 (b) 2, 3, and 5 only (c) 1, 3, and 4 only (d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion.  The text explicitly mentions the destruction of the Chera navy, the annexation of Sri Lanka's northern part, the conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, and the importance of Nagapattinam as a trading center. Statement 5 is incorrect; there is no mention of a major naval expedition against the Pandya kingdom in the given text.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete or inaccurate representations of the Chola Empire's naval activities.


**4. Consider the following regarding the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1. The register includes manuscripts of Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
2. The register was launched in 1992.
3. The 10th MOWCAP meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, finalized the inclusion of the mentioned works.
4. The MoW program has only one register: the International Register.
5. The MoW program aims to enhance public awareness about documentary heritage.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. The text explicitly mentions the inclusion of the three literary works in the register, the location and outcome of the 10th MOWCAP meeting, and the program's aim to raise public awareness. Statement 2 is partially correct; while the program launched in 1992, the specific regional register's inception date isn't mentioned.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the text clearly states that the MoW program maintains three registers (International, Regional, and National).  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.


**5. Consider the following about the Kalinga Dynasty:**

1. Kharavela's reign is detailed in the Hathigumpha inscription.
2. The dynasty ruled modern-day Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh.
3. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) resulted in the Mauryan annexation of Kalinga.
4.  The dynasty is primarily known for its patronage of Buddhism.
5.  Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built during the Gupta period.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The text supports the accuracy of Kharavela's Hathigumpha inscription, the dynasty's geographical extent, and the Mauryan conquest following the Kalinga War. Statement 4 is partially correct; while the Kalinga dynasty had cultural interactions with Buddhism (as evidenced by the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra from Salihundam, a site in the Kalinga region), the provided text highlights Kharavela's patronage of Jainism more prominently. Statement 5 is incorrect; the caves were constructed during the reign of Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty (not the Gupta period).  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.


**6. Consider the following concerning the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. It was a non-violent protest against temple entry restrictions for lower-caste Hindus.
2. The Satyagraha lasted for exactly one year.
3.  George Joseph played a key role in leading the movement.
4.  Mahatma Gandhi actively supported the movement.
5.  The Akalis of Punjab provided support to the Satyagrahis.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 5 are correct. The provided text confirms the non-violent nature of the protest, Gandhi's support, and the Akalis' assistance. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Satyagraha lasted 604 days, not exactly one year. Statement 3 is partially correct; while George Joseph did take over leadership at some point, the text emphasizes the initial leadership of T.K. Madhavan and the significant role of Periyar. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum:**

1. It commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.
2. It is located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill in Gujarat.
3.  The museum houses one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.
4.  The 2001 Gujarat earthquake measured 7.0 on the Richter scale.
5. The museum was inaugurated in 2001.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The text clearly states the museum's purpose, location, and the presence of a large Miyawaki forest. Statement 4 is incorrect; the earthquake's magnitude was 7.9, not 7.0. Statement 5 is incorrect; the museum was inaugurated in 2022, not 2001. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.


**8. Consider the following types of silk produced in India:**

1. Mulberry silk
2. Eri silk
3. Muga silk
4.  Tussah silk
5.  Ahimsa silk


How many of the above are types of silk produced in India?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five are types of silk produced in India. The text specifically mentions India's production of all five types: Mulberry, Eri, Tropical & Temperate Tasar (which includes Tussah), and Muga. Eri silk is also identified as Ahimsa silk due to the method of production.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not account for all the types mentioned in the text.


**9. Consider the following features of the Abhaya Mudra:**

1. It symbolizes fearlessness.
2.  It is associated with the Buddha.
3.  It is depicted in the Bhumisparsha mudra.
4.  It was used by the Buddha to tame a mad elephant.
5.  It is a mudra of meditation.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The text explicitly defines Abhaya Mudra as a symbol of fearlessness, its connection to the Buddha, and its use in taming the elephant. Statement 3 is incorrect; Bhumisparsha is a different mudra. Statement 5 is incorrect; Dhyana Mudra is the mudra of meditation. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Padma Awards:**

1. They are among India's highest civilian honors.
2. They are awarded annually on Republic Day.
3.  They are conferred posthumously in exceptional cases.
4.  They are awarded in three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.
5.  Recipients can use the award as a suffix or prefix to their names.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The text confirms the Padma Awards' status, their annual Republic Day announcement, and the three award categories. Statement 3 is correct; the text notes that while not normally conferred posthumously, exceptions can be made. Statement 5 is incorrect; the text states that the award is not a title and cannot be used as a suffix or prefix to a name.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the number of correct statements.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Samoothiris, rulers of Kozhikode.
2.  The Ahom dynasty's adoption of Shaivism and the Shakti movement.
3.  The Chalukya dynasty's construction of the Sangameshwar Temple.
4.  Rajaraja Chola's naval expeditions to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

How many of the above are associated with significant historical events in India's past?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements describe significant historical events in India. The Samoothiris were powerful rulers of Kozhikode, a major spice trading center, shaping its history and trade relations. The Ahom dynasty's embrace of Shaivism and Shakti, despite their Tai origins, demonstrates cultural synthesis and religious influence in Assam. The Chalukya dynasty's construction of the Sangameshwar Temple exemplifies their architectural contributions and religious devotion. Rajaraja Chola's naval conquests highlight the Chola empire's maritime power and expansion.  Each statement represents a distinct era and region of Indian history, showcasing diverse political, religious, and cultural aspects.  Therefore, all four are correctly associated with significant historical events. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the historical significance of the events listed.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Ratna Bhandar of the Shree Jagannath Temple.
2.  The Abhaya Mudra in Buddhist iconography.
3.  The Oeko-Tex certification for Eri silk.
4.  The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles award for Kempegowda International Airport.

How many of the above relate to cultural heritage preservation or recognition?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four items relate to cultural heritage preservation or recognition. The Ratna Bhandar represents the preservation of religious artifacts and treasures within a significant temple. The Abhaya Mudra signifies the preservation of Buddhist symbolism and artistic traditions. The Oeko-Tex certification for Eri silk highlights the sustainable practices and preservation of traditional textile crafts. The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles award for Kempegowda International Airport recognizes the architectural and aesthetic merit of a modern structure within a cultural context. Therefore, all four options accurately reflect themes of cultural heritage. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to encompass the full scope of cultural heritage preservation and recognition depicted in the provided list.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).
2.  The Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3.  The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.
4.  The India-US Cultural Property Agreement.

How many of the above are involved in the protection or preservation of cultural heritage?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four entities play a role in protecting or preserving cultural heritage. ICOMOS is an international organization dedicated to the conservation of monuments and sites. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register preserves important documentary heritage. The AMASR Act provides a legal framework for protecting ancient monuments and archaeological sites within India.  The India-US Cultural Property Agreement aims to prevent the illicit trafficking of antiquities.  Therefore, all four are directly involved in the safeguarding of cultural heritage in different capacities. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect, as they fail to recognize the comprehensive involvement of all four entities in cultural heritage protection and preservation.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The transhumance practices of nomadic tribes in the Himalayas.
2.  The Sangameshwar Temple submerged in the Krishna River.
3.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum in Bhuj.
4.  The delisting of "untraceable" centrally protected monuments by the ASI.


How many of the above deal with the preservation or loss of cultural or historical sites?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements relate to the preservation or loss of cultural or historical sites. Transhumance, while a practice, is tied to the preservation of nomadic cultures and their relationship with the landscape. The submergence of the Sangameshwar Temple represents the loss of a historical site due to environmental factors. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum is a deliberate effort to preserve the memory of a tragic event and its impact. The delisting of monuments by the ASI reflects a decision regarding the preservation or abandonment of historical sites deemed no longer of national importance.  Therefore, all four illustrate different aspects of the preservation or loss of cultural and historical locations. Options (a), (b), and (c) overlook the relevance of at least one of the listed elements to the theme of preservation or loss of cultural/historical sites.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Bharat Ratna award.
2.  The Dadasaheb Phalke Award.
3.  The UNESCO’s Prix Versailles award.
4.  The Padma Awards.

How many of the above are Indian awards recognizing achievements in various fields?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four are Indian awards recognizing achievement across diverse fields. The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is the highest award in Indian cinema. The Padma Awards encompass various fields of achievement. The UNESCO Prix Versailles, while a global award, is specifically mentioned in the context of recognition given to an Indian airport. Thus, all four awards are relevant to the question. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they fail to acknowledge the Indian context and significance of all four listed awards.  The inclusion of the Prix Versailles highlights the international recognition of Indian achievements, adding another layer of relevance to the overall theme.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The Vikramshila University.
2.  The Nalanda University.
3.  The Odantapuri University.
4.  The Nagarjunakonda University.

How many of the above were historically significant centers of Buddhist learning in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four were historically significant centers of Buddhist learning in India. Vikramshila, Nalanda, and Odantapuri were prominent universities during different periods, playing crucial roles in the dissemination of Buddhist knowledge. Nagarjunakonda, while not strictly a university in the same sense as the others, was a significant center associated with the renowned Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna and his Mahayana Buddhist teachings.  Therefore, all four played vital roles in the history of Buddhist scholarship in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the historical significance of all four locations as centers of Buddhist learning.  The inclusion of Nagarjunakonda highlights the broader context of Buddhist intellectual activity beyond formal university structures.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas.
2.  The Panchatantra.
3.  The Sahṛdayāloka-Locana.
4.  The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya.

How many of the above are included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) register or represent significant historical events?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the items are directly connected to UNESCO's MOW register or significant historical events. The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are specifically mentioned as being included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The Asokan Elephant Pillar, while not explicitly listed in a register, marks a significant historical event from the Mauryan Empire. Option (d) is incorrect as it overstates the direct connection of all four items to the specified criteria. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of items directly linked to UNESCO's MOW register or significant historical events. The combination of literary works and an archaeological artifact highlights the diverse forms of cultural heritage preservation.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Gandhi Sarovar.
2.  The Kedarnath Temple.
3.  The Kamakhya Temple.
4.  The Sangameshwar Temple.

How many of the above are significant religious sites in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four are significant religious sites in India. The Gandhi Sarovar is associated with Hindu mythology and the practice of Yoga. The Kedarnath Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Kamakhya Temple is a significant Shakti shrine. The Sangameshwar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Therefore, all four locations hold religious significance for various groups within India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the religious significance of all four sites. The diversity of religious traditions represented (Hinduism, specifically Shaivism and Shaktism) highlights the rich tapestry of religious beliefs in India.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  Neolithic-Chalcolithic burial practices.
2.  The Ahom Dynasty's administration.
3.  The Kozhikode's recognition as India's first 'City of Literature'.
4.  The Denisovans' presence in the Tibetan Baishiya Karst Cave.

How many of the above represent aspects of India's history or cultural heritage?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four items represent aspects of India's history or cultural heritage. Neolithic-Chalcolithic burial practices offer insights into ancient Indian funerary rituals. The Ahom Dynasty's administrative system reflects a unique political structure in Assam's history. Kozhikode's recognition highlights its literary and cultural significance. The discovery of Denisovan remains in Tibet expands our understanding of human migration and prehistoric presence in the region. Therefore, all four entries are relevant to understanding different facets of India's past and cultural identity. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the broad scope of historical and cultural information represented by the four elements.  The diverse time periods and geographical locations covered underscore the rich and complex history of India.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Handloom Day.
2.  Eri silk and its Oeko-Tex certification.
3.  The Swadeshi Movement.
4.  The "Kashi Culture Pathway" initiative.

How many of the above relate to the promotion or preservation of Indian textiles or cultural heritage?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four items are linked to the promotion or preservation of Indian textiles or cultural heritage. National Handloom Day celebrates the handloom industry and its cultural significance. Eri silk's Oeko-Tex certification promotes sustainable practices in the textile sector. The Swadeshi Movement, while primarily a political movement, significantly impacted the promotion of Indian textiles. The "Kashi Culture Pathway" initiative aims to protect cultural heritage, indirectly benefiting textile traditions associated with the region. Therefore, all four options contribute to the broader theme of promoting or preserving Indian textiles and cultural heritage. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they fail to account for the indirect but relevant connections of all four elements to the stated theme. The diverse approaches (celebration, certification, political movement, and international collaboration) demonstrate the multifaceted nature of cultural heritage preservation efforts.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The practice of seasonal livestock movement involving the migration of human communities with their herds.
2.  A UNESCO intangible cultural heritage designation awarded in 2023 to traditions in 10 European states and Switzerland.
3.  A prevalent practice among nomadic tribes in the Himalayas, such as Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas.
4.  A system also existing in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the concept of transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately describe transhumance.  Statement 1 defines transhumance directly. Statement 2 mentions the 2023 UNESCO recognition of specific transhumance traditions, highlighting its global significance and cultural importance. Statement 3 correctly identifies the practice's prevalence in the Himalayas among specified nomadic groups. Statement 4 accurately points out the geographical spread of transhumance in the Indian plains, demonstrating its widespread nature.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  A premium quality Indian cotton with 100% traceability and certification.
2.  A joint initiative by the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and industry.
3.  An initiative utilizing blockchain technology for traceability.
4.  Implemented by the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT).

How many of the above statements correctly describe the "Kasturi Cotton Bharat" initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative.  The initiative focuses on high-quality, traceable cotton, involves multiple stakeholders, and leverages blockchain technology.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the implementing agency is the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (TEXPROCIL), not NIFT. The inclusion of NIFT as a distractor plays on the potential association of textiles and fashion but is factually incorrect.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  A temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.
2.  Annually submerged in the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.
3.  Located at the confluence of the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers.
4.  Built by the Vijayanagara dynasty.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Sangameshwar Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is annually submerged due to flooding. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; it is located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers (along with five other tributaries). Statement 4 is also incorrect; it was built by the Chalukya dynasty.  The inclusion of the Vijayanagara dynasty as a distractor leverages the proximity of both dynasties in time and location but is factually incorrect regarding this specific temple.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Awarded the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, the Akademi's highest honor.
2.  Author of "Vagrants in the Valley" and "Once Upon a Monsoon Time."
3.  A recipient of the Padma Vibhushan award.
4.  Known primarily for works in the Marathi language.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Ruskin Bond?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Ruskin Bond received the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship and authored the mentioned books.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while he has received numerous awards, the Padma Vibhushan is not among them.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; his works are primarily in English. The inclusion of the Padma Vibhushan and the specification of Marathi as the language creates plausible distractors due to the general association with literary awards and the prevalence of Marathi literature.


**5. Consider the following related to the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama Dynasty marked the empire's decline.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign saw the acquisition of the Raichur doab.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were tax collectors appointed by the Raya.
4.  The Virupaksha Temple is a significant architectural marvel of the empire.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. Krishnadevaraya's reign is known for territorial expansion, including the Raichur doab. The Amara-Nayakas were powerful regional governors who collected taxes. The Virupaksha Temple stands as a testament to Vijayanagara architecture.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sangama Dynasty was the *founding* dynasty, not the one that marked the decline (that was the Aravidu Dynasty). The deliberate inaccuracy in statement 1, using a closely related dynasty, creates a strong distractor.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Santhal Rebellion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  Karl Marx did refer to the Santhal Rebellion as India's first organized mass revolution. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act was indeed a direct consequence of the rebellion. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Zamindari system wasn't abolished as a direct result of the rebellion.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the rebellion impacted Bihar, its primary location was in the Santhal Parganas region, which spans across present-day Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha. Therefore, only two of the statements accurately reflect the Santhal Rebellion.


15. Consider the following about the Odisha Famine of 1866:

1. It is also known as the "Na-Anka Famine."
2. The famine was primarily caused by widespread locust attacks.
3. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw was the Commissioner of Odisha during the famine.
4. The Puri Canal was constructed as a direct response to the famine.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Odisha Famine of 1866?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Odisha Famine of 1866 was known as the "Na-Anka Famine." Thomas Edward Ravenshaw held the position of Commissioner of Odisha during the famine. The construction of the Puri Canal followed the famine. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the famine's causes were multifaceted, including administrative failures, natural disasters, and economic factors, not solely locust attacks. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately describe the Odisha Famine.


16. Consider the following regarding the Battle of Saragarhi:

1. It was fought between the British Indian Army and Afghan tribesmen.
2.  All 21 Sikh soldiers involved were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.
3. The battle took place at Saragarhi in present-day Pakistan.
4. Havildar Ishar Singh led the Sikh soldiers in the battle.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Battle of Saragarhi?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Battle of Saragarhi was fought between the British Indian Army (specifically, the 36th Sikh Regiment) and Afridi and Orakzai tribesmen. The battle took place in present-day Pakistan. Havildar Ishar Singh was the leader of the Sikh soldiers who displayed extraordinary bravery. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the soldiers were posthumously awarded the Indian Order of Merit, not the Victoria Cross. Therefore, three of the statements accurately describe the Battle of Saragarhi.



**1. Consider the following features related to Moidams:**

1.  An earthen mound (Ga-Moidam) topped by a central shrine (Chou Cha Li).
2.  An octagonal wall (Garh) symbolizing the Tai universe.
3.  A brick-and-stone vault (Tak) with a grave-pit (Garvha).
4.  Annual rituals like Me-Dam-Me-Phi (ancestor worship) and Tarpan (libation ceremony).
5.  Protection by special officers called Moidam Phukans and a guard group known as Moidamiya.
6.  Presence of grave goods and sometimes even servants.

How many of the above-mentioned features are directly related to the architectural design or physical structure of a Moidam?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) Only five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Features 1, 2, and 3 explicitly describe the architectural components of a Moidam.  Feature 5 details the security arrangements, which are integral to the physical preservation of the structure.  While features 4 and 6 relate to cultural practices and burial customs associated with Moidams, they are not directly part of the architectural design or physical structure itself.  Therefore, five of the listed features are directly related to the architectural design or physical structure of a Moidam. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of features directly related to the physical structure of a Moidam.


**2. Consider the following regarding burial practices in India:**

1.  Pit burials (oval shape) accompanied by animal skeletal remains (Burzahom).
2.  North-south orientation of bodies, with coffins and paired burials (Harappan Civilization).
3.  Stone erect structures and urn burials (Megalithic period).
4.  Embalming and entombment, later cremation with burial of ashes (Tai-Ahom).

How many of these burial practices involved the use of some form of container or structure for the deceased?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Harappan Civilization used coffins, the Megalithic period utilized stone structures, and the Tai-Ahom initially employed entombment.  Burzahom, while using pits, did not necessarily utilize a purpose-built container in the same way as the other examples.  Therefore, three of the mentioned practices involved the use of containers or structures. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either undercount or overcount the number of practices that involved the use of containers.


**3. Consider the following elements related to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum:**

1.  Commemorates victims of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake.
2.  Located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, near Bhujio Fort.

4.  The 2001 earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale.
5.  Bhujio Fort was built for the defense of Bhuj in 1723.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum and its surrounding area?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the museum. Statement 5 is also correct. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the magnitude of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake was 7.7, not 7.8.  Therefore, four of the statements accurately describe the museum and its surroundings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the number of accurate statements.


**4. Consider the following individuals associated with the Santhal Rebellion:**

1.  Siddho
2.  Kanho

4.  Bhairav
5.  Phulo
6.  Jhano

How many of these individuals were named as leaders of the Santhal Rebellion?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six individuals – Siddho, Kanho, Chand, Bhairav, Phulo, and Jhano – are explicitly mentioned as leaders of the Santhal Rebellion.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d). Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they understate the number of named leaders.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1.  India's highest award in cinema.
2.  Presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
3.  Instituted in 1969 to honor the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke.
4.  The recipient receives a Golden Lotus medallion, a shawl, and a cash prize.

How many of these statements are accurate descriptions of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. However, statement 5 is incorrect; Satyajit Ray received the award in 1992, not 1984.  Therefore, four of the statements accurately describe the award. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to either undercounting or overcounting the accurate statements.


**6. Consider the following about the Bengal Gazette:**

1.  Founded on January 29, 1780.
2.  Published in Kolkata (then Calcutta).
3.  Founded by James Augustus Hicky.

5.  Criticized Lord Curzon.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Bengal Gazette?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the Bengal Gazette.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; the Bengal Gazette criticized Warren Hastings, not Lord Curzon. Therefore, four statements are correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the number of accurate statements.


**7.  Consider the following concerning the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO):**

1.  A world championship mathematics competition for high school students.
2.  Held annually in a different country.
3.  First held in 1959 in Romania.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the IMO?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly describe the IMO. However, statement 5 is incorrect; the provided text states that India's best performance was in 2024, not 2023.  Therefore, four statements are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the accurate number of statements.


**8. Consider the following related to the World's Oldest Calendar discovered at Göbekli Tepe:**

1.  A solar-lunar calendar.
2.  Used to track time and significant celestial events.
3.  Features V-shaped symbols representing days, totaling 365.
4.  Includes carvings of animals and abstract designs.
5.  Commemorates a comet strike around 12,000 BCE.


How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the calendar's features?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the calendar. However, statement 5 is slightly inaccurate; the text mentions a comet strike around 10,850 BCE, not 12,000 BCE. Therefore, four of the statements are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the accurate number of statements.


**9. Consider the following concerning the Olympic Order Award:**

1.  Established in 1975.
2.  Awarded for distinguished service to the Olympic Movement.
3.  The highest award presented by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
4.  The IOC is a non-profit global organization.
5.  Abhinav Bindra received the award in 2008.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Olympic Order Award and the IOC?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the Olympic Order Award and the IOC. However, statement 5 is incorrect; while Abhinav Bindra won a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the passage does not state that he received the Olympic Order Award. Therefore, four statements are accurate.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the accurate number of statements.


**10. Consider the following about the Commonwealth Games (CWG):**

1.  First held in 1930 in Hamilton, Canada.
2.  Held every four years.
3.  India hosted the Games in 2010 in Delhi.
4.  The 2026 edition will be held in Glasgow and features only 10 sports.
5.  Six sports in which India won medals in 2022 CWG were dropped from the 2026 edition.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of the CWG?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect aspects of the Commonwealth Games.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they understate the accurate number of statements.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Memory of the World (MoW) Programme:**

1. It was launched in the late 20th century.
2.  It maintains three distinct registers: International, Regional, and National.
3. The International Register exclusively features documents from UNESCO member states.
4.  One of its primary goals is to raise global awareness of documentary heritage.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Memory of the World (MoW) Programme, launched in 1992 by UNESCO, aims to safeguard documentary heritage worldwide.  Statement 1 is correct; it was indeed launched in the late 20th century. Statement 2 is also correct as the programme uses an International, Regional, and National Register system to categorize and preserve documents. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The International Register includes entries from various countries, not limited to UNESCO member states alone.  Many Indian documents, such as the Tamil Medical Manuscript Collection and Saiva manuscripts, are included. Statement 4 accurately reflects one of the key objectives of the MoW Programme – to increase public awareness of the importance of documentary heritage.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**2. Consider the following literary works:**

1.  *Ramcharitmanas*
2.  *Panchatantra*
3.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*
4.  Works by Ruskin Bond (e.g., *Vagrants in the Valley*)

How many of the above are written in Sanskrit?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

*Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, a text on Indian poetics, is written in Sanskrit by Acharya Anandvardhan.  *Panchatantra*, a collection of fables, is also originally in Sanskrit, authored by Vishnu Sharma.  However, *Ramcharitmanas*, an epic poem, is written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit, by Goswami Tulsidas.  Ruskin Bond's works are primarily in English. Therefore, only two of the listed works are in Sanskrit.


**3. Consider the following features of the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri:**

1.  It is dedicated to a Hindu trinity comprising Lord Jagannath, his sister Subhadra, and his brother Balabhadra.
2.  Its architecture exemplifies the Dravidian style, characterized by its gopurams and vimanas.
3.  The Ratna Bhandar, its treasury, contains jewels belonging to the temple's deities.
4. The temple's main shrine (Vimana) is built in the Rekha Deula style.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the temple is dedicated to the trinity of Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra. Statement 2 is incorrect; the temple's architecture primarily follows the Kalinga style, a sub-style of Nagara architecture, not the Dravidian style. Statement 3 is correct; the Ratna Bhandar indeed houses the temple's valuable jewels. Statement 4 is also correct; the Vimana, the main shrine, is built in the Rekha Deula style, a characteristic of Kalinga architecture. Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi:**

1. It is dedicated to a form of Lord Vishnu.
2.  It showcases the Nagara style of temple architecture.
3.  Its construction spanned centuries, with contributions from various dynasties.
4. It's located in a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Virupaksha Temple is dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, a form of Shiva, not Vishnu. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the temple exemplifies the Dravida style, not the Nagara style. Statement 3 is correct; its construction involved contributions from Chalukyas, Pallavas, Hoysalas, Cholas, and the Vijayanagara Empire. Statement 4 is correct; the temple is part of the Group of Monuments at Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following about the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD):**

1. It's observed by the Ministry of Culture in association with an international Buddhist organization.
2. It commemorates an event related to Lord Buddha's descent from a celestial realm.
3.  It's directly linked to the celebration of Pali's status as a classical language.
4. The event is primarily celebrated in the state of Bihar.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation (IBC), observes IAD. Statement 2 is also correct; IAD commemorates Lord Buddha's descent from Tāvatimsa-devaloka to Sankassiya. Statement 3 is correct; the recent declaration of Pali as a classical language is often celebrated alongside IAD. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while the event commemorates Buddha's visit to Sankassiya, which is now in Uttar Pradesh, the celebration is not limited to Bihar.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following individuals associated with significant contributions to Indian literature:**

1.  Goswami Tulsidas
2.  Pt. Vishnu Sharma
3.  Acharya Anandvardhan
4.  Ruskin Bond

How many of the above are recipients of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Ruskin Bond among the listed individuals is a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship.  While Goswami Tulsidas, Pt. Vishnu Sharma, and Acharya Anandvardhan are significant figures in Indian literature, the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is a relatively modern award, and it's not given posthumously.  Therefore, only one of the listed individuals received this fellowship.


**7. Consider the following about the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake:**

1. The earthquake's epicenter was in Bhuj.
2.  The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum commemorates the victims of this earthquake.
3. The museum is located on a hill that also houses a historic fort.
4. The Miyawaki forest at the museum is one of the world's smallest such forests.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Bhuj was the epicenter of the 2001 earthquake. Statement 2 is also correct; the Smritivan museum was built to remember the victims. Statement 3 is correct; the museum is situated on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, which also features Bhujio Fort.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Miyawaki forest at the museum is described as one of the world's *largest*, not smallest, such forests. Therefore, three statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1. It's India's highest award in cinema.
2.  It's presented annually by the Ministry of Culture.
3.  It was instituted to commemorate Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary.
4. The award includes a cash prize.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; it is India's highest film award. Statement 2 is incorrect; it's presented by the Directorate of Film Festivals, not the Ministry of Culture. Statement 3 is correct; it was instituted in 1969 to mark Dadasaheb Phalke's birth centenary.  Statement 4 is correct; the award includes a cash prize.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  Indus Valley Civilization:**

1. Standardized weights and measures were used in trade.
2.  The civilization engaged in both internal and external trade.
3.  The script used is fully deciphered.
4. The primary deity was a female deity known as the Mother Goddess.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; standardized weights and measures indicate a developed trade system. Statement 2 is also correct; evidence suggests both internal and external trade networks.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Indus script remains undeciphered. While statement 4 mentions the Mother Goddess, it's not entirely accurate to state she was the *primary* deity.  Pasupati, a male deity, is also prominently represented. Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Lothal archaeological site:**

1. It's located near the Gulf of Khambat.
2.  It's a significant site of the Indus Valley Civilization.
3.  It features the world's oldest known man-made dry dock.
4. The National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) is being developed at this site.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. Lothal is situated near the Gulf of Khambat, a key location in the Indus Valley Civilization. It's renowned for its ancient man-made dry dock.  Furthermore, the Indian government is developing the NMHC at Lothal to showcase India's rich maritime history.


**11. Consider the following about the Sangameswar Temple:**

1.  It's dedicated to Lord Shiva.
2.  It's located at the confluence of several rivers.

4. It was built by the Chola dynasty.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. Statement 2 is also correct; it's situated at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, along with other tributaries.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; there are Sangameswar temples in other states besides Andhra Pradesh (e.g., Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu).  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Chalukya dynasty, not the Cholas, built the Sangameswar temple discussed in the text. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**12. Consider the following related to the Kamakhya Temple:**

1. It's located on the Nilachal hills.
2.  It's one of the 51 Shakti Peethas.
3.  It was originally built by the Koch dynasty.
4. Its architecture is solely based on the Pala style.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the temple is situated on the Nilachal hills. Statement 2 is also correct; it's considered a significant Shakti Peetha. Statement 3 is partially correct; while the Koch dynasty rebuilt the temple in the mid-16th century, the original temple predated their rule.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the temple's architecture is a blend of styles, including Upper Burma and Pala styles, but not solely Pala.  Therefore, three statements are largely correct.


**13. Consider the following statements about Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1. She was the queen of Malwa.
2. She was born in the 18th century.
3. She significantly contributed to temple reconstruction.
4. She primarily patronized poets writing in the Hindi language.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; she ruled Malwa. Statement 2 is correct; she was born in 1725. Statement 3 is also correct; she's known for her contributions to temple reconstruction, including the Kashi Vishvanath and Somnath temples. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while she patronized poets, her patronage extended to Marathi poets like Moropant, not solely Hindi poets. Therefore, three statements are correct.


1. Consider the following:

1.  The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Vishnu.
2.  The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi is a prime example of Dravidian architecture.
3.  The Kamakhya Temple in Assam is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas.
4.  The Alagar Temple in Tamil Nadu is associated with the Tamil epic Silappadikaram.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are factually accurate. The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi is indeed a prominent example of Dravidian architecture. The Kamakhya Temple is recognized as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas.  The Alagar Temple's mention in the Silappadikaram is well-documented.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal is dedicated to Lord Shiva, not Lord Vishnu.  Therefore, only three of the statements are correct.  The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but incorrect statement (Lord Vishnu instead of Lord Shiva) adds a layer of difficulty, requiring precise knowledge to identify the inaccuracies.


2. Consider the following features associated with specific religious sites:

1.  A footprint believed to be that of Lord Vishnu, located in Gaya, Bihar.
2.  A temple submerged annually due to the backwaters of the Srisailam dam.
3.  A temple complex featuring 108 temples, showcasing intricately carved stone architecture.
4.  A temple located on the Nilachal hills, reconstructed in the mid-16th century by the Koch dynasty.

Which of the above features are associated with the Vishnupad Temple, Sangameswar Temple (Nandyal), Eklingji Temple, and Kamakhya Temple respectively?

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4
(b) 4, 2, 3, 1
(c) 1, 2, 4, 3
(d) 3, 1, 2, 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Vishnupad Temple in Gaya, Bihar, is known for the footprint of Lord Vishnu. The Sangameswar Temple in Nandyal is annually submerged. The Eklingji Temple is famous for its complex of 108 temples. The Kamakhya Temple is situated on the Nilachal hills and was reconstructed by the Koch dynasty. Therefore, the correct sequence matching the features to the temples is 1, 2, 3, 4.  The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to accurately link specific features to their respective temples, requiring detailed knowledge of each site. Incorrect options provide plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings, demanding precise recall.


3. Consider the following concerning the Jyotirlingas and related sites:

1.  The Kedarnath Temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas.
2.  The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is situated on the eastern bank of the Ganges.
3.  The Somnath Temple was raided by Mahmud of Ghazni.
4.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar significantly contributed to the restoration of the Somnath Temple.

How many of the above statements regarding Jyotirlingas and their associated historical contexts are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  Kedarnath is indeed one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. The Somnath Temple was famously raided by Mahmud of Ghazni, and Devi Ahilyabai Holkar is known for her contributions to its restoration. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple is located on the *western* bank of the Ganges, not the eastern bank.  The close proximity of the correct and incorrect information regarding the Kashi Vishwanath Temple's location creates a challenging distractor.


4. Consider the following statements about historical figures and their contributions:

1.  Adi Shankaracharya established four cardinal mathas to promote Advaita Vedanta.
2.  Bhagwan Mahaveer is associated with Jainism.
3.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was the queen of Marwar.
4.  Moropant was a renowned Sanskrit scholar patronized by Ahilyabai Holkar.

How many of these statements about significant historical personalities are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. Adi Shankaracharya did establish four cardinal mathas. Bhagwan Mahaveer is a central figure in Jainism. Moropant was indeed a poet patronized by Ahilyabai Holkar. However, statement 3 is incorrect. Devi Ahilyabai Holkar was the queen of Malwa, not Marwar.  The subtle difference between Malwa and Marwar creates a challenging distractor for candidates who may have a general knowledge of the historical period but lack precise detail.


5. Consider the following regarding temple architecture and associated elements:

1.  The Virupaksha Temple's architecture is purely Dravidian in style.
2.  The Mahabodhi Temple's shikhara is characterized by a curvilinear design.
3.  The Alagar Temple's mandapam pillars showcase Nayaka art style.
4.  The Jagannath Temple's Ratna Bhandar is located on the southern side of the Jagamohana.


Which of the above statements accurately describe aspects of temple architecture and related features?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The Mahabodhi Temple's shikhara does indeed have a curvilinear design, and the Alagar Temple's mandapam pillars are known for their Nayaka style. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while predominantly Dravidian, the Virupaksha Temple exhibits influences from other styles as well. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Ratna Bhandar is located on the *northern*, not southern, side of the Jagamohana.  The inclusion of partially correct statements (like the Virupaksha Temple's architecture) and the precise directional detail in statement 4 increases the question's difficulty level.


6. Consider the following about the geographical locations and historical significance of certain sites:

1.  Gandhi Sarovar originates from the Chorabari Glacier.
2.  Jyotirmath is the summer abode of Lord Badrinath.
3.  Hampi was the capital of the Chola kingdom.
4.  Lothal is known for its ancient man-made dry dock.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the geographical locations and historical significance of the mentioned sites?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. Gandhi Sarovar does originate from the Chorabari Glacier, and Lothal is famous for its ancient dry dock. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Jyotirmath is the *winter* abode of Lord Badrinath, not the summer abode. Statement 3 is also incorrect; Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom, not the Chola kingdom.  The inclusion of geographically close but historically incorrect information (like the Chola vs. Vijayanagara kingdoms) increases the challenge.


7. Consider the following regarding archaeological discoveries and sites:

1.  The Chandravalli cave complex contains a Shiva linga.
2.  The Ooragutta site is associated with the Neolithic era.
3.  Megalithic monuments known as 'Dolmenoid Cists' are common in the Telangana region.
4.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built for Buddhist monks.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect archaeological discoveries and their contexts?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Chandravalli cave complex does contain a Shiva linga, and Dolmenoid Cists are indeed found in Telangana. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Ooragutta is an Iron Age megalithic site, not Neolithic. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves were built for *Jain* monks, not Buddhist monks.  The subtle differences between Neolithic/Iron Age and Buddhist/Jain contexts create difficult distractors.



8. Consider the following statements about pilgrimage corridors and related developments:

1.  The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor primarily aimed to connect the temple to the banks of the Yamuna River.
2.  The Mahakal Lok Corridor features murals from the ‘Shiv Puran’.
3.  The Vishnupad Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva.
4.  The Mahabodhi Temple Complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of pilgrimage corridors and their associated religious sites?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Mahakal Lok Corridor does feature murals from the Shiv Puran, and the Mahabodhi Temple Complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor connects the temple to the banks of the Ganges, not the Yamuna. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Vishnupad Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, not Lord Shiva. The use of closely related rivers (Ganges and Yamuna) and deities (Vishnu and Shiva) creates effective distractors.


9. Consider the following related to the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC):

1.  A bearded man statue from Mohenjo-daro is interpreted as a warrior.
2.  The IVC had a well-developed system of standardized weights and measures.
3.  The IVC's writing system is fully deciphered.
4.  The IVC primarily worshipped a single, dominant deity.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate.  The IVC did have a well-developed system of standardized weights and measures, and while there were multiple deities, a Mother Goddess and a Proto-Shiva figure were prominent. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the bearded man statue is interpreted as a *priest*, not a warrior. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the IVC writing system remains largely undeciphered.  The contrast between priestly/warrior roles and the deciphered/undeciphered aspects of the writing system creates effective distractors.


10. Consider the following about Kalinga and its historical context:

1.  The Kalinga War led to Ashoka's conversion to Jainism.
2.  Kharavela is associated with the Hathigumpha inscription.
3.  The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves contain only Buddhist art.
4.  Salihundam is known for its association with the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia.

Which of the above statements accurately reflects aspects of the Kalinga region and its history?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Kharavela is indeed linked to the Hathigumpha inscription, and Salihundam played a role in the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Kalinga War led to Ashoka's conversion to *Buddhism*, not Jainism. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while predominantly Jain, the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves contain some Vaishnavite elements as well.  The confusion between Buddhism and Jainism, coupled with the nuanced nature of the cave art, creates challenging distractors.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics-related aspects and adhering to all specified criteria.  Difficulty is aimed at the 'difficult' level, requiring precise factual recall and analysis to avoid plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the economic contributions of Devi Ahilyabai Holkar:**

1.  She implemented significant land reforms that boosted agricultural productivity in Malwa.
2.  Her reign witnessed substantial investments in infrastructure projects, such as canals and roads.
3.  She actively patronized arts and scholarship, supporting various artists and scholars.
4.  Her economic policies focused primarily on strengthening the Malwa region's trade with European powers.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect Devi Ahilyabai Holkar's economic contributions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct.  Devi Ahilyabai Holkar is known for her patronage of arts and literature, supporting scholars like Khushali Ram and poets like Moropant.  This fostered intellectual growth and indirectly contributed to the region's cultural and possibly economic well-being.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While she ruled Malwa, there's no prominent historical evidence suggesting her economic policies focused specifically on trade with European powers. Her economic focus was primarily internal development and welfare.

Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The provided text highlights her temple reconstruction efforts and cultural patronage but doesn't detail specific land reforms or large-scale infrastructure projects as primary economic initiatives.  While infrastructure indirectly supports economic activity, the direct link to her policies isn't established in the given information.  The focus on temple construction might even suggest a different economic prioritization.


**2. Consider the following regarding the economic impact of the Santhal Rebellion (1855-1856):**

1.  The rebellion directly led to the abolition of the zamindari system in the Rajmahal Hills.
2.  The British government implemented the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act of 1876 as a direct consequence of the rebellion's economic disruption.
3.  The rebellion significantly hampered the British East India Company's revenue collection in the affected region.
4.  The rebellion resulted in widespread land redistribution among the Santhal population.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the economic consequences of the Santhal Rebellion?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act was a direct response to the rebellion, aiming to address some of the underlying economic grievances that fueled the uprising.

Statement 3 is correct.  The rebellion's disruption of British administration inevitably affected revenue collection.  The scale of this impact is difficult to quantify precisely without further data, but the disruption is a logical consequence.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the rebellion might have contributed to long-term changes in land tenure, it didn't directly lead to the abolition of the zamindari system in the Rajmahal Hills at that time.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act aimed at protecting Santhal land rights from exploitation, but it didn't result in widespread land redistribution. The act prevented further land alienation, not necessarily redistributing existing land holdings.


**3. Consider the following concerning the Chola Empire's economic activities:**

1.  The Chola rulers established a sophisticated system of internal trade routes that facilitated the movement of goods within the empire.
2.  The Chola navy played a crucial role in protecting trade routes and ensuring the safe passage of merchant ships.
3.  The Chola Empire’s economy was primarily agrarian, with agriculture being the dominant economic activity.
4.  The Chola rulers actively discouraged foreign trade, preferring a self-sufficient economic model.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the economic aspects of the Chola Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are largely correct. The Cholas had an extensive network of internal trade routes, a powerful navy that protected seaborne trade, and an economy heavily reliant on agriculture.  The scale and sophistication of their trade networks, both internal and external, are well-documented in historical sources.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Cholas were known for their extensive maritime trade, interacting with various parts of Southeast Asia and beyond.  Their economic model wasn't characterized by a rejection of foreign trade.  Their naval power and trade networks were key components of their economic strength.


**4. Consider the following about the economic impact of the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. The Satyagraha directly resulted in the immediate abolition of untouchability in Travancore.
2. The movement significantly boosted industrial development in Travancore.
3. The Satyagraha led to legal reforms concerning temple entry and public service access for lower castes.
4.  The economic impact of the Satyagraha was primarily felt in the agricultural sector of Travancore.

Which of the above statements best reflects the economic consequences of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is the most accurate reflection of the economic consequences of the Vaikom Satyagraha. The legal reforms resulting from the movement, such as the Temple Entry Proclamation, had long-term implications for social and economic inclusion.  While not directly economic, opening up opportunities to lower castes in government and public life had significant indirect economic benefits.

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. The Satyagraha didn't immediately abolish untouchability; it was a gradual process.  The movement's impact on industrial development is not directly linked in the given information. The text doesn't provide information to support the claim of a primary impact on the agricultural sector.  The primary impact was the social change, with indirect economic implications.


These questions aim for a higher difficulty level by weaving in plausible distractors related to the given historical context but not directly stated in the text, forcing candidates to rely on their understanding of broader historical and economic principles.


**1. Consider the following statements related to Kasturi Cotton Bharat:**

1. It is solely a Ministry of Textiles initiative.
2.  It utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.
3.  The Cotton Corporation of India is not involved in its implementation.
4. TEXPROCIL is the implementing agency.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The initiative indeed uses blockchain technology for complete traceability and certification of Indian cotton, making statement 2 correct. Statement 3 is false as the Cotton Corporation of India is a key partner. Finally, TEXPROCIL (Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council) is the implementing agency, making statement 4 correct.  Thus, only two statements (2 and 4) are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Project PARI:**

1. It is executed by the Ministry of Culture directly.
2.  It aims to promote art only in rural landscapes.
3.  It involves artists creating only murals and sculptures.
4. Thangka painting is one of the art forms included.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Project PARI is executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art, both autonomous institutions under the Ministry of Culture, not directly by the Ministry itself.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The project aims to democratize art through public installations in *urban* landscapes, making statement 2 incorrect. Statement 3 is also incorrect, as it includes various art forms like paintings.  Statement 4 is correct; Thangka painting is specifically mentioned as an included art form. Therefore, only one statement (4) is correct.


**3. Consider the following about the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative:**

1. It is limited to 10 tourist destinations.
2.  It focuses solely on training experienced tourism professionals.
3.  Its aim is to enhance the tourist experience through local ambassadors.
4.  It emphasizes training only men to develop new tourism products.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The initiative covers 50 tourist destinations, making statement 1 incorrect. It specifically emphasizes training women and youth, contradicting statement 4.  Statement 2 is incorrect because it aims to provide training to a broader range of people, not just experienced professionals. The core aim is to improve the tourist experience by engaging 'tourist-friendly' local people as ambassadors, making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only one statement (3) is correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories primarily focused on inland river battles.
2.  The Chola conquest extended to parts of Sri Lanka but not the Maldives.
3.  Rajendra I's expeditions reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
4. Nagapattinam served as an insignificant trading center for the Cholas.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Rajaraja I's and Rajendra I's naval power was instrumental in their expansion. Rajaraja I's victories included significant naval battles, not limited to inland rivers, making statement 1 incorrect. The Chola empire did extend its influence to the Maldives, contrary to statement 2. Statement 3 is correct; Rajendra I's conquests included the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Nagapattinam was a major trading center, not insignificant, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only one statement (3) is correct.


**5. Consider the following about the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative:**

1. It is primarily led by the World Heritage Committee.
2.  Transhumance involves the seasonal movement of livestock only.
3.  The practice is prevalent only in the Himalayan region of India.
4.  Two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The initiative is led by ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites), not the World Heritage Committee, making statement 1 incorrect. Transhumance involves the seasonal movement of both livestock and human communities, making statement 2 incorrect. While prevalent in the Himalayas, the practice also exists in other plains regions of India, making statement 3 incorrect. Statement 4 is correct; two transhumance traditions received this recognition in 2023.  Therefore, only two statements (4) are correct.


**6. Consider the following related to UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Beijing.
2.  The Panchatantra is not included in the register.
3.  The MOW program was launched in 1998.
4.  The Ramcharitmanas is one of the included Indian works.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, making statement 1 incorrect. The Panchatantra was included, contradicting statement 2. The MOW program started in 1992, not 1998, making statement 3 incorrect. Statement 4 is correct; the Ramcharitmanas is listed.  Therefore, only one statement (4) is correct.

2.  The Gunner Burkill's tomb is among the monuments facing delisting.
3.  The decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Tourism.
4.  "Missing Monuments" is a term officially used in the AMASR Act.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ASI intends to delist only 18 out of 24 "untraceable" monuments, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Gunner Burkill's tomb is indeed among those facing delisting, making statement 2 correct. The decision is based on a report by the Ministry of Culture, not Tourism, making statement 3 incorrect.  "Missing Monuments" is not an official term in the AMASR Act, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only one statement (2) is correct.


**8. Consider the following about the contributions and legacy of Swami Vivekananda:**

1.  He primarily preached Advaita Vedanta philosophy.
2.  His address at the World's Parliament of Religions was poorly received.
3.  He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1890.
4.  He inspired Jamsetji Tata to establish the Indian Institute of Science.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While he did preach Vedanta philosophy, it encompassed various systems including Advaita, Visistadvaita, and Dvaita, making statement 1 somewhat misleading. His address was highly acclaimed, making statement 2 incorrect. He established the Ramakrishna Mission in 1897, not 1890, making statement 3 incorrect. Statement 4 is correct; he did inspire Tata. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) are partially or fully correct, depending on the interpretation of statement 1.

How many of the above statements are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharat Ratna is not always awarded posthumously; it is sometimes given posthumously only in exceptional cases, making statement 1 incorrect. There are no formal recommendations needed; the Prime Minister simply informs the President, making statement 2 incorrect.  The award does not include a monetary grant, making statement 3 incorrect. Statement 4 is correct; it is given for outstanding service across various fields. Therefore, only one statement (4) is correct.


**11. Consider the following regarding the Padma Awards:**

1. They were instituted in 1960.

Statement 2 is correct; they are based on write-ups from the Anubhav Portal. Statement 3 is also correct; the aim is to improve governance based on the shared experiences of retiring employees. Statement 4 is incorrect; they are awarded to retiring, not serving, employees. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are fully correct, and statement 1 is largely correct.

The Chola kings launched several naval expeditions, successfully conquering parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, demonstrating their maritime prowess.  The extensive trade networks reached far beyond the immediate region, contributing significantly to the empire's wealth and influence.  All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime dominance.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India:**

1.  It retains the traditional blindfold, symbolizing impartiality.
2.  It depicts Lady Justice in Western attire.
3.  The sword is replaced with the Indian Constitution.
4.  The scales remain, representing impartial weighing of evidence.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The new statue notably removes the blindfold, symbolizing that justice is not blind but actively sees and understands societal complexities. Statement 2 is incorrect; the statue now depicts Lady Justice in a saree, aligning with Indian traditions. Statement 3 is correct; the sword, a traditional symbol of punishment, is replaced by the Indian Constitution, highlighting the supremacy of constitutional values in Indian jurisprudence. Statement 4 is correct; the scales are retained, signifying the continued impartial weighing of evidence by the courts. Therefore, only two statements (3 and 4) are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It primarily focused on the issue of untouchability.
2.  It was solely led by Mahatma Gandhi.
3.  The Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936 was a direct outcome.
4.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker was a key supporter but disagreed with its limited success.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Vaikom Satyagraha was a significant protest against the discriminatory exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple, directly addressing the issue of untouchability. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Mahatma Gandhi supported the movement, it was primarily led by figures like T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan. Statement 3 is correct; the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, granting access to lower-caste individuals into temples, was a landmark legal victory largely influenced by the Satyagraha's impact. Statement 4 is correct; Periyar actively participated and supported the movement but was critical of its partial success (only three of the four roads leading to the temple were opened to all castes), eventually leading to his departure from the Congress.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following about the  Hindustan Republican Association (HRA):**

1.  It was primarily involved in non-violent protests against British rule.
2.  The Kakori train action was a key event in its history.
3.  It was solely led by one individual.
4.  Its activities were primarily focused on social reform rather than political action.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the HRA engaged in revolutionary activities, including the armed robbery of the Kakori train. Statement 2 is correct; the Kakori train action was a significant and defining event for the HRA. Statement 3 is incorrect; the HRA had multiple key leaders, including Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan, and Thakur Roshan Singh. Statement 4 is incorrect; while some revolutionary groups had social reform elements, the HRA was primarily focused on armed rebellion against British rule. Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are incorrect.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and its actions:**

1.  The ASI has a mandate to protect all ancient monuments regardless of their current condition or location.
2.  The delisting of monuments means they will immediately be demolished.
3.  The AMASR Act, 1958, provides the legal framework for the ASI's actions.
4.  The term "Missing Monuments" is officially used within the AMASR Act.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the ASI prioritizes monuments of national importance and may delist those deemed untraceable or lacking national significance. Statement 2 is incorrect; delisting removes ASI protection and maintenance, allowing for other activities, but doesn't mandate demolition. Statement 3 is correct; the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958, provides the legal basis for the ASI's actions, including the delisting process. Statement 4 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not an official term within the AMASR Act.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

2.  They are exclusively given to Indian citizens.
3.  They include three categories: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Padma Awards are generally not given posthumously, though exceptions exist. Statement 2 is incorrect; the awards can be given to non-Indians. Statement 3 is correct; the three categories are Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri. Statement 4 is incorrect; the award cannot be used as a suffix or prefix to the recipient's name. Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 4) are incorrect.


**6. Consider the following about the Bharat Ratna:**

1. It's awarded with a significant monetary grant.
2.  It can only be conferred on living individuals.
3.  A maximum of three awards are given each year.
4.  The design features the phrase "Satyameva Jayate."

How many of these statements are true?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Bharat Ratna does not come with a monetary grant. Statement 2 is incorrect; it can be awarded posthumously (though this wasn't initially the case). Statement 3 is partially correct; while a maximum of three is typical, exceptions have been made. Statement 4 is correct; the reverse of the medal features "Satyameva Jayate."  Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and 4) are largely true (with a nuanced understanding of statement 3).


**7. Consider the following features of the Nalanda University:**

1.  It was exclusively a Buddhist institution.
2.  It was established in the 12th century CE.
3.  Its library, "Dharma Gunj," held millions of books.

Statement 1 is incorrect; while Buddhism was prominent, Nalanda University encompassed various disciplines and philosophies. Statement 2 is incorrect; it was founded in the 5th century CE. Statement 3 is correct; its library, "Dharma Gunj," was renowned for its vast collection. Statement 4 is correct; admissions were strictly merit-based, with examinations conducted.  Therefore, three statements (3 and 4) are factually accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty was its last ruling dynasty.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked its zenith.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were solely responsible for agricultural production.
4.  Hampi is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Aravidu dynasty was the last ruling dynasty. Statement 2 is correct; Krishnadevaraya's reign is considered the empire's peak. Statement 3 is incorrect; while Amara-Nayakas had significant power, they weren't solely responsible for agriculture; the Ayagar system also played a role. Statement 4 is correct; the Hampi complex, associated with the Vijayanagara Empire, is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding Dayanand Saraswati and the Arya Samaj:**

1.  He advocated for the complete rejection of Vedic knowledge.
2.  He was against the caste system's hereditary nature.

4.  He established the Arya Samaj in Delhi.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; he advocated a return to the Vedas, not their rejection. Statement 2 is correct; he opposed the hereditary aspect of the caste system. Statement 3 is partially correct; the Shuddhi movement aimed to bring back those who converted to other religions, not to convert others to Hinduism. Statement 4 is incorrect; he established the Arya Samaj in Bombay, with the constitution finalized in Lahore. Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are incorrect.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative:**

1.  It focuses solely on training men for tourism-related roles.
2.  Its aim is to improve the tourist experience by connecting them with local ambassadors.
3.  It emphasizes the development of new tourism products.
4.  It's primarily focused on urban areas.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; it explicitly emphasizes training women and youth. Statement 2 is correct; it aims to enhance the tourist experience through local interaction. Statement 3 is correct; it focuses on developing new tourism-related products and experiences. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the text doesn't specify locations, the initiative's broad aim suggests a wider scope than just urban areas. Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.
2.  Article 49 (DPSP) of the Indian Constitution.
3.  The National Monuments Authority (NMA).
4.  The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

How many of the above are directly involved in the preservation, protection, or delisting of centrally protected monuments in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five entities play a crucial role in the management of ancient monuments in India. The AMASR Act, 1958, is the primary legislation governing the preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites. Article 49 of the Constitution directs the state to protect monuments of national importance, providing a constitutional basis for their preservation.  The NMA, established under an amendment to the AMASR Act, actively manages and protects these monuments. The ASI is the primary implementing agency responsible for the conservation and maintenance of centrally protected monuments. Finally, the Ministry of Culture's report on "untraceable" monuments directly influenced the decision to delist certain sites, demonstrating its role in the process.  Therefore, all five elements are interconnected and essential to the system of monument preservation and delisting in India.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Nalanda University Act, 2010.
2.  The 2nd East Asia Summit (EAS) in the Philippines (2007).
3.  Kumargupta I.
4.  The "Dharma Gunj" library.
5.  Disciplines like Vedas, Theravada Buddhism, and Mahayana Buddhism.

How many of the above are associated with the historical or contemporary Nalanda University?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five elements are directly linked to Nalanda University. The Nalanda University Act, 2010, is the legislation that established the modern university. The 2nd EAS in 2007 laid the groundwork for its establishment. Kumargupta I is credited with founding the ancient Nalanda University. The "Dharma Gunj" library was a significant part of the ancient university's intellectual heritage. Finally, the listed disciplines represent the diverse range of subjects taught at the ancient Nalanda University.  Therefore, all five elements are integral to understanding the history and present of Nalanda University.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Param Vir Chakra.
2.  Ashoka Chakra.
3.  Kirti Chakra.
4.  Shaurya Chakra.

How many of the above are gallantry awards conferred by the Indian government?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six awards mentioned are gallantry awards in India.  The Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are wartime gallantry awards, while the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards.  These awards recognize exceptional bravery and valor displayed by members of the armed forces and other eligible personnel.  The question includes all six, making the correct answer (d).


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  President's Gold Medals.
2.  Certificates of merit.
3.  Silver medals.

5.  Most Film-Friendly State award.

How many of the above are associated with the National Film Awards in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five options are associated with the National Film Awards, albeit in different capacities and across different years. President's Gold Medals, certificates of merit, and silver medals were presented in the earlier years of the awards. The Golden Lotus (Swarna Kamal) medallion is a significant award currently presented. The Most Film-Friendly State award is also given alongside the National Film Awards. Therefore, the correct answer is (c).


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Padma Vibhushan.
2.  Padma Bhushan.
3.  Padma Shri.
4.  Anubhav Awards.
5.  Bharat Ratna.

How many of the above are civilian awards conferred by the Indian government?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four of the listed awards are civilian awards of India: Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Bharat Ratna. The Anubhav Awards, while recognizing the contributions of retiring government employees, are not national-level civilian awards in the same category as the others. Therefore, the correct answer is (b).


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award.
2.  Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum.
3.  Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru.
4.  Miyawaki Forest.
5.  Bhujiyo Dungar hill.

How many of the above are connected to the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles Award or its recognition of Indian projects?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO's Prix Versailles Award is directly linked to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum (which was shortlisted) and the Kempegowda International Airport (which won). The Miyawaki Forest is located within the Smritivan Museum, making it indirectly connected. Bhujiyo Dungar hill is the location of the museum, also creating an indirect link. Therefore, four of the elements are connected to the award or its recognition of Indian projects.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India:**

1.  The statue depicts Lady Justice wearing a saree.
2.  The statue holds the Indian Constitution instead of a sword.

How many of these statements accurately describe the new Lady Justice statue?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe the new Lady Justice statue. The statue is depicted wearing a saree, reflecting Indian tradition.  The sword has been replaced with the Indian Constitution, symbolizing its supremacy. The eyes are open, symbolizing the law's ability to see and judge fairly, contrary to the traditional blindfolded representation. Statement 3 is incorrect; the blindfold is absent in the new statue.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  T.K. Madhavan.
2.  K.P. Kesava Menon.
3.  K. Kelappan ("Kerala Gandhi").
4.  Vaikom Satyagraha.
5.  Ezhava community.

How many of the above are associated with the Vaikom Satyagraha movement?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five elements are connected to the Vaikom Satyagraha. T.K. Madhavan, K.P. Kesava Menon, and K. Kelappan were key leaders of the movement. The Vaikom Satyagraha was the movement itself, and the Ezhava community was significantly involved in and affected by the movement's focus on temple entry.


**9. Consider the following related to the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiatives:**

1.  Focus on training women and youth.
2.  Aim to improve tourist experiences.
3.  Development of new tourism products (e.g., food tours).

How many of the above accurately reflect the goals and methods of the Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiatives?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the initiatives.  The initiatives aim to improve the tourist experience by training local people, particularly women and youth, to become ambassadors for their destinations.  The development of new tourism products and promotion of the "Incredible India" brand are key aspects. Statement 5 is incorrect; the initiatives specifically emphasize the training of women and youth.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Nagapattinam.
2.  Kandalursalai.
3.  Chola Empire.
4.  Sailendra Empire.
5.  Maldives.

How many of the above are associated with the significant naval expeditions of the Chola Empire?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nagapattinam was a key trading center of the Chola Empire. Kandalursalai was the site of a naval battle. The Chola Empire itself led the expeditions. The Sailendra Empire was a target of Chola naval conquests, and the Maldives were also conquered by the Cholas.  Therefore, all five are directly linked to the Chola naval expeditions.


**11. Consider the following:**

1.  International Register.
2.  Regional Register.
3.  National Register.
4.  UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Programme.

How many of the above are associated with UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Programme or its related activities?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International, Regional, and National Registers are all parts of the MOW Programme. The MOW Programme itself is the overall initiative. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, hosted a meeting of the MOW Committee, demonstrating its connection to the program's activities.  Therefore, all five are connected to the MOW Programme.


**12. Consider the following related to India's performance in the Olympic Games:**

1.  Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
2.  Paris 2024 Olympics.
3.  Seven medals in Tokyo.

How many of the above accurately reflect aspects of India's recent Olympic performance?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all factually related to India's Olympic performance.  India participated in the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympics.  The medal counts in those games are accurately reflected. The improved performance in other events is also mentioned in the source text.  Therefore, all five points are accurate.

How many of the above accurately reflect Swami Vivekananda's contributions and legacy?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Swami Vivekananda is known for preaching Vedanta philosophy, delivering a significant address at the World's Parliament of Religions, establishing the Ramakrishna Mission, and inspiring Jamsetji Tata.  Statement 5 is incorrect; he actively promoted a scientific temperament.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.


**14. Consider the following related to Ratan Naval Tata:**

1.  Headed the Tata Group.
2.  Launched the Tata Nano.
3.  Awarded the Padma Vibhushan.
4.  Received PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award.

How many of the above accurately reflect accomplishments under or associated with Ratan Naval Tata's leadership?

(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ratan Naval Tata headed the Tata Group, launched the Tata Nano, received the Padma Vibhushan, and received PETA India's Cow-Friendly Future Award. Statement 5 is incorrect; he headed the Tata Group, not the Reliance Group.  Therefore, four statements accurately reflect his accomplishments.


**15. Consider the following regarding the Bharat Ratna:**

1.  India's highest civilian award.
2.  Recommendations made by the President.
3.  Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) and a medallion.
4.  Comes with a significant monetary grant.
5.  Granted for outstanding service in any field.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Bharat Ratna?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharat Ratna is India's highest civilian award, recipients receive a Sanad and medallion, and it's granted for outstanding service across various fields.  However, recommendations are made by the Prime Minister, not the President, and it does not come with a monetary grant.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The oldest man-made dry-dock, dating back to 2400 BC.
2.  A prominent city of the Indus-Valley Civilization.
3.  Located between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambat.
4.  A key site for showcasing India's rich maritime heritage.

How many of the above features accurately describe Lothal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Lothal is renowned for possessing all four features listed.  It is indeed home to the oldest known man-made dry-dock, a testament to the advanced maritime technology of the Indus Valley Civilization. Its location between the Bhogavo and Sabarmati rivers near the Gulf of Khambat played a crucial role in its development as a significant port city during the Indus Valley Civilization.  The National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) being developed at Lothal aims to highlight the site's significance in India's rich maritime history, underscoring its role as a key location for showcasing this heritage. Therefore, all four statements are accurate descriptions of Lothal's attributes.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements presented in the options.


**2. Consider the following aspects of the Chola Dynasty's maritime power:**

1.  Destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  Annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
3.  Conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
4.  Establishment of a significant trading center at Madurai.

How many of the above correctly reflect the Chola Dynasty's naval expeditions and territorial expansion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Chola Dynasty's naval power is well-documented.  Rajaraja Chola's naval victories, including the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, and his conquest of parts of Sri Lanka are historically confirmed.  Rajendra Chola I extended this maritime dominance significantly, leading successful expeditions that resulted in the conquest of territories in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. However, while Madurai was an important city within the Chola empire, it wasn't primarily a key trading center in the same way Nagapattinam was. Nagapattinam played a more significant role as a major port and trading hub for the Cholas. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the dynasty's maritime prowess, while statement 4 is inaccurate regarding its primary trading center.


**3. Consider the following statements about Transhumance:**

1.  It is a traditional practice primarily associated with agricultural communities in the Gangetic plains.
2.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland is an example of transhumance.
3.  In India, it is prevalent among nomadic tribes in the Himalayas, such as the Gujars and Bakarwals.
4.  It involves the migration of livestock and human communities, but only during the summer months.

How many of the above statements accurately describe transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Transhumance is indeed a traditional practice involving the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland is a well-known example, accurately reflecting statement 2.  Statement 3 correctly highlights its prevalence among Himalayan nomadic tribes like the Gujars and Bakarwals. However, statement 1 is incorrect; transhumance is not primarily associated with agricultural communities in the Gangetic plains, and statement 4 is partially incorrect as transhumance involves seasonal movement during both summer (to higher pastures) and winter (to lower plains). Thus, only two statements accurately describe transhumance.


**4. Consider the following concerning the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.
2.  The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was held in Beijing, China.
3.  The MOW programme was launched in 1992 and maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National.
4.  The register exclusively features works from the Asia-Pacific region.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the UNESCO MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is correct, accurately stating the launch year and the three-tiered structure of the MOW registers.  The inclusion of Indian literary works like the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra in the Asia-Pacific Register is also correct, making statement 1 partially true (although the specific examples in the question are correct, the phrasing makes it seem as if only the Mahabharata and Ramayana are included). However, statement 2 is incorrect; the 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, not Beijing, China. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the register primarily focuses on the Asia-Pacific region, it does not exclusively feature works from that region. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect information about the UNESCO MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register.


**5. Consider the following about the Harappan Civilization:**

1.  It was primarily an agricultural civilization, with limited evidence of urban development.
2.  The Harappans were among the earliest to cultivate cotton.
3.  Their writing system, written in boustrophedon style, has been fully deciphered.
4.  They utilized a grid pattern in their city planning.

How many of the above statements accurately characterize the Harappan Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Harappan Civilization was indeed a sophisticated urban civilization with well-planned cities laid out in a grid pattern, making statement 4 correct. The civilization's mastery of agriculture, including the early cultivation of cotton (Sindon), is well-documented, making statement 2 also correct. However, statement 1 is incorrect, as the Harappan Civilization was characterized by significant urban development.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; although they did use a boustrophedon writing style, the Harappan script remains undeciphered. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Harappan Civilization.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor:**

1.  The agreement allows visa-free travel for all Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India.
2.  Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib is located in the Narowal district of Pakistan.
3.  The corridor agreement was initially valid for ten years.
4.  Pakistan levies a fee on each Indian pilgrim visiting Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur.


How many of the above statements are correct concerning the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Gurdwara Sri Kartarpur Sahib's location in the Narowal district of Pakistan is accurate, and a fee is indeed levied by Pakistan on each Indian pilgrim. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the agreement does *not* grant visa-free access to Pakistani Sikhs to visit Dera Baba Nanak in India. They still require an Indian visa. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the initial validity period was five years, not ten.  Therefore, only two of the statements are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The NMHC at Lothal does aim to showcase India's maritime heritage, and it includes a Lighthouse Museum and coastal state pavilions among its key projects. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NMHC is being developed under the Sagarmala Programme by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, not the Ministry of Tourism. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NMHC is being developed through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, not solely through government grants. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the NMHC.

1.  Bavikonda Monastery, known for its Theravada Buddhist complex.
2.  Salihundam, significant for its association with the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia.

4.  Thotlakonda, a major Jain pilgrimage site.

How many of the above sites are correctly associated with their respective religious traditions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Bavikonda Monastery's association with Theravada Buddhism and Salihundam's role in the spread of Buddhism to Southeast Asia are both historically accurate, making statements 1 and 2 correct. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Rottavalasa is associated with Jainism, not Hinduism.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; Thotlakonda is a significant Buddhist site, not a Jain pilgrimage site. Therefore, only two of the statements correctly link the sites to their religious traditions.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Kalinga Dynasty?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. The Kalinga War did lead to the Maurya Empire's annexation of Kalinga, and the Kalinga Dynasty's territory encompassed modern-day Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh.  Statement 2 is partially correct; Kharavela was a significant ruler, and he did patronize the construction of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves; however, his patronage was primarily directed towards Jainism, not Buddhism. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Hathigumpha inscription details the reign of Kharavela, not Chandragupta Maurya.  Chandragupta Maurya was a Mauryan emperor, not a ruler of the Kalinga Dynasty.  Therefore, three statements correctly describe aspects of the Kalinga Dynasty.


**10. Consider the following about Neolithic age rock carvings:**

1.  The Archaeological Survey of India has confirmed Neolithic age rock carvings in Goa's Mauxi village.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is entirely correct. The Archaeological Survey of India has indeed confirmed the presence of Neolithic age rock carvings in Goa's Mauxi village. However, statement 2 is partially incorrect; while some geometric patterns might be present, the carvings primarily depict animals. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the carvings are etched into meta basalt rock, not granite.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the carvings are located near the Zarme River, not the Zuari River. Therefore, only one statement provides an accurate description of the Neolithic rock carvings found in Goa.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval conquest of Sri Lanka.
2.  Rajendra I's expedition against the Sailendra Empire.
3.  The Chola Empire's flourishing trade with Southeast Asia.

How many of the above accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's maritime power and influence?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements accurately describe facets of the Chola Empire's maritime dominance. Rajaraja I significantly expanded Chola control over Sri Lanka through naval power, making it a Chola province.  Rajendra I extended Chola influence further by leading a major naval expedition against the Sailendra Empire in Southeast Asia, conquering regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  This naval prowess facilitated flourishing trade with Southeast Asian countries, a key component of the Chola's "Look East Policy." Nagapattinam served as a crucial port city, highlighting the importance of maritime trade in the Chola economy and its extensive network of trade connections.  Therefore, all four elements are integral to understanding the Chola Empire's maritime capabilities and reach.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 accurately defines transhumance as the seasonal movement of livestock. Statement 3 correctly notes the 2023 UNESCO recognition of transhumance traditions. Statement 4 is also accurate, as transhumance involves the movement of human communities along with their herds.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, it's not exclusively practiced there; it also exists in various plains regions of India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 provide a complete and accurate description of transhumance.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The register did include manuscripts of three Indian literary works: Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana. The 10th meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP) was indeed held in Ulaanbaatar.  The MoW program's goal is to preserve documentary heritage globally. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The MoW program has three registers: International, Regional, and National. Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is entirely correct. The Flag Code mandates a rectangular flag with a 3:2 length-to-height ratio.  Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. The Flag Code governs the display of the National flag by private, public, and government institutions.  Amendments allow for machine-made flags and materials beyond hand-spun and hand-woven cotton (including polyester, wool, silk, and Ichadi bunting).  The 2022 amendment allows for display of the National flag at home on all days and nights.  Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the amended Flag Code.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The ICC launched the T20 World Cup in 2007, and it's a 20-over-per-team format.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; India won the tournament for the *second* time (not the first). Statement 2 is also incorrect; the final was held in the USA and West Indies, not Australia.  Therefore, only three of the four statements accurately describe the 2024 T20 World Cup.

How many of these statements correctly describe the NMHC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Explanation:** Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. The NMHC does indeed include a lighthouse museum and coastal state pavilions as key projects.  Furthermore, it accurately reflects upon the maritime trade links of the Indus Valley Civilization, showcasing India's long and rich maritime history. However, statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. The NMHC's scope encompasses India's maritime heritage across various historical periods, not just the colonial era.  It also covers various dynasties and periods beyond the Mughal Empire.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the NMHC's focus and projects.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct descriptions of the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. The sun's rays directly hit the Tropic of Cancer, and locations beyond the Arctic Circle experience continuous daylight.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun during the Summer Solstice, not the Southern Hemisphere. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it's the *longest* day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the Northern Hemisphere's Summer Solstice.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Sahitya Akademi Fellowship is indeed the highest honor, and Ruskin Bond is a recipient. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the fellowship is not awarded annually to multiple writers; it is reserved for only a select few eminent writers.

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Ministry of Culture, in association with the IBC, observes IAD. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya marks the event.  The recent declaration of Pali as a classical language is also celebrated during IAD. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Buddha descended to Sankassiya (now Sankisa Basantapur), not Lumbini. Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate regarding IAD.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles.

The award isn't limited to France; it's an international award recognizing projects globally.  The award's scope also goes beyond sustainable infrastructure; it considers projects with broader impacts on the built environment and quality of life.  Therefore, only two statements accurately depict the UNESCO’s Prix Versailles.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The depiction of Lady Justice draws inspiration from Greek and Roman mythology, not solely Indian mythology, making statement 1 incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct; Lady Justice traditionally holds scales representing balance and a sword representing authority. Statement 4 is correct; the addition of the blindfold to the statue's depiction is associated with the Renaissance period. Therefore, three of the statements accurately reflect aspects of the Lady Justice statue.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's economic activities:**

1. Nagapattinam served as a major port city facilitating extensive maritime trade.
2. The Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal significantly hampered trade with Southeast Asia.
3. Rajaraja I and Rajendra I's naval expeditions primarily aimed at cultural exchange rather than economic expansion.

How many of the above statements are factually incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nagapattinam was a crucial trading center for the Chola Empire, connecting them to extensive trade networks in Southeast Asia and beyond.  Its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure facilitated the flourishing maritime trade that characterized the Chola economy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chola navy's dominance in the Bay of Bengal, far from hindering trade, actually *protected* and facilitated it.  Control of the sea lanes allowed for safe passage of Chola merchant vessels and ensured the flow of goods and resources. This maritime power was instrumental in the Chola Empire's economic prosperity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While cultural exchange may have been a byproduct, the naval expeditions of Rajaraja I and Rajendra I were fundamentally driven by economic motivations.  Conquests brought access to resources, new markets, and tribute, significantly enriching the Chola treasury and expanding their economic influence.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The conquests of Rajendra I in Southeast Asia significantly expanded the Chola Empire's trade network.  These newly acquired territories provided access to valuable resources and new trade routes, bolstering the Chola economy and strengthening its position in the region.

Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are factually incorrect.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While preserving documentary heritage is a core function, the MOW Programme's scope extends beyond ancient manuscripts to encompass various forms of documentary heritage, including archives, photographs, films, and other significant records.

Statement 2 is correct. The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, as its name suggests, exclusively features works from the Asia-Pacific region. This regional focus allows for more targeted preservation efforts and facilitates collaboration within the geographic area.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ramcharitmanas is indeed among the Indian literary works included in the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register, reflecting its significant cultural and historical importance.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The MOW Programme maintains three registers: International, Regional, and National. This tiered structure allows for a more comprehensive approach to preserving documentary heritage at different levels, from global to national contexts.

Therefore, statements 1, 4 are inaccurate.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The RESET Programme is designed to empower retired sportspersons (aged 20-50) with skills for career development and increased employability, irrespective of their Olympic participation.  It covers a broader range of retired athletes.

This emphasizes the economic benefits derived from the empire's naval control. The Chola navy's dominance over the Bay of Bengal, effectively transforming it into a "Chola lake," facilitated extensive trade with Southeast Asian countries, showcasing the empire's influence on regional commerce.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. The temple is located on the Nilachal hills, the Ambubachi Mela does celebrate the goddess's menstruation, and it is indeed one of the 51 Shakti Peethas. Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. The original temple was destroyed, and the mid-16th-century reconstruction was by the Koch dynasty, not the Pala dynasty.  Furthermore, the temple's architecture is a blend of styles (Nilachal, Upper Burma, Pala, and Ahom), not solely Nilachal. This question requires a nuanced understanding of the temple's history, geography, and architectural features, testing both factual recall and the ability to differentiate between accurate and partially true statements.  The incorrect statements regarding the dynasty and architectural style act as strong distractors.

(d) Four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 are correct. The civilization did use standardized weights and measures, was referred to as Meluha, and imported copper.  Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. While Pasupati was a deity, no dedicated temples have been discovered.  Also, the Indus script remains undeciphered.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Eri silk?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of Eri silk. *Philosamia ricini* is indeed the silkworm species that produces Eri silk.  The unique characteristic of Eri silk is that it's considered vegan because the moth is allowed to exit the cocoon naturally, unlike other silk production methods where the moth is killed.  The multivoltine nature of the silkworm allows for indoor rearing 5-6 times a year, contributing to its sustainable production. Statement 4 is incorrect; the process specifically avoids killing the moth, which is a key feature differentiating it from other types of silk.  Therefore, only three statements correctly describe Eri silk.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.

The Ahom political system was unique, with significant power residing in the council of ministers despite the existence of a king.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Ahoms did patronize religious institutions, they are primarily known for their patronage of Shaivism and the Shakti movement, not Buddhism.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; although internal conflicts played a role, the primary cause of the Ahom dynasty's downfall was the Burmese invasion and subsequent annexation by the British East India Company. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative aims to improve the global standing of Indian cotton through branding, traceability, and certification.  Blockchain technology is a core component of its traceability system. TEXPROCIL serves as the implementing agency. Statement 2 is incorrect; the initiative involves a joint effort by the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, various trade bodies, and the industry itself, highlighting public-private collaboration.  Thus, three statements correctly represent the initiative.

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Project PARI aims to make art more accessible to the public through installations in urban spaces. The project includes various traditional Indian art forms, including Thangka painting. Statement 1 is incorrect; while Lalit Kala Akademi is involved, the National Gallery of Modern Art, not the National Museum of Modern Art, is a partner in the execution. Statement 4 is incorrect; the first intervention took place in Delhi, not Mumbai.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Yusuf Dadoo played a significant role in the South African Communist Party and anti-apartheid movements. India was indeed the first country to sever trade relations with the apartheid regime. Statement 1 is incorrect; Gandhi's efforts were crucial, but he established the Natal Indian Congress, not the ANC. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UN's involvement was prompted by the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, not the Group Areas Act. Therefore, only two statements are correct.

Statement 3 is incorrect; the Hire Benkal site is on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status but hasn't yet been designated.  Statement 4 is also partially incorrect, as some megaliths may have had other functions besides burial, but burial is the main association.  Therefore, only two statements are partially correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Chola Empire engaged in significant naval conflicts and expansions against the Chera dynasty (at Kandalursalai), the Sailendra Empire (in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra), and Sri Lanka (resulting in annexation of its northern parts).  The Maldives were also conquered by the Cholas.  While the Sailendra Empire itself had naval power, it was a target of Chola expansionism.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. It resulted in the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.
2. It directly led to the establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission.

4. It achieved complete success in opening all access routes to the temple.

How many of the statements accurately reflect the outcomes or consequences of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Vaikom Satyagraha led to the Temple Entry Proclamation, granting lower-caste individuals access to temples, and significantly strained relations between Gandhi and Periyar due to differing interpretations of the movement's goals and achievements. However, the Satyagraha didn't directly lead to the establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission, and it only partially succeeded in opening access routes to the temple (3 out of 4 roads).


**6. Consider the following:**

1. The Kakori Train Action
2. The Hindustan Republican Association (HRA)
3. Ram Prasad Bismil
4. The Santhal Rebellion

How many of the above are directly associated with the Indian independence movement's revolutionary phase?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Kakori Train Action was a significant event carried out by the HRA, a revolutionary organization. Ram Prasad Bismil was a key figure in this action.  While the Santhal Rebellion was a significant uprising, it predates the organized revolutionary phase of the Indian independence movement and had different causes and objectives.  Therefore, only three of the listed items are directly related to the movement's revolutionary phase.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Nalanda University Act, 2010
2. The East Asia Summit (EAS)
3.  The UNESCO World Heritage Site designation for Nalanda ruins

The UNESCO designation recognizes the historical importance of the Nalanda ruins.  The destruction by Bakhtiyar Khalji marks a pivotal point in the university's history. Therefore, all four points are directly related to Nalanda's significance.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat
2. Project PARI (Public Art of India)
3. Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi Initiative
4. The Swadesh Darshan Scheme

How many of the above are government initiatives focused on promoting specific aspects of Indian culture, heritage, or tourism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Kasturi Cotton Bharat focuses on promoting Indian cotton, Project PARI promotes public art, and Paryatan Mitra/Didi aims to enhance tourism. The Swadesh Darshan scheme, while related to tourism, is broader, focusing on developing thematic circuits across India, not a single initiative. Therefore, three are directly focused on promoting specific cultural, heritage, or tourism aspects.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The Odisha Famine of 1866
2.  The Battle of Saragarhi, 1897
3.  The Santhal Rebellion

How many of the above represent significant historical events in India, each with distinct socio-political or military contexts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Odisha famine highlights British administrative failures, the Battle of Saragarhi showcases Sikh bravery, the Santhal Rebellion represents tribal resistance, and the Vaikom Satyagraha symbolizes the anti-caste movement. Each event holds distinct historical significance and falls under separate socio-political or military contexts.  Therefore, all four are significant historical events in India.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Ramcharitmanas
2.  Panchatantra
3.  Sahṛdayāloka-Locana
4.  The Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register

How many of the above are directly associated with the preservation or recognition of significant Indian literary works?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are all significant Indian literary works.  The MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register is the mechanism through which these works (and others) are recognized and preserved for their documentary heritage value. Therefore, three are directly associated with preservation or recognition of Indian literary works.

Statement 3 is correct: Rajendra I's expeditions reached the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. Statement 4 is incorrect: The Cholas were known for their powerful navy and extensive naval expeditions. Therefore, three statements are correct.

3. Tuluva Dynasty
4. Bahmani Dynasty

How many of the above dynasties ruled the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Vijayanagara Empire was ruled by four major dynasties: Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva, and Aravidu.  The Bahmani dynasty was a contemporary kingdom, a rival power in the Deccan region, but not a ruling dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire itself. Therefore, only three of the listed dynasties ruled the Vijayanagara Empire. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either underestimate or overestimate the number of Vijayanagara ruling dynasties.  The question tests factual recall about the historical sequence and the names of the dynasties that ruled this significant South Indian kingdom.  Understanding the political landscape of the Deccan requires knowledge of these dynasties and their relative timelines.


**2. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire's administration:**

1.  The Amara-Nayaka system, where military commanders were given territories to govern.
2.  The Ayagar system, where twelve functionaries were appointed in each village.
3.  The establishment of a centralized bureaucracy under the direct control of the emperor.
4.  The use of a highly sophisticated, unified legal code applicable across the entire empire.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Vijayanagara Empire's administrative structure?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Amara-Nayaka system and the Ayagar system were indeed integral parts of the Vijayanagara administrative structure. The Amara-Nayakas, while powerful regional governors, operated within a framework of overall imperial authority. The Ayagar system provided a village-level administrative framework. However, the empire did not have a fully centralized bureaucracy under direct imperial control.  Nor did it utilize a single, unified legal code throughout its vast territory.  The decentralized nature of the administration, using regional governors with considerable autonomy, is a key feature to understand. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include features that were not characteristic of the Vijayanagara administrative system, showcasing a potential misconception about the extent of centralization in the empire.


**3. Consider the following about the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1.  Rajaraja Chola's naval forces destroyed the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  Rajendra Chola I's conquest extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3.  The Chola navy played a negligible role in the empire's expansion.
4.  Chola naval power was primarily focused on coastal defense rather than overseas conquest.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Chola Empire's naval activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Rajaraja Chola's naval victories, including the destruction of the Chera navy (not Pandya), and Rajendra Chola I's significant overseas expeditions to Southeast Asia are well-documented.  Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. The Chola navy was instrumental in the empire's expansion, projecting power far beyond the Indian subcontinent. The question tests the knowledge of Chola naval power and its role in shaping the empire's reach. The inclusion of plausible distractors highlights the need for precise factual recall.  Understanding the scope of Chola power requires analyzing their naval capabilities.


**4. Consider the following concerning the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It was a movement primarily focused on securing temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.
2.  Mahatma Gandhi actively participated in the initial stages of the Satyagraha.
3.  The Satyagraha resulted in the immediate and complete removal of all restrictions on temple entry.
4.  Periyar E.V. Ramasamy Naicker played a significant role in mobilizing support for the movement.


Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a pivotal moment in the fight against caste discrimination, primarily focusing on temple entry for lower-caste Hindus.  Gandhi's support, while significant, was not continuous throughout the entire duration.  The Satyagraha's outcome was not an immediate and complete removal of all restrictions; it was a partial success, paving the way for further reforms. Periyar's role in the mobilization and leadership of the Satyagraha is well-established. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly portray the nuances of the movement's timeline, impact, and leadership, testing the candidate's understanding of historical processes and the complexities of social reform movements.


**5. Consider the following about the literary works included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The *Ramcharitmanas* is a 16th-century epic poem written in Sanskrit.
2.  The *Panchatantra* is a collection of fables, known for its "story within a story" structure.
3.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is a text on Indian poetics, with a commentary by Abhinavagupta.
4.  All three works were written in the same language.

How many of the above statements are correct about the literary works mentioned?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The *Panchatantra* is accurately described as a collection of fables with the characteristic nested narrative structure.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, a text on poetics with Abhinavagupta's commentary, is also correctly described. However, the *Ramcharitmanas* was written in Awadhi, not Sanskrit.  The three works were not written in the same language. The question tests the factual recall of specific details related to important Indian literary works and their inclusion in a prestigious international register, demanding precise knowledge of the texts and their authors.  The inclusion of a distractor about the language of the *Ramcharitmanas* increases the difficulty level.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1.  The INSTC is a primarily land-based transport route.
2.  The INSTC significantly reduces transport time and cost between India and Russia.
3.  The INSTC involves the participation of Iran and Armenia.
4.  The INSTC primarily focuses on the transportation of oil and gas.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the INSTC?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The INSTC is a multimodal transport corridor, utilizing both land and sea routes. While it aims to improve connectivity between India and Central Asia and beyond, the primary focus is not solely on oil and gas transportation. The INSTC does include Iran and Armenia as participating countries.  The reduction of transit time and cost is a major goal. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the INSTC's route, participants, and goals, incorporating plausible distractors to enhance difficulty.  A grasp of international trade routes and geopolitical dynamics is required to answer this question correctly.  The question requires a nuanced understanding of the INSTC's purpose and scope.


**7. Consider the following personalities associated with the  Ramakrishna Mission:**

1.  Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
2.  Swami Vivekananda
3.  Sri Aurobindo
4.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy

How many of the above individuals were directly involved in the establishment or early development of the Ramakrishna Mission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the spiritual teacher, and Swami Vivekananda, his chief disciple who played a pivotal role in spreading Vedanta philosophy globally, were directly involved in the founding and early growth of the Ramakrishna Mission.  Sri Aurobindo and Raja Ram Mohan Roy, while influential figures in Indian spiritual and social reform movements, were not directly associated with the Ramakrishna Mission. The question tests factual recall regarding important personalities in Indian religious and philosophical history. The inclusion of plausible distractors challenges the examinee to differentiate between figures who were directly involved and those who were influential in related movements.  It demands precise knowledge of the Ramakrishna Mission's history and key players.


**8. Consider the following statements about the  Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative:**

1.  It aims to enhance the global competitiveness of Indian cotton.
2.  It utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.
3.  It is solely a government-led initiative, without any private sector participation.
4.  Its main objective is to increase cotton production by expanding cultivation area.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative indeed aims to improve the global competitiveness of Indian cotton by focusing on quality, traceability, and certification. The use of blockchain technology for ensuring traceability is a core feature of the initiative. However, it's a joint initiative involving the government, the Cotton Corporation of India, and industry stakeholders, not solely a government-led effort.  Increasing cotton production through expanding cultivation is not the primary goal, focusing more on improving the quality and value of existing production. The question tests the knowledge of government initiatives aimed at improving the quality and market reach of Indian agricultural products.  The inclusion of plausible distractors necessitates careful analysis of the program's aims and implementation.  It requires an understanding of the role of technology and collaboration in agricultural development.

4.  Awardees receive a monetary prize in addition to a medal and certificate.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the PMRBP?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The PMRBP is indeed awarded annually to children aged 5-18, recognizing achievements across multiple categories.  It is widely considered the highest civilian honor for children in India. However, the award does not include a monetary prize; awardees receive a medal, certificate, and a citation booklet.  The question tests the knowledge of national-level awards and recognition programs for children, demanding precise knowledge of the award's components.  The inclusion of a distractor regarding the monetary prize enhances the difficulty level.  It requires understanding the nature of such awards and their significance in recognizing exceptional talent.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Archaeological Survey of India (ASI):**

1.  It is responsible for the protection and preservation of ancient monuments and archaeological sites in India.
2.  It coordinates the recovery of traced antiquities.

4.  It is solely responsible for the enforcement of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities of the ASI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The ASI is indeed responsible for the protection and preservation of ancient monuments and sites in India and plays a key role in coordinating the recovery of traced antiquities.  However, it does not have exclusive control over all excavation and exploration activities; other organizations and institutions are also involved.  While the ASI is heavily involved in the enforcement of the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972, it is not solely responsible; other agencies also play a role. The question tests knowledge of the organization's functions and responsibilities in the field of archaeology and heritage preservation.  The inclusion of distractors requires careful evaluation of the ASI's role in relation to other agencies and institutions. It demands a nuanced understanding of the organizational structure and its responsibilities in the field of archaeology.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Miyawaki method (1) is a reforestation technique focused on environmental restoration and biodiversity, making it directly relevant to environmental initiatives. The Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum (3) incorporates a large Miyawaki forest, further highlighting its environmental significance. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake (4) was a major natural event that caused significant environmental impact and prompted initiatives like the Smritivan museum.  While the Kempegowda International Airport's (2) award acknowledges architectural beauty and sustainability, its primary focus isn't directly on environmental conservation in the same way as the other options. Therefore, options (1), (3), and (4) are all directly associated with environmental initiatives or significant natural events in India.

How many of the above awards or designations recognize achievements in fields outside of the purely cinematic arts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) (2) recognizes cities for their contributions to various creative fields, including crafts and folk arts. The World Craft City (WCC) designation (3) specifically focuses on craft traditions, falling outside the scope of cinema. The Prix Versailles (4) is awarded for architectural excellence, another field distinct from cinema. Only the Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1) is exclusively dedicated to cinema. Therefore, three of the listed awards or designations recognize achievements outside the purely cinematic arts.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Kashi Vishwanath Corridor (1) is a significant project enhancing religious tourism infrastructure by improving access to a major Hindu pilgrimage site.  The Mahakal Lok Corridor (2) also falls under this category, focusing on the development of a religious site and boosting tourism. The Vishnupad Temple (3) is a significant Hindu pilgrimage site in itself. The Mahabodhi Temple Complex (4), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a major Buddhist pilgrimage site, thereby fitting the criteria.  All four options represent pilgrimage sites or projects directly related to the development of religious tourism infrastructure in India.

They also domesticated a range of animals, including oxen, buffaloes, and camels (2).  Their unique pictographic script (3) has not yet been deciphered, representing a significant mystery of the civilization. Archaeological evidence, including Mesopotamian records, confirms extensive trade networks connecting the Harappan Civilization to Mesopotamia, with the Indus region referred to as Meluha (4).  All four statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Harappan Civilization.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kozhikode's designation as the "City of Literature" (1) is a cultural recognition highlighting its literary heritage. Srinagar's recognition as a World Craft City (2) is an economic and cultural recognition, celebrating its craft traditions and boosting its tourism.  The prior designations of Jaipur, Malappuram, and Mysore as World Craft Cities (3) further highlight this type of recognition. Kozhikode's robust literary foundation (4) contributes to its cultural identity and economic potential through tourism and related industries.  All four statements directly relate to cultural or economic recognition of Indian cities.

How many of the above initiatives are directly related to promoting Indian heritage, culture, or tourism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Kasturi Cotton Bharat (1), while focused on the cotton industry, indirectly supports Indian heritage by promoting a uniquely Indian product with a strong emphasis on quality and traceability. Project PARI (2) directly promotes Indian art and culture through public installations. Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi (3) are explicitly designed to promote responsible tourism. The development of the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal (4) directly showcases India's rich maritime heritage.  All four initiatives are directly or indirectly related to promoting Indian heritage, culture, or tourism.

4. The movement lasted for over two years.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one  
(b) Only two  
(c) Only three  
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate. While the Vaikom Satyagraha involved Hindu reform, Periyar's participation highlights its broader anti-caste dimensions. He viewed it as a fight against caste-based atrocities, not just a Hindu reformist movement.  This reveals a critical divergence of perspectives on the movement's core aims.

Statement 2 is partially true. The primary goal was temple entry for lower castes, but the movement's success was limited, with only three of the four roads leading to the temple opened to all castes. This partial success contributed to Periyar's dissatisfaction.

Statement 3 is correct. Periyar played a significant role in mobilizing volunteers and garnering public support. His arrest and imprisonment underscore his commitment. His dissatisfaction with the partial victory led him to leave the Congress.

Statement 4 is correct. The Vaikom Satyagraha lasted 604 days, significantly longer than two years.  The duration reflects the prolonged struggle against entrenched social and political opposition.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is also correct. The robbery aimed to secure funds for the HRA's revolutionary activities against the British Raj. This demonstrates the group's resourcefulness and commitment to their cause.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kakori Train Robbery occurred in 1925, not 1926. This factual inaccuracy is a crucial distinction for historical accuracy.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Mahatma Gandhi did not support the HRA's violent revolutionary tactics.  His philosophy of non-violent resistance starkly contrasted with the HRA's approach.  This demonstrates a fundamental ideological difference between the two prominent figures of the Indian independence movement.


**3. Consider the following personalities associated with anti-caste movements in India:**

1. Jyotirao Phule

B.R. Ambedkar's work with the Depressed Classes movement and his advocacy for social justice and eradication of untouchability are well-documented.  He championed the rights of the marginalized and fought against discrimination.

E.V. Ramasamy Naicker (Periyar) led the Self-Respect Movement, explicitly targeting the caste system and Brahminical hegemony. His efforts to dismantle caste-based social structures were significant.

Gopal Krishna Gokhale, while a prominent social reformer, focused primarily on constitutional methods and didn't directly lead movements explicitly challenging the caste system in the same way as Phule, Ambedkar, and Periyar. His approach differed in its methods and focus.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The temple is dedicated to a trinity: Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra, and Lord Balabhadra.  The inclusion of multiple deities is a significant aspect of the temple's religious significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The temple's architectural style is Kalinga, a distinct sub-style within Nagara, not Dravidian.  This highlights the regional variations in temple architecture.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ratna Bhandar, the temple's treasury, indeed contains valuable jewels associated with the deities. This underscores the temple's historical wealth and importance.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The temple was built during the reign of Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Ganga dynasty, not a Chola king.  This clarifies the temple's historical context and its association with a specific dynasty.

Statement 2 is also correct. Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu were prominent leaders of the Santhal Rebellion. Their leadership was crucial in mobilizing the Santhal community.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The rebellion occurred in present-day Jharkhand and West Bengal, not Bihar and Odisha.  Accurate geographical identification is crucial for understanding the rebellion's context.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act was enacted *after* the rebellion, as a response to it.  This demonstrates the British response to the uprising and attempts to address some of the underlying issues.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are accurate representations of the Chola Empire's significant naval achievements.  Rajaraja I, a prominent Chola ruler, significantly expanded the empire's maritime power.  His naval forces achieved a decisive victory against the Chera navy at Kandalursalai, demonstrating their dominance in the region.  This victory solidified Chola control over crucial sea lanes and trade routes.  Similarly, Rajendra I, the successor to Rajaraja I, continued this naval prowess. His campaigns culminated in the complete conquest of Sri Lanka, transforming it into a Chola province.  This illustrates the Chola navy's ability to conduct large-scale military operations across significant distances.  Finally, Rajendra I's expeditions extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the remarkable reach and capabilities of the Chola navy. This far-reaching expansion highlights the Chola Empire's influence not just regionally, but also across the Indian Ocean, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of naval strategy and logistics.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d), encompassing all three aspects of Chola naval expansion.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to recognize the full extent of the Chola Empire's naval dominance.

Statement 1 correctly identifies ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) as the lead organization behind the initiative, supported by Azerbaijan.  Statement 2 accurately defines transhumance as the traditional practice of seasonal movement of livestock, often involving the migration of human communities alongside their herds. This practice is a significant aspect of many cultures and ecosystems globally, contributing to both cultural heritage and ecological balance. Statement 3 is also correct. In 2023, UNESCO did indeed recognize two distinct transhumance traditions – one encompassing ten European states and another focused on the Alpine pastures of Switzerland – as Intangible Cultural Heritage. This recognition underscores the importance of preserving these traditional practices and the associated cultural knowledge. Therefore, the correct answer is (c), as all three statements are accurate and reflect different facets of the transhumance initiative and concept.

(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

All three statements accurately reflect key features of the Harappan Civilization. The use of standardized weights and measures is strong evidence of a well-organized and extensive trade network across the Indus Valley and beyond.  This system facilitated efficient exchange of goods and services, contributing to the economic prosperity of the civilization. The discovery of the bearded male figure in Mohenjo-daro, often interpreted as a priest-king or religious figure, points to a sophisticated social hierarchy and a developed religious system. This artifact provides valuable insights into Harappan societal structures and beliefs.  Furthermore, the Harappan civilization possessed a unique pictographic writing system, written in a boustrophedon style (alternating left-to-right and right-to-left). Although this script remains undeciphered, its existence demonstrates a high level of cultural and intellectual development.  The fact that it hasn't been deciphered doesn't diminish its significance as a hallmark of the civilization.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c) because all three mentioned features are well-established characteristics of the Harappan Civilization.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe key aspects of the Charaideo Moidams.

This comparison highlights their monumental nature and the advanced construction techniques employed.  The Moidams served as the necropolis for the Tai-Ahom dynasty, reflecting their importance in Ahom culture and history. The burial practices and associated rituals demonstrate a rich and complex cultural heritage.  The inscription of the Charaideo Moidams on the UNESCO World Heritage List was a landmark event, marking the first time a site from North-East India received recognition under the Cultural Category. This recognition underscores the global significance of the Moidams and the unique cultural heritage they represent.

How many of the above features are considered integral parts of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly identify key features of the Mahabodhi Temple Complex.  The main temple's architectural style, characterized by its curvilinear shikhara (tower), is a prominent aspect of its design. This architectural style reflects the influence of classical Indian temple architecture, contributing to the temple's visual appeal and historical significance.  The Vajrasana, or Diamond Throne, is a central feature of the complex, marking the exact spot where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. This makes it a place of immense religious significance for Buddhists worldwide. The sacred Bodhi Tree, a direct descendant of the original tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment, holds deep spiritual importance for Buddhists.  Its presence within the complex adds to its sacred aura and attracts pilgrims from across the globe.  Therefore, all three features are integral and accurately described, making (c) the correct answer.


7. Consider the following statements regarding the Sangameshwar Temple:

1. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and located at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers.
2.  Annual flooding from the Srisailam dam submerges the temple.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the Sangameshwar Temple in Nandyal district, Andhra Pradesh. The temple is indeed dedicated to Lord Shiva and is situated at the confluence of the Krishna and Bhavanasi rivers, a location of significant religious importance. The temple's location at the confluence of these rivers is a key aspect of its religious significance. The annual flooding caused by the Srisailam dam's backwaters is a recurring event, highlighting the temple's vulnerability to environmental factors.  This creates a unique challenge for preserving the temple and its surroundings. Finally, the existence of other temples with the name "Sangameshwar" in various parts of India, including Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, is also a well-established fact. This reflects the widespread worship of Lord Shiva and the variations in regional temple architecture and traditions.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as all three statements are factually accurate.


8. Consider the following regarding the Ahom Dynasty in Assam:

1. The dynasty's origins trace back to a Shan prince from Mong Mao.
2.  The Ahom kings wielded absolute power, unconstrained by any council or advisory body.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ahom Dynasty?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Two of the statements are accurate, while one is not.  Statement 1 correctly points to the Ahom dynasty's origins with Sukaphaa, a Shan prince from Mong Mao, who migrated to Assam across the Patkai Mountains. This migration marked the beginning of the Ahom rule in Assam, influencing its culture and political landscape. Statement 3 is also accurate. The Ahom rulers adopted Shaivism and the Shakti movement, significantly impacting the religious landscape of Assam.  They constructed numerous temples dedicated to these deities, showcasing their patronage of religious practices. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Ahom kings held significant power, their authority was not absolute.  They were significantly influenced by a powerful council of ministers. The king's decisions often required the concurrence of the "Patra Mantris," indicating a system of checks and balances within the monarchy. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making (b) the right answer.

3. The Kalinga dynasty ruled only over present-day Odisha.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Kalinga Dynasty and its historical context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of the Kalinga Dynasty. The Kalinga War (261 BCE) between the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka and the Kalinga kingdom is historically significant for Ashoka's subsequent conversion to Buddhism, profoundly impacting his reign and the spread of Buddhism. Kharavela, a key ruler of the Kalinga dynasty (though not strictly from the same dynasty as the Kalinga War), is renowned for his patronage of Jainism. The Hathigumpha inscription, carved on the Kumari mountain range, provides crucial details about his reign and achievements, offering valuable insights into the dynasty's history. However, statement 3 is inaccurate. The Kalinga dynasty's territory extended beyond present-day Odisha, encompassing parts of Andhra Pradesh as well. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct, making (b) the correct option.

Megalithic burials are indeed primarily associated with the Neolithic-Chalcolithic period, representing a significant cultural development. The presence of megalithic structures and associated artifacts provides valuable evidence for understanding the social and religious practices of these early societies.  The general association of Megalithic burials with iron, although not universally true, is a common feature in many regions.  The use of iron tools and weapons in these periods often coincides with the construction of these monumental burial sites. Finally, the grave goods and pottery offerings found within these burial sites provide valuable insights into the beliefs about death and the afterlife held by the people of those times. These offerings often include personal items, tools, and food, suggesting beliefs about the continuation of life beyond death.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as all three statements accurately reflect characteristics of Megalithic burial practices.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements correctly describe elements of the Chola Empire's naval prowess and its consequences.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Each initiative listed directly relates to the preservation, promotion, or recognition of India's cultural heritage. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative highlights the importance of traditional practices. The inclusion of Indian literary works in UNESCO's MOW Register acknowledges their significance in world literature. Project PARI actively promotes the visual arts and diverse artistic traditions, while the granting of GI tags protects and promotes specific regional products, which are often tied to unique cultural identities and traditions.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Three of the initiatives directly relate to either economic development or national identity. Kasturi Cotton Bharat focuses on improving the economic competitiveness of Indian cotton in global markets. The Paryatan Mitra and Paryatan Didi initiative aims to boost tourism, which has significant economic implications. The delisting of monuments, while potentially impacting cultural preservation, is primarily a decision based on an assessment of national importance.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power.  The Chola navy controlled the Bay of Bengal, facilitating trade and projecting power. Nagapattinam was a crucial port city for this maritime trade, connecting them to Southeast Asia. Rajendra I significantly expanded Chola influence through naval expeditions reaching the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while Rajaraja I was a powerful ruler, his military policies included significant naval components, as evidenced by his conquests and naval dominance.  The "Chola Lake" designation highlights their naval control of the Bay of Bengal, a crucial aspect of their maritime power and trade networks.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the delisting of centrally protected monuments in India:**

(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kos Minar monuments are indeed among those facing delisting due to being "untraceable," demonstrating the practical application of delisting procedures.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the ASI considers multiple factors beyond historical significance, including the practicality of conservation and the monument's current condition. Statement 2 is incorrect; the term "Missing Monuments" is not officially defined within the AMASR Act; it's a term used in CAG audit reports.  Therefore, only two statements accurately represent the situation.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Rajaraja I's aggressive military strategies, including naval campaigns, led to territorial expansion. Nagapattinam was indeed a vital port city, crucial for their maritime trade.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Cholas faced naval conflicts, the battle at Kandalursalai did not signify the end of their naval dominance.

The question tests knowledge of the structure and functioning of a significant Indian institution.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the delisting of centrally protected monuments in India:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its delisting decisions solely on the "untraceable" status of a monument.
2.  Delisting a monument under the AMASR Act, 1958, automatically removes all legal protection afforded to it.
3.  The term "Missing Monuments" is officially recognized within the AMASR Act as a criterion for delisting.
4. Article 49 of the Indian Constitution mandates the state to protect all ancient monuments regardless of their current status.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ASI's recent delisting initiative focused on "untraceable" monuments, the decision also considers whether a monument lacks national importance.  Delisting isn't solely based on the inability to locate a site.  The assessment involves a broader evaluation of its historical and cultural significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Delisting under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, removes ASI's conservation, protection, and maintenance responsibilities. However, it doesn't automatically void all legal protections. Other laws and regulations might still apply, depending on the monument's location and other attributes.  The removal of ASI oversight doesn't equate to complete legal deregulation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The term "Missing Monuments" isn't an official term within the AMASR Act. It emerged from a CAG audit report, representing an informal descriptor rather than a legally defined category for delisting.  The Act uses precise legal terminology, and this casual term isn't part of that framework.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While Article 49 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to protect monuments and objects of national importance, it doesn't mandate protection for *all* ancient monuments unconditionally. The state's responsibility is focused on those deemed of national importance, a determination made through processes like those outlined in the AMASR Act.  The constitution sets a broad principle, while specific implementation relies on legislation.


Therefore, only none of the statements are correct.



**2. Consider the following features of the ‘Lady Justice’ statue at the Supreme Court of India, unveiled recently:**

1.  It is directly inspired by classical Greek depictions of Themis.
2.  The statue wears a saree, reflecting Indian traditions.
3.  The blindfold is retained to symbolize impartiality.
4. The scales are absent, symbolizing a shift away from impartial judgment.


Which of the above features accurately describes the new statue?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the origins of the Lady Justice motif are rooted in Greco-Roman mythology, the new Supreme Court statue is a deliberate departure from purely classical representations. Its design incorporates distinctly Indian elements, signifying a move away from colonial symbolism.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key aspect of the new statue's design is its depiction of Lady Justice in a saree, a conscious choice to align the symbol with Indian cultural identity and to decolonize the representation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. A significant change in the new statue is the removal of the blindfold.  The open eyes represent the law's active engagement with society's complexities and the need for a nuanced understanding of justice, rather than a simplistic concept of blind impartiality.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The scales are retained in the new statue.  The scales represent the essential function of courts to weigh evidence impartially and to consider both sides before a judgment.  This element is integral to the concept of justice and has not been removed.

Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a feature of the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India.



**3. Consider the following statements about the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It was primarily focused on securing equal rights for women in Travancore.
2.  K. Kelappan, also known as "Kerala Gandhi," was a key leader of the movement.
3.  The movement's success led to the immediate and complete removal of all caste-based restrictions on temple entry.
4.  Gandhi's involvement in the movement was entirely supportive of Periyar's approach.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha's central aim was to secure access for lower-caste individuals to public roads leading to the Vaikom temple. While women's rights were a broader concern of the era, they weren't the primary focus of this specific movement. The movement's success was a landmark victory in the fight against caste-based discrimination

Statement 2 is correct. K. Kelappan, known as "Kerala Gandhi," played a significant role in leading the Vaikom Satyagraha.  His participation and leadership were crucial to the movement's success and impact.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vaikom Satyagraha resulted in partial success.  While access to some roads leading to the temple was granted, complete removal of all caste-based restrictions on temple entry took more time and further struggle.  The movement was a key step, but not the final solution.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Gandhi's and Periyar's approaches to the Vaikom Satyagraha differed significantly. While Gandhi viewed it as a Hindu reformist movement, Periyar considered it a fight against caste-based oppression.  Their perspectives diverged on the nature of the struggle and its ultimate goals, leading to a rift between them.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha.



**4. Consider the following regarding the Nalanda University:**

1.  It was originally established during the Mughal era.
2.  Its curriculum primarily focused on religious studies, excluding secular subjects.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ancient Nalanda University was founded by Kumargupta I in the 5th century CE, long before the Mughal era.  The modern university is a revival of this ancient institution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Nalanda University was a significant center of Buddhist learning, its curriculum was far from limited to religious studies.  It encompassed a wide range of subjects, including medicine, astronomy, politics, and military strategy, showcasing a broad intellectual scope.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The new Nalanda University campus is located in Rajgir, Bihar, not Uttar Pradesh.  The location was chosen for its proximity to the ancient Nalanda ruins.

Statement 4 is correct. The "Dharma Gunj" or "Mountain of Truth" library of the ancient Nalanda University was legendary for its massive collection of books, holding an estimated nine million volumes across nine floors.  This highlights the university's intellectual significance.

Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**5. Consider the following initiatives of the Ministry of Textiles:**

1.  The "Kasturi Cotton Bharat" brand utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.
2.  The initiative is solely implemented by the Cotton Corporation of India.
3.  The primary aim is to reduce the cost of cotton production.
4.  The brand focuses exclusively on organic cotton production.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand uses blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability and certification of the cotton, from farm to final product. This enhances transparency and builds consumer trust.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative is a joint effort involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, various trade bodies, and the industry itself.  It's not a solely government-run program.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While enhancing global competitiveness is a goal, reducing production costs isn't the primary focus.  The initiative prioritizes improving quality, traceability, and sustainability to increase the value and appeal of Indian cotton in the global market.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While sustainability is a key element, the Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand doesn't restrict itself to organic cotton alone.  The focus is on premium quality cotton, encompassing various types that meet specific quality standards and traceability requirements.

Therefore, only one statement is correct.

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements related to the delisting of centrally protected monuments in India:**

1. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) bases its decision on a report by the Ministry of Culture.
2.  "Untraceable monuments" are explicitly defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.
3. Delisting a monument under Section 35 of the AMASR Act, 1958, removes its protection and maintenance by the ASI.
4.  Article 49 of the Indian Constitution mandates the state's responsibility to protect all ancient monuments.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text explicitly states that the decision to delist monuments is based on a report from the Ministry of Culture.  Statement 2 is incorrect: The text clarifies that the term "Missing Monuments" used by the CAG, not "Untraceable Monuments," is not found in the AMASR Act.  Statement 3 is correct:  The passage explains that delisting under Section 35 removes ASI protection and maintenance, allowing for construction and urbanization. Statement 4 is partially correct but misleading as a distractor: Article 49 directs the state to protect monuments *of national importance*.  The ASI's delisting process implies a determination that a monument is *no longer* of national importance.  Therefore, while the Constitution generally mandates protection, it doesn't mandate protection of *all* monuments regardless of their current status. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate, making (c) the correct option.


**2. Consider the following features of the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1. It was a non-violent movement protesting against the exclusion of lower-caste Hindus from accessing a temple.
2.  The movement lasted for exactly 600 days.
3.  Mahatma Gandhi actively participated in the initial stages of the movement, providing direct leadership.
4.  The movement resulted in the immediate and complete opening of all access points to the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Vaikom Satyagraha was indeed a non-violent protest against caste-based exclusion from the temple.  Statement 2 is incorrect: The Satyagraha lasted for 604 days, not 600. This slight difference is a key distractor. Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading:  Gandhi supported the movement and offered guidance, but he didn't directly lead the daily protests. The text mentions several key leaders in Kerala who were at the forefront.  Statement 4 is incorrect: The movement led to legal reforms and the eventual opening of some, but not all, access points to the temple.  The partial success and the subsequent rift between Gandhi and Periyar are important contextual points.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are partially correct, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following regarding the new Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India:**

1. The statue depicts Lady Justice wearing Western attire.
2. The scales symbolize impartial weighing of evidence.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The text specifically mentions that the new statue depicts Lady Justice in a saree, replacing Western attire as a symbol of decolonization.  Statement 2 is correct: The scales remain a symbol of impartiality in the new statue. Statement 3 is incorrect:  The text highlights that the blindfold has been removed, signifying that the law is not blind but sees everyone equally.  This is a crucial detail designed as a distractor. Statement 4 is correct: The sword has been replaced with the Indian Constitution to emphasize its supremacy in the Indian legal system.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct, making (b) the correct option.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The text mentions that while initially not conferred posthumously, this changed in 1966, making it a regular practice.  Statement 2 is incorrect: Article 18(1) of the Constitution prohibits the use of "Bharat Ratna" as a title.  Statement 3 is correct: The award's design includes "Satyameva Jayate" on the reverse. Statement 4 is incorrect: The text clarifies that the Prime Minister recommends the award to the President.  Therefore, only statements 3 is correct, making (b) the correct answer.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The Amara-Nayakas did retain a portion of the tax revenue for their personal use and maintenance.

2.  Rajendra I's conquests included the annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka.
3.  The Chola navy facilitated extensive trade with Southeast Asian nations.
4.  Nagapattinam served as a significant naval base for the Chola Empire.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate concerning the Chola Empire's naval capabilities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The Chola navy's control of the Bay of Bengal enabled a flourishing trade network with Southeast Asia, a key aspect of their "Look East Policy."  Statement 2 is also correct: Rajendra I's military campaigns resulted in the complete subjugation of Sri Lanka, making it a Chola province. Statement 4 is correct: Nagapattinam was a crucial trading and naval center during the Chola period.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect. While Rajaraja I had significant naval victories, the text specifies the destruction of the *Chera*, not the Pandya navy at Kandalursalai.  The inclusion of this incorrect statement, closely related to the actual events, creates a strong distractor, making the question more challenging.


**2. Consider the following features of the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty's rule witnessed the empire's initial establishment.
2.  Krishnadevaraya's reign marked a period of significant territorial expansion, including the conquest of Orissa.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Vijayanagara Empire. The Sangama dynasty founded the empire, and Krishnadevaraya's reign was a period of significant expansion, including the conquest of Orissa. However, statement 3 is false. The Aravidu dynasty was plagued by internal conflicts and external pressures, leading to the empire's eventual decline. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while Amara-Nayakas collected taxes, they did not retain all the revenue; a portion went to the central treasury. The inclusion of these partially true but ultimately inaccurate statements makes the question more complex.


**3. Consider the following about the UNESCO Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The MOW Programme was launched in 1992.
2.  The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works such as the Panchatantra and the Ramayana.
3.  The 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Which of the statements above correctly describe the UNESCO MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate representations of the UNESCO MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register. The program was indeed launched in 1992. The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works, including the Panchatantra. The 10th meeting of the MOWCAP did take place in Ulaanbaatar. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the MOW program maintains three registers: international, regional, and national. This incorrect statement acts as a significant distractor, demanding careful consideration of the facts.


**4. Consider the following elements related to Transhumance:**

1.  The practice is primarily associated with sedentary agricultural communities.
2.  The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage.
3.  In India, transhumance is prevalent only in the Himalayan region.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Alpine Pasture season of Switzerland has UNESCO recognition, and Gujars and Bakarwals are examples of nomadic tribes practicing transhumance in India. However, statement 1 is incorrect; transhumance is specifically associated with *nomadic* pastoral communities, not sedentary agricultural ones. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while prevalent in the Himalayas, transhumance is also practiced in other parts of India, as mentioned in the text. The inclusion of these partially correct statements increases the difficulty and requires precise knowledge of the subject.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The civilization primarily flourished in the Ganges River basin.
2.  The Harappans were the earliest known civilization to produce cotton.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The Harappans were indeed pioneers in cotton production, and the "Dancing Girl" statue showcases their advanced bronze casting techniques using the "lost wax" method. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the civilization flourished in the Indus and Saraswati river basins, not the Ganges. Statement 4 is also incorrect; their writing system remains undeciphered despite its unique boustrophedon style.  These partially true but ultimately false statements act as effective distractors.


**6. Consider the following features related to the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor project:**

1.  The project's primary aim was to improve connectivity to the Sheetla Mata Temple.
2.  The corridor project involved the restoration of smaller temples around the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on challenging factual recall and analysis, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding megalithic structures in India:**

1. Dolmenoid cists are a type of chamber tomb, typically semi-subterranean.
2.  Megalithic structures are exclusively associated with burial practices.
3.  The Ooragutta site in Telangana is known for its Iron Age megalithic remains.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Dolmenoid cists are indeed a type of chamber tomb, characterized by their semi-subterranean construction.  This is a well-established fact in Indian archaeology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While many megalithic structures served as burial chambers,  there are examples of megaliths that are not directly associated with burials. The text itself mentions "megaliths not connected with burials" as a distinct category, indicating a diversity of functions beyond funerary rites. This demonstrates a need for nuanced understanding of megalithic cultures.

Statement 3 is correct. The text specifically mentions the discovery of Ooragutta as an Iron Age megalithic site in Telangana. This highlights the ongoing archaeological discoveries enriching our understanding of India's prehistoric past.

Therefore, only two statements are correct.  The incorrect option (c) presents a common misconception, assuming all megaliths are solely burial sites. Option (a) and (d) are incorrect based on the correctness of statements 1 and 3.



**2. Consider the following features related to the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1. The empire's zenith was reached during the Tuluva Dynasty.
2.  The Raichur Doab was acquired during the reign of Krishnadevaraya.
3.  The Amara-Nayakas were primarily religious officials responsible for temple administration.
4.  The Virupaksha Temple is a significant architectural marvel of the empire.

Which of the above features are correctly associated with the Vijayanagara Empire?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tuluva Dynasty is historically recognized as the period when the Vijayanagara Empire reached its peak in terms of power, extent and cultural flourishing.

Statement 2 is correct.  The acquisition of the Raichur Doab during Krishnadevaraya's reign is a well-documented historical fact, showcasing his military prowess and expansionist policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Amara-Nayakas were primarily military commanders, given territories to govern, and responsible for collecting taxes. While they might have played a role in temple maintenance, their primary function was not religious administration. This highlights the importance of understanding the complex political structure of the empire.

Statement 4 is correct. The Virupaksha Temple at Hampi is a renowned architectural achievement of the Vijayanagara Empire, showcasing its architectural prowess and artistic capabilities.

Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe features of the Vijayanagara Empire.  Option (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 3, and the correct identification of other statements.



**3. Consider the following statements regarding Buddhist sites in India:**

1. Salihundam in Srikakulam is known for its association with the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra.
2.  The Bavikonda Monastery is associated with Mahayana Buddhism.
3.  The Phanigiri site in Telangana contains evidence of both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhist sects coexisting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly links Salihundam to the spread of Buddhism to Sumatra and other eastern countries, highlighting its historical significance as a center of Buddhist influence and transmission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bavikonda Monastery is explicitly described in the text as a Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhist complex. This shows the importance of precision in identifying Buddhist sects and their geographical distribution.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that the thoranas at Phanigiri show the coexistence of Mahayana and Hinayana sects, demonstrating religious pluralism within a single site.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the sect associated with Bavikonda and the accurate identification of the coexistence of sects at Phanigiri.



**4. Consider the following regarding the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri:**

1. The temple's architecture is exclusively of the Dravida style.
2. The Ratna Bhandar houses jewels associated with the holy trinity of Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra.
3.  The temple's architecture is a distinct substyle within the Nagara style known as Kalinga Architecture.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the temple's design is neither purely Dravida nor Nagara, indicating a unique blend of architectural styles. This demonstrates the need for a nuanced understanding of Indian temple architecture.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly mentions that the Ratna Bhandar contains jewels belonging to the holy trinity worshipped at the temple.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly identifies the temple's architectural style as Kalinga Architecture, a distinct substyle within the Nagara style.  This highlights the regional variations within broader architectural traditions.

Therefore, only two statements are correct.  Options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the temple's architectural style, and the correct identification of the Ratna Bhandar's contents and the architectural style.


**5. Consider the following features of the  Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves:**

1. They are located on the Kumari mountain range.
2. They are the earliest examples of rock-cut cave tradition in India.

4. The Hathigumpha inscription is located within the Udayagiri caves.

Which of the above features are correctly associated with the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the caves are situated on the Kumari mountain range (referred to as Kumari Parvata in the Hathigumpha inscription).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the caves are early examples of rock-cut architecture in Odisha,  the text doesn't claim they are the earliest in all of India.  There are earlier rock-cut cave traditions elsewhere in the country. This points to the need for precise geographical and chronological accuracy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The caves were built for Jain monks, not Buddhist monks, by King Kharavela of the Meghavahana dynasty. This highlights the importance of understanding the religious context of historical sites.

Statement 4 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Hathigumpha inscription, carved in Brahmi script, is located within the Udayagiri caves.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct. Options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect because of the misidentification of the religious affiliation of the caves' original inhabitants and the claim of being the earliest rock-cut caves in India.


**6. Consider the following statements about Transhumance:**

1. It is a traditional practice of seasonal livestock movement, involving the migration of human communities along with their herds.
2.  The practice is prevalent only in the Himalayan region of India.
3.  In 2023, two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity by UNESCO.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately defines transhumance as a seasonal livestock movement involving human communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While transhumance is prevalent in the Himalayas, the text also mentions its existence in the plains of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. This illustrates the wider geographical spread of this practice.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions that two transhumance traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity in 2023.

Therefore, only two statements are correct. Options (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect because of the mischaracterization of the geographical spread of transhumance and the correct identification of its definition and UNESCO recognition.


**7. Consider the following ancient universities in India:**

1. Nalanda was known for its rivaling Ratnagiri as a center for Buddhist learning, particularly in Mahayana & Tantrayana Buddhism.
2. Vikramshila was an important center of learning where Atisha Dipankara studied.
3.  Odantipuri, established in the 8th century by the Pala ruler Gopal I, attracted many Tibetan scholars.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ratnagiri is described as rivaling Nalanda, not the other way around.  This highlights the importance of paying close attention to the details of historical accounts.

Statement 2 is correct. Atisha Dipankara is explicitly mentioned as an alumnus of Vikramshila.

Statement 3 is correct. The text correctly identifies Odantipuri's founder and its attraction for Tibetan scholars.

Statement 4 is correct.  The text accurately explains the naming and association of Nagarjunakonda with Nagarjuna and his Mahayana Buddhist affiliation.

Therefore, only three statements are correct. Options (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the relationship between Nalanda and Ratnagiri and the correct identification of the other statements.

Four out of the five statements accurately reflect the International Abhidhamma Divas (IAD). The IAD commemorates Buddha's descent from the celestial realm (Tāvatimsa-devaloka) to Sankassiya, coinciding with the end of the Vassa (rainy season retreat).  The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the International Buddhist Confederation, observes this day. The Asokan Elephant Pillar at Sankassiya is indeed associated with this significant event. However, the celebration of Pali's declaration as a classical language, while possibly occurring around the same time, is not intrinsically part of the core meaning or observance of the IAD itself. Therefore, only four statements are directly related to the IAD.

(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe the Transhumance World Heritage Initiative and the practice of transhumance. The initiative is indeed led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan. Transhumance is the traditional seasonal movement of livestock and human communities. Two transhumance traditions received recognition as Intangible Cultural Heritages in 2023.  The practice is widespread in the Himalayas and several Indian plains, involving nomadic tribes such as Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas.  The information provided aligns with the facts about this initiative and the practice.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval victories included the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's conquests extended to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3. The Chola navy's dominance was primarily focused on the Indian Ocean's western region.
4.  The annexation of Sri Lanka under the Cholas involved multiple naval campaigns.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion.  Rajaraja I significantly strengthened the Chola navy, culminating in victories like the one at Kandalursalai against the Cheras. This solidified Chola dominance in the southern Indian Ocean. Rajendra I, his successor, launched ambitious expeditions that reached as far as the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, showcasing the reach and capabilities of the Chola navy.  The conquest of Sri Lanka also involved a series of naval campaigns, highlighting the importance of sea power in Chola imperial strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Chola navy operated throughout the Indian Ocean, its influence wasn't limited to the western region. Their expeditions and control encompassed a much wider area, including Southeast Asia.  The Chola navy's influence stretched across the Bay of Bengal and the eastern Indian Ocean, as evidenced by their conquests in present-day Sri Lanka, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra.


**2. Consider the following features related to the practice of transhumance:**

1.  It's primarily a practice of sedentary agricultural communities.
2.  It involves the seasonal movement of livestock and human communities.
3.  The practice is exclusively confined to the Himalayan regions of India.
4.  It's recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO.
5.  Gujars and Bakarwals are examples of communities that do not practice transhumance.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of transhumance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Transhumance is fundamentally about the seasonal movement of both livestock and the human communities that tend them. The UNESCO recognition of certain transhumance traditions further underscores its cultural significance.  Statement 2 is correct as the text explicitly mentions the migratory nature of transhumance involving both livestock and human communities. Statement 4 is correct as UNESCO has recognized certain transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages.

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are incorrect. Transhumance is not a practice of sedentary communities; it's precisely the opposite.  The practice is not limited to the Himalayas; it exists in various parts of India, including the plains.  Gujars and Bakarwals are specifically mentioned in the text as examples of communities that *do* practice transhumance in the Himalayas.


**3. Consider the following about UNESCO's Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The MoW program was launched in the year 2000.

4.  The MoW program aims to preserve and provide access to documentary heritage.
5.  The register has only one level; there are no sub-registers.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the UNESCO MoW program and its regional register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 4 and 2 are partially correct and are considered correct for this question. The MoW program's core objective is to preserve documentary heritage and make it accessible.  The register does include manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region, as explicitly stated.  However, it is important to note that the register is a *regional* register within a larger international program.  The question does not explicitly state that other regions' works are not included.

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are incorrect. The MoW program began in 1992, not 2000. The Ramcharitmanas is explicitly mentioned as being included in the register. The MoW program has multiple registers (International, Regional, and National), making statement 5 incorrect.  The fact that the Ramcharitmanas is explicitly mentioned in the text makes the statement incorrect.


**4. Consider the following mudras associated with Buddhism:**

1.  Abhaya mudra symbolizes enlightenment.
2.  Bhumisparsha mudra is associated with overcoming Mara's temptations.
3.  Dhyana mudra signifies the act of preaching.

5.  Amoghasiddhi is not associated with any mudra.

How many of the above statements correctly identify the meaning or association of a Buddhist mudra?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 1 are correct. The Bhumisparsha mudra is correctly linked to Buddha's overcoming of Mara's challenges during meditation. Abhaya mudra is correctly identified as a symbol of fearlessness.

Statements 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect. Dhyana mudra represents meditation, not preaching; Dharmachakrapravartana represents preaching, not meditation. Amoghasiddhi is explicitly linked to the Abhaya mudra in the provided text.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the India-US Cultural Property Agreement (CPA):**

1.  The CPA aims to facilitate the illegal trafficking of antiquities.
2.  The agreement restricts the import of certain Indian archaeological materials into the USA.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the India-US CPA or its context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The CPA explicitly aims to curb the illicit trafficking of Indian antiquities into the USA by restricting their importation.

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The CPA's purpose is to prevent illegal trafficking, not to facilitate it. The agreement's focus is on antiquities from India, not Europe.  The 1970 UNESCO Convention is directly relevant as it provides a global framework for combating illicit trafficking of cultural property, forming a basis for the bilateral CPA.  Statement 5 is incorrect; while both address cultural preservation, the Kashi Culture Pathway is a separate initiative.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding IYD or yoga?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are incorrect. Yoga is correctly identified as one of the six schools of Indian philosophy. IYD is celebrated on the summer solstice, not the winter solstice.

Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. The UN resolution was proposed by India, not China.  The Sanskrit root of "Yoga" means "to join," not "to separate." Statement 5 is partially correct; while the word yoga appears in the Vedas,  the text mentions systematic references are found in Patanjali's Yogasutra, not the Rigveda.  For the sake of this question, it is considered incorrect.


**7. Consider the following about the Kasturi Cotton Bharat initiative:**

1. It is solely implemented by the Cotton Corporation of India.
2.  It utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The initiative explicitly uses blockchain for traceability, enhancing transparency and accountability. It's a joint venture involving the Ministry of Textiles, the Cotton Corporation of India, trade bodies, and the industry.

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are incorrect.  The implementation involves multiple entities, not solely the Cotton Corporation of India.  The initiative aims to *increase*, not decrease, the global competitiveness of Indian cotton. The TEXPROCIL is mentioned as the implementing agency, making statement 5 incorrect.

5.  It is implemented in all major cities of India.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of Project PARI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Project PARI explicitly involves artists from across India to create public art installations.

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are incorrect. The project's execution involves both Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art.  The project aims to democratize art, not privatize it.  The project includes a range of art forms, not just traditional ones.  The initial implementation is in Delhi, not all major cities.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The "Mother Goddess" is a well-known deity represented in various terracotta figurines from the IVC.

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are incorrect. The IVC did use standardized weights and measures. Their exports included items like grain and pottery, not primarily precious metals. Their writing system remains undeciphered.  While evidence of religious practices exists, elaborate temple structures haven't been found.


**11. Consider the following about the Vijayanagara Empire:**

1.  The Sangama dynasty was the last ruling dynasty of the empire.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is partially correct. The Kalinga War is associated with Ashoka's conversion to Buddhism, not Jainism.

Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect.  The Kalinga dynasty ruled Odisha and parts of Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu. Kharavela is known for his patronage of Jainism, not Buddhism. The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves predate the Gupta period. Salihundam is a significant Buddhist site in the region's history.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the practice of transhumance?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Transhumance is defined as the seasonal movement of livestock between different pastures. This involves the migration of human communities along with their herds, making statement 1 correct.  The 2023 UNESCO recognition of transhumance traditions in Europe further validates this practice as a significant cultural heritage, supporting statement 2.  The description of transhumance in the Himalayas, involving specific nomadic tribes and their seasonal grazing patterns, accurately reflects the practice as described in statement 3 and 4. Therefore, all four statements correctly describe aspects of transhumance.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: Eri silk is indeed known as the world's only vegan silk because the moth is allowed to emerge naturally from the cocoon, unlike other silk production methods. Statement 4 is incorrect because the Philosamia ricini silkworm is multivoltine, meaning it produces multiple generations a year. Statement 1 is incorrect as Eri silkworms are reared indoors. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while India is a major producer of Eri silk, it's not the sole global producer.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding Denisovans:**

1. They are a recently discovered species of hominid closely related to chimpanzees.
2. Their geographical range was limited to Siberia during the last Ice Age.
3.  Genetic evidence suggests interbreeding with Neanderthals but not modern humans.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nagapattinam, not Mumbai, was a key Chola trading center (incorrect 1). Rajendra I's conquests included both the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (incorrect 2).  Sri Lanka did become a Chola province under Rajendra I (correct 3). The Chola "Look East Policy" focused on Southeast Asia, not West Asia (incorrect 4). Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following concerning transhumance:**

1.  Transhumance is primarily a practice limited to the European Alps.
2.  The practice involves the seasonal migration of livestock only, without human communities.
3.  In India, transhumance is confined to Himalayan regions.

How many of the above statements about transhumance are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Transhumance is a global practice, not limited to the Alps (incorrect 1).  It involves the movement of both livestock and human communities (incorrect 2).  While prevalent in the Himalayas, transhumance also exists in other parts of India (incorrect 3). UNESCO has indeed recognized some transhumance traditions as Intangible Cultural Heritages (correct 4).  Only one statement is correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the UNESCO Memory of the World (MoW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1. The MoW programme was launched in the year 2000.
2.  The register includes only manuscripts from the Asia-Pacific region.
3.  The Ramcharitmanas, Panchatantra, and Sahṛdayāloka-Locana are included in this register.
4.  The register exclusively features religious texts.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the MoW Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The MoW programme began in 1992, not 2000 (incorrect 1). The register includes works from across the region, but it's not exclusively limited to that area (incorrect 2). The three Indian literary works mentioned are indeed included (correct 3). The register encompasses a variety of genres, not just religious texts (incorrect 4). Thus, only two statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Ikshvaku period:**

1. The Ikshvaku dynasty ruled primarily in present-day Tamil Nadu.
2.  The Phanigiri site is known for its association with Jain religious structures.
3.  Archaeological findings at Phanigiri include coins from the Ikshvaku period.
4.  The Ikshvaku period is contemporary to the Gupta Empire.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Ikshvaku period?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Ikshvaku dynasty was primarily located in present-day Andhra Pradesh, not Tamil Nadu (incorrect 1). Phanigiri is a Buddhist site, not Jain (incorrect 2).  Coin hoards from the Ikshvaku period have been unearthed at Phanigiri (correct 3).  The exact chronological overlap between the Ikshvaku period and the Gupta Empire needs further clarification and is not definitively established in readily available sources (incorrect 4).  Therefore, only one statement is definitively correct.


**8. Consider the following about the Bavikonda Monastery:**

1.  It is situated near the city of Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh.
2.  The monastery dates back to the 1st century CE.
3.  It is primarily associated with Mahayana Buddhism.
4.  It is a part of the Swadesh Darshan Scheme's Buddhist Circuit.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Bavikonda Monastery?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bavikonda is near Visakhapatnam, not Amaravati (incorrect 1).  It dates back to the 3rd century BCE, not the 1st century CE (incorrect 2). It's associated with Theravada (Hinayana) Buddhism, not Mahayana (incorrect 3). It is indeed part of the Swadesh Darshan Scheme's Buddhist Circuit (correct 4).  Only one statement is correct.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Indus Valley Civilization:**

1.  The standardized weights and measures system indicates a lack of organized trade.
2.  Meluha, as mentioned in Mesopotamian records, refers to a region in present-day Egypt.

4.  The Indus script has been fully deciphered.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The standardized weights and measures system suggests organized trade (incorrect 1). Meluha refers to the Indus region, not Egypt (incorrect 2).  While they exported goods, finished metal tools aren't specifically highlighted in the available historical records (incorrect 3).  The Indus script remains undeciphered (incorrect 4).  Therefore, none of the statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding Lothal:**

1.  Lothal is located near the Gulf of Khambhat in present-day Rajasthan.
2.  The dry dock at Lothal is the earliest known man-made dry dock in the world.
3.  The National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal is being developed under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
4.  The NMHC project is solely government-funded.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Lothal and the NMHC project?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lothal is in Gujarat, not Rajasthan (incorrect 1).  While it's among the earliest, the claim of being the absolute earliest needs further verification (incorrect 2). The NMHC is under the Sagarmala Programme, not Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (incorrect 3).  The NMHC project involves a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, not solely government funding (incorrect 4).  Therefore, none of the options are fully correct, making (a) the best choice by elimination.

How many of these statements about prehistoric Indian rock paintings are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Earliest paintings are from the Upper Paleolithic period (incorrect 1).  Mesolithic paintings feature human scenes more prominently than animals (incorrect 2). Upper Paleolithic paintings depict animals more than humans (incorrect 3).  Haematite and limestone are indeed associated with Neolithic-Chalcolithic paintings (correct 4). Only one statement is correct.


**12. Consider the following about Srikakulam:**

1.  Srikakulam was never part of the Kalinga Dynasty.
2.  Salihundam and Danthapuri are significant Jain sites.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Srikakulam's history and cultural sites?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Srikakulam (Chicacole) was part of the Kalinga Dynasty (incorrect 1). Salihundam and Danthapuri are Buddhist sites (incorrect 2).  Chicacole was indeed the British name (correct 3). Nandi Hills are associated with Neolithic caves (incorrect 4). Only one statement is correct.

How many of these statements about ancient Indian universities are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vikramshila was associated with Buddhism (incorrect 1).  Nalanda was older than Odantipuri (incorrect 2). Nagarjuna was a key figure in Mahayana Buddhism (correct 3). Ratnagiri was a significant center for Buddhist learning, rivaling Nalanda (correct 4). Therefore, three statements are correct.


**14. Consider the following regarding the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri:**

1.  The temple's architecture is primarily in the Dravidian style.
2.  The Ratna Bhandar contains only the jewels of Lord Jagannath.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The temple's architecture is in the Kalinga style (incorrect 1). The Ratna Bhandar contains jewels of the holy trinity (incorrect 2).  It was built during the Ganga dynasty, not the Chola dynasty (incorrect 3). The temple's architectural style is indeed Kalinga Architecture (correct 4).  Only one statement is fully correct.


**15. Consider the following about the Kamakhya Temple:**

1.  The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly birth of Goddess Kamakhya.
2.  The temple's original structure was destroyed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.
3.  The temple's architecture incorporates elements of the Nilachal style.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ambubachi Mela commemorates the yearly menstruation, not birth (incorrect 1). The original temple was destroyed by Kala Pahar, not Aurangzeb (incorrect 2).  The temple's architecture does include Nilachal style elements (correct 3). It's located on Nilachal hills, not on the Brahmaputra River (incorrect 4).  Only two statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat brand utilizes blockchain technology for traceability.
2.  Project PARI aims to democratize art through public installations.
3.  Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi initiative focuses on responsible tourism.
4.  The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative highlights seasonal livestock movement.

How many of the above initiatives are primarily driven by the Indian government?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four initiatives – Kasturi Cotton Bharat, Project PARI, Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi, and the Indian participation in the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative (though led by ICOMOS and supported by Azerbaijan, India's involvement makes it relevant) – are directly or indirectly driven by the Indian government.  Kasturi Cotton Bharat is a joint initiative involving the Ministry of Textiles, Cotton Corporation of India, and industry bodies. Project PARI is initiated by the Ministry of Culture and executed by Lalit Kala Akademi and the National Gallery of Modern Art. Paryatan Mitra & Paryatan Didi is launched by the Ministry of Tourism.  India's active participation in preserving and promoting transhumance traditions within its borders, as highlighted by the text, demonstrates governmental support. Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect government-led or significantly supported initiatives.  There are no incorrect statements in the provided list.


**2. Consider the following statements about Chola naval expeditions:**

1.  Rajaraja I's naval conquests extended to the Maldives.
2.  Rajendra I's conquests included parts of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
3.  Nagapattinam served as a crucial naval base for the Cholas.
4.  The Chera navy was defeated at Kandalursalai during Rajaraja I's reign.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of Chola naval power?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power and expansion. Rajaraja I's naval dominance is documented through his conquests, including the Maldives and the defeat of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.  Rajendra I continued this naval prowess, extending Chola influence to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.  Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading and naval center for the Cholas is also well-established historically. Thus, each statement is historically accurate, reflecting the significant naval capabilities and territorial reach of the Chola dynasty.  There is no basis for rejecting any of the given statements.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The Ramcharitmanas manuscript is included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
2.  The Panchatantra manuscript is listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register.
3.  The Sahṛdayāloka-Locana manuscript is part of UNESCO's Memory of the World International Register.

How many of the listed Indian literary works are included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra manuscripts, along with Sahṛdayāloka-Locana, were included in the *Asia-Pacific Regional Register*.  The statement about Sahṛdayāloka-Locana being in the International Register is incorrect; the text specifically places all three within the Asia-Pacific register. Therefore, only two of the listed works (Ramcharitmanas and Panchatantra) are definitively mentioned as being in the Asia-Pacific register.  The inclusion of Sahṛdayāloka-Locana in the Asia-Pacific register makes option (c) incorrect. Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is entirely false.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum:**

1.  It commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.
2.  It is located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, which also houses Bhujio Fort.
3.  It features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.
4.  It was inaugurated in 2023.

How many of these statements are accurate descriptions of the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first three statements correctly describe the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum.  It was built to remember the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, is situated on Bhujiyo Dungar hill near Bhujio Fort, and includes a large Miyawaki forest. However, the last statement is incorrect. The text clearly states it was inaugurated in 2022, not 2023. Hence, only three out of the four statements are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either undercount or misrepresent the factual details about the museum.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1.  It is India's highest award in cinema.
2.  It is presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
3.  It was instituted in 1970.
4.  The award includes a cash prize.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Dadasaheb Phalke Award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is indeed India's highest film award, presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals, and includes a cash prize. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The award was instituted in 1969, not 1970, to mark the birth centenary of Dadasaheb Phalke.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either understate or misrepresent the facts concerning the award.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Vaikom Satyagraha:**

1.  It led to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936.
2.  It contributed to the establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission.
3.  It marked a significant divergence in the views of Gandhi and Periyar.
4.  It resulted in complete access to all temples for all castes.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the outcome or consequences of the Vaikom Satyagraha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vaikom Satyagraha did indeed lead to the Temple Entry Proclamation of 1936, influenced the establishment of the Travancore Public Service Commission, and highlighted the differing viewpoints of Gandhi and Periyar. However, the last statement is inaccurate. The Satyagraha did not achieve complete temple access for all castes immediately; it was a partial success, opening only three out of four roads leading to the temple to all castes.  Therefore, only three of the four statements correctly capture the consequences of the Vaikom Satyagraha. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the historical realities of this movement's outcome.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Kakori Train Action:**

1.  It occurred on August 9, 1925.
2.  It involved the looting of a British treasury train.
3.  It was orchestrated by the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA).
4.  The primary goal was to secure funds for educational initiatives.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Kakori Train Action?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the Kakori Train Action.  It took place on August 9, 1925, involved robbing a British treasury train, and was carried out by the Hindustan Republican Association. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The primary aim was to secure funds for revolutionary activities, not educational initiatives. Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to accurately represent the historical facts of this event.


**8. Consider the following statements about initiatives to promote sports in India:**

1.  The Khelo India program focuses on grassroots and elite athlete development.
2.  The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) provides comprehensive support to athletes.
3.  Budgetary allocation for sports has remained stagnant since 2014-15.
4.  The One School-One Sport policy is implemented across all schools in India.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the Indian government's efforts to promote sports?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect Indian government initiatives. The Khelo India program indeed targets both grassroots and elite athlete development, and TOPS provides comprehensive support including funding and coaching. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the passage states that budgetary allocation has nearly doubled since 2014-15.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the One School-One Sport policy is specifically mentioned for Sainik Schools, not all schools in India. Therefore, only two of the four statements accurately describe the government's sports promotion efforts. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the factual information provided about these initiatives.


**9. Consider the following regarding India's Gallantry Awards:**

1.  Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, and Vir Chakra are wartime gallantry awards.
2.  Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra are peacetime gallantry awards.
3.  All gallantry awards were instituted in 1950.
4.  These awards are only given to military personnel.

How many of the above statements correctly describe India's gallantry awards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly categorize the wartime and peacetime gallantry awards. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While some awards were instituted in 1950, others were instituted later (Ashoka Chakra awards in 1952, renamed in 1967). Statement 4 is also incorrect; these awards are not exclusively for military personnel; civilians can also be recipients.  Therefore, only two of the four statements accurately describe India's gallantry awards. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the facts related to the timing and scope of these awards.


**10. Consider the following regarding the National Film Awards:**

1.  They were initially called 'State Awards'.
2.  They are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
3.  Awards are given only in the Feature Films category.
4.  The 'Most Film Friendly State' award is given separately.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the National Film Awards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The National Film Awards were initially known as 'State Awards', are administered by the Directorate of Film Festivals, and the 'Most Film Friendly State' award is presented alongside the main awards. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage mentions awards given in three categories: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing in Cinema.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) inaccurately represent aspects of the National Film Awards.


**1. Consider the following statements related to the Chola Empire's naval expeditions:**

1. Rajaraja I's naval forces destroyed the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2. Rajendra I's naval conquest led to the annexation of the entire island of Sri Lanka.
3. The Sailendra Empire's Malay Peninsula and Sumatra regions were conquered by Rajendra I.
4. Nagapattinam served as a significant trading center for the Chola Empire.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the Chola Empire's naval activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of the Chola Empire's significant naval power and expansion.  Rajaraja I's naval prowess is well-documented, with the destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai being a key example of his military successes.  Rajendra I continued this tradition, significantly expanding Chola territory through naval conquests, including the complete subjugation of Sri Lanka.  His campaigns extended to Southeast Asia, resulting in the conquest of regions in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, demonstrating the reach of Chola naval power. Finally, Nagapattinam's importance as a major trading center underscores the economic benefits derived from the Chola's maritime dominance. These naval achievements showcase the Chola Empire's sophisticated maritime capabilities and strategic importance in the Indian Ocean region.  The options designed to mislead might incorrectly focus on a single ruler's achievements or misrepresent the extent of their conquests, but a thorough understanding of Chola history would reveal the accuracy of all four statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding the UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register:**

1.  The register includes manuscripts of Indian literary works like the *Ramcharitmanas*.
2.  The *Panchatantra* is a 16th-century epic poem in Awadhi.
3.  The *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* is a text on Indian poetics written by Acharya Anandvardhan.
4. The 10th MOWCAP meeting was held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the MOW Asia-Pacific Regional Register or its related aspects?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  The *Ramcharitmanas* is among the Indian works included in the register. Statement 3 is correct: The *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*, a significant text on Indian poetics by Acharya Anandvardhan, is accurately described. Statement 4 is also correct, accurately stating the location of the 10th MOWCAP meeting. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. The *Panchatantra* is not a 16th-century epic poem in Awadhi; it's an ancient collection of fables written in Sanskrit by Vishnu Sharma.  The other options incorrectly assess the number of correct statements by misrepresenting the facts about the *Panchatantra* or the location of the MOWCAP meeting.  A good understanding of Indian literature and UNESCO initiatives is necessary to correctly identify the true statements.


**3. Consider the following elements related to the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum:**

1.  It commemorates the victims of the 1991 Gujarat earthquake.
2.  It is located on Bhujiyo Dungar hill, which also houses Bhujio Fort.
3.  The museum features one of the world's largest Miyawaki forests.
4.  The 2001 Gujarat earthquake measured 7.9 on the Richter scale.

How many of the statements accurately describe the Smritivan Earthquake Memorial Museum and its features?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The museum is indeed situated on Bhujiyo Dungar hill alongside Bhujio Fort; it incorporates a large Miyawaki forest; and the 2001 Gujarat earthquake did register 7.9 on the Richter scale.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect. The museum commemorates the victims of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, not the 1991 earthquake.  The distractors in the other options play on the details of the earthquake's magnitude, the location, or the Miyawaki forest, making it crucial to have precise knowledge of the museum's details to answer correctly.  The question tests both factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related but incorrect information.


**4. Consider the following facts about the Dadasaheb Phalke Award:**

1.  It is India's highest award in the field of sports.
2.  It is presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals.
3.  It was instituted in 1969 to honor Dadasaheb Phalke.
4. The award includes a Golden Lotus medallion and a cash prize.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Dadasaheb Phalke Award?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. The award is indeed presented annually by the Directorate of Film Festivals; it was instituted in 1969 to honor Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of Indian cinema; and the award does include a Golden Lotus medallion and a cash prize.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award is the highest award in Indian cinema, not sports. The other options attempt to mislead by confusing the award's purpose, the presenting body, or the components of the award.  The question requires precise knowledge of the award's specifics to avoid selecting incorrect options.


**5. Consider the following about Transhumance and related initiatives:**

1. Transhumance is the seasonal movement of livestock only.
2. The World Heritage Transhumance Initiative is led by ICOMOS with support from Azerbaijan.
3. In 2023, Swiss Alpine pasture traditions were declared Intangible Cultural Heritage.
4. In India, transhumance is prevalent only in the Himalayan region.

How many of the statements accurately reflect aspects of transhumance and related initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. ICOMOS leads the World Heritage Transhumance Initiative with support from Azerbaijan, and Swiss Alpine pasture traditions were indeed declared Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2023.  Statement 3 is also correct as transhumance involves the seasonal movement of both livestock and human communities. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While Himalayan regions have notable transhumance practices, it's also prevalent in other parts of India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh. The incorrect options attempt to mislead by focusing on the geographical limitations of transhumance or incorrectly describing the involved organizations. A precise understanding of transhumance and its global recognition is needed to answer this question correctly.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', requiring precise factual recall and analysis to avoid plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai.
2.  The annexation of the northern part of Sri Lanka.
3.  A military expedition against the Sailendra Empire resulting in conquests in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra.
4.  The transformation of the Bay of Bengal into a "Chola Lake."
5.  The establishment of Nagapattinam as a key trading center.

How many of the above represent significant naval expeditions or achievements of the Chola Empire under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect significant aspects of the Chola Empire's naval power under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I.  The destruction of the Chera navy at Kandalursalai demonstrates Chola naval dominance in the region. The annexation of northern Sri Lanka and the conquests within the Sailendra Empire (extending to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra) showcase the empire's far-reaching naval expeditions and military prowess. The "Chola Lake" metaphor aptly describes the Chola's control over the Bay of Bengal, facilitating extensive trade. Finally, Nagapattinam's status as a key trading center underscores the economic benefits derived from the Chola navy's dominance of sea routes.  There is no element of misdirection or incorrect information in any of the statements.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Gujars
2.  Bakarwals
3.  Gaddis
4.  Changpas
5.  Rajputs

Which of the above are nomadic tribal groups known for practicing transhumance in the Himalayan region?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1, 3, and 5
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) Only 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gujars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, and Changpas are all nomadic tribal groups in the Himalayas known for their traditional practice of transhumance – the seasonal movement of livestock between high-altitude summer pastures and lower-altitude winter grazing grounds.  Rajputs, while a significant group in Indian history, are not primarily known for Himalayan transhumance.  The question uses Rajput as a distractor, leveraging the examinee's general knowledge of Indian history to create a plausible, but incorrect option.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  *Ramcharitmanas*
2.  *Panchatantra*
3.  *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana*
4.  *Mahabharata*
5.  *Arthashastra*

How many of the above Indian literary works were included in UNESCO's Memory of the World (MOW) Asia-Pacific Regional Register?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that *Ramcharitmanas*, *Panchatantra*, and *Sahṛdayāloka-Locana* were included in the register.  The *Mahabharata* and *Arthashastra*, while significant works of Indian literature, are not mentioned in the context of this specific UNESCO recognition.  The inclusion of these well-known epics serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the MOW Asia-Pacific Register's specific inclusions.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the Chola Empire:**

1.  Rajaraja I’s naval conquests led to the entire island of Sri Lanka becoming a Chola province.
2.  Nagapattinam served as a significant trading center for the Chola Empire.
3.  The Chola Empire's naval power significantly impacted trade with Southeast Asia.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate representations of the Chola Empire's naval capabilities and their impact.

This incorrect statement is included to test the examinee's understanding of the Chola's maritime activities beyond India's immediate coast.

How many of the above represent significant contributions or legacies of Swami Vivekananda?

(a) Only one

All four statements accurately reflect key aspects of Swami Vivekananda's life and work. His establishment of the Ramakrishna Mission, his influential address at the Chicago Parliament of Religions, his propagation of Vedanta philosophy, and his inspiration to Jamsetji Tata for the founding of IISc are all well-documented and significant contributions.  There are no misleading elements in this question; it tests the candidate's direct knowledge of Vivekananda's multifaceted legacy.

How many of the above accurately reflect characteristics of the Indus Valley Civilization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the Indus Valley Civilization.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Indus script remains undeciphered.  The inclusion of the partially true statement about the script serves as a difficult distractor, demanding precise knowledge from the candidate.
