(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lunar regolith is the layer of unconsolidated powdery material covering the Moon's surface.  While rock chips, mineral fragments, impact glasses, and volcanic glasses are all components found in lunar regolith,  agglutinates are unique to the Moon. Agglutinates are formed by the welding together of fine-grained soil particles by impact events.  The high-energy impacts melt the surface material, which then cools and glues the particles together. This process is unique to the Moon's environment due to the lack of atmosphere and significant bombardment by meteoroids.  Therefore, only agglutinates are a peculiar component only found on the Moon, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly suggest that multiple components are unique to the lunar surface.

(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1 did indeed detect the presence of water in vapor form and water ice in the Moon's North polar region. This was a significant finding, challenging previous assumptions about the Moon's composition.  However, Chandrayaan-2's lander unfortunately crash-landed, failing to achieve a soft landing.  Chandrayaan-3 successfully soft-landed, but this was on the Moon's South Pole, not a gravity assist flyby.  ISRO successfully returned the Chandrayaan-3 Propulsion Module from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit using a gravity assist flyby, marking a first for the organization.  The gravity assist maneuver was a significant achievement but not related to Chandrayaan-2 or Chandrayaan-3's lander. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.

4. Lunar dust obscuring camera lenses.
5.  The abundance of sunlight on the lunar surface.

How many of the above are genuine challenges in achieving a soft landing on the Moon?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Soft-landing a lunar module presents several significant challenges.  Unexpected terrain changes can indeed cause altitude sensor errors and software glitches. The separation of the lander from the propulsion module and its subsequent descent necessitates precise navigation and control over a considerable distance.  The extremely high initial velocity requires a complex system of retro-rockets and thrusters to decelerate the lander to zero velocity safely, particularly given the lack of atmospheric drag. Lunar dust is a known hazard, potentially obscuring cameras and other sensors, leading to incorrect readings.  Sunlight's abundance is not a challenge; in fact,  the lack of sunlight during the lunar night presents a more significant challenge to the mission's survival. Therefore, all four of the listed items (1-4) are valid challenges.

How many of the above are accurate descriptions of the Aditya-L1 mission's characteristics?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1 is India's first space-based observatory-class solar mission.  Its scientific objectives include studying solar upper atmospheric dynamics, which is correct.  However, Aditya-L1 is placed in a halo orbit at Lagrange Point L1, not L2.  The mission does carry seven payloads, including the Visible Emission Line Coronograph (VELC) and the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT), making statement 3 correct. The mission also achieved the first spatially resolved solar disk in the near UV band, a significant technological advancement.  Its position at L1 does indeed provide continuous observation of the sun, making 5 also true.  Therefore, three statements (1, 3, 4, and 5) accurately describe Aditya-L1.

5. Only one side of the Moon is illuminated by sunlight.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the phenomenon of tidal locking?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tidal locking is a gravitational phenomenon where one body's rotational period is equal to its orbital period around another body.  This is true for the Earth-Moon system.  As a result, only one side of the Moon always faces the Earth.  However, the statement that the Earth's gravitational force is uniform across the Moon's surface is incorrect; the force is stronger on the side facing the Earth.  While tidal locking does cause some distortion, it's not as significant as implied.  Finally, both sides of the Moon experience sunlight during different parts of its orbit. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe tidal locking, making (c) the correct answer.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.  The explanations are detailed, exceeding 100 words each, and incorporate UPSC-relevant perspectives.


**1. Consider the following components of lunar regolith:**

1. Rock chips
2. Mineral fragments
3. Impact glasses
4. Volcanic glasses
5. Agglutinates
6. Micrometeoroids

How many of the above are unique components exclusively found on the Moon's surface?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) Only one.  Agglutinates are the only components listed that are uniquely found on the Moon.  They are formed by the welding together of fine-grained lunar dust particles due to the constant bombardment of micrometeoroids and solar radiation. This process of agglutination is a direct consequence of the Moon's unique environment, devoid of a significant atmosphere and characterized by intense radiation.  While rock chips, mineral fragments, and impact/volcanic glasses are found on other celestial bodies, their specific composition and formation processes may differ.

Short-read sequencing, not long-read sequencing, is more effective for counting the abundance of specific sequences; long-read sequencing excels at resolving complex repetitive regions.


**9. Consider the following about  Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT):**

1. MDT is a procedure used in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from the mother to the offspring.
2. MDT involves using genetic material from three individuals: the parents and a mitochondrial donor.
3. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are techniques used in MDT.
4. MDT results in offspring with a complete absence of the mother's mitochondrial DNA.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. MDT is used to prevent mitochondrial diseases, involves genetic material from three individuals, and utilizes MST and PNT techniques. Statement 4 is incorrect.  While MDT aims to minimize the transmission of defective mitochondrial DNA, it doesn't completely eliminate the mother's mitochondrial DNA; a small percentage from the mother will still be present.


**10. Consider the following regarding  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):**

1. SMRs are advanced nuclear reactors with power generation capacities ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe.
2. SMRs are characterized by their small physical size and modular design, facilitating factory assembly and transportation.

The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, making the questions challenging even for well-prepared candidates.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to challenge UPSC aspirants.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the regulation of generic medicines in India:**

1. The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, mandate licensing for drug formulations with a single active ingredient listed by its proper name.
2. The Indian Medical Council's regulations encourage doctors to prescribe drugs using generic names.
3. The Drugs Technical Advisory Board of India (DTAB) permits pharmacies to sell generic medicines even if the prescription specifies branded versions.
4. The National Medical Commission Act, 2019, empowers State Medical Councils to penalize doctors for prescribing branded medicines.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulatory landscape for generic drugs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate representations of the regulatory framework governing generic medicines in India.  The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, indeed require licenses for single-ingredient formulations using the proper name, promoting generic prescriptions.  The Indian Medical Council's regulations explicitly encourage the use of generic names in prescriptions.  The DTAB's role in allowing pharmacies to dispense generic equivalents, even when branded versions are prescribed, further supports the push for generic use.  However, statement 4 is inaccurate. While the National Medical Commission Act, 2019, does establish disciplinary mechanisms, it doesn't specifically mandate penalties for prescribing branded medicines; the emphasis remains on promoting generic prescriptions. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features related to  'Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)' legislation:**

1. It establishes a legal framework for crypto-asset service providers and consumer protection.
2. It categorizes crypto assets into Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs), Asset Referenced Tokens (ARTs), and Utility Tokens (UTs).
3. It explicitly includes Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) within its regulatory scope.
4. It applies to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) issued by member states.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the key features of the MiCA legislation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly reflect aspects of the MiCA legislation.  It does create a legal framework for crypto-asset service providers and includes consumer protection measures.  The categorization of crypto assets into EMTs, ARTs, and UTs is also a core element of MiCA.  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.  MiCA specifically *excludes* NFTs and DeFi from its initial regulatory scope, focusing on other categories of crypto assets.  Similarly, CBDCs are generally considered outside the purview of MiCA, as they are typically regulated separately by central banks.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe MiCA's key features.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the National Quantum Mission (NQM):**

2. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) is the sole implementing agency for the NQM.
3. The NQM aims to develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with a range of 50-1000 physical qubits.
4. The NQM's objectives include establishing satellite-based quantum communication between ground stations within India, but excludes international links.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the National Quantum Mission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the NQM. The MCC's operational structure under the MTRC is correct, as is the DST's role as the primary implementing agency. The NQM's goal of developing intermediate-scale quantum computers within the specified qubit range is also a stated objective. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The NQM explicitly aims to develop satellite-based quantum communication not only within India but also with other countries, highlighting international collaboration as a key component of the mission.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the  'Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)'s initiatives:**

1.  FSSAI operationalized provisions of the Draft Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Amendment Regulations, 2011, setting limits on micronutrients in fortified rice kernels.
2.  The FSSAI regulates food fortification under the Food Safety Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulation, 2018, including the addition of Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12 to rice.
3.  FSSAI permits the addition of protein binders as additives in dairy products to enhance nutritional value.
4.  FSSAI has approved several artificial sweeteners, including saccharin sodium, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and neotame, for use in food products.

Which of the above statements correctly reflect FSSAI's roles and regulations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe FSSAI's actions.  The FSSAI did operationalize the 2011 amendment regulations, setting micronutrient limits in fortified rice.  The 2018 regulation on food fortification, specifically mentioning the addition of Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12 to rice, is also accurate.  The FSSAI has indeed approved various artificial sweeteners. However, statement 3 is false.  The FSSAI has explicitly *clarified* that the addition of protein binders or other additives in dairy products is generally not permitted, aiming to maintain product purity and prevent potential health concerns. Thus, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding  'Gene Editing' techniques:**

2. SDN 3 involves genes of foreign origin.
3. CRISPR technology is an application of gene editing.
4. Gene editing modifies existing genetic material, unlike Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) which introduce foreign genes.


Which of the above statements correctly describe gene editing techniques?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of gene editing. SDN 3 does indeed involve foreign genes. CRISPR is a prominent example of a gene-editing technology.  Gene editing fundamentally differs from GMO technology by modifying existing genetic material rather than introducing foreign genes.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. SDN 1 and SDN 2 do *not* involve alien genetic material; they are methods of modifying existing genes without introducing foreign DNA.  Therefore, only statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.


**6. Consider the following about  'Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)':**

1. ASTR, an AI-powered tool, uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) models to identify SIM cards issued using fraudulent documents.
2. FRT maps unique facial landmarks to create a numerical code called a "faceprint" for identification or verification.
3. FRT is solely used for security purposes and has no applications in other sectors.
4.  The Param-Sidhhi supercomputer was used for processing large datasets in the development of ASTR.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Facial Recognition Technology and its applications?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of FRT. ASTR's use of CNN models for fraud detection, the creation of "faceprints" through landmark mapping, and the utilization of the Param-Sidhhi supercomputer for data processing are all accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  FRT has a wide range of applications beyond security, including areas like healthcare, law enforcement, and even marketing and advertising.  Its use is not limited to a single sector. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. OLEDs do allow for flexible and transparent displays due to their fabrication on flexible substrates. AMOLED and Super AMOLED are indeed variations of OLED technology.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; OLEDs are *self-emissive*, meaning they don't require a backlight.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; OLEDs generally have a *shorter* lifespan than LCDs, though improvements are constantly being made.  Therefore, only two statements correctly describe OLED technology.


**8. Consider the following regarding  'Types of Tuberculosis (TB)':**

1. Pulmonary TB affects the lungs, while extrapulmonary TB affects other parts of the body.
2. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant only to isoniazid.
3. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin, any fluoroquinolone, and at least one injectable second-line drug.
4. Totally drug-resistant TB (TDR-TB) is resistant to all first- and second-line TB drugs.

How many of the above statements correctly define different types of tuberculosis?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the different types of TB. Pulmonary TB is lung-specific, while extrapulmonary TB affects other organs. XDR-TB's resistance profile is correctly stated, as is TDR-TB's complete drug resistance.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. MDR-TB is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin, not just isoniazid alone.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following about  'Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)':**

1. SCD is a genetic condition present at birth, caused by abnormal hemoglobin.
2. If both parents have the sickle cell trait, there's a 50% chance their child will have SCD.
3.  SCD is characterized by mis-shaped red blood cells that can block blood vessels.
4. The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to eliminate SCD by 2047.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect information about Sickle Cell Disease?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. SCD is a genetic disorder present at birth, resulting from abnormal hemoglobin.  The mis-shaping of red blood cells and their impact on blood flow are key characteristics. The mission's goal of elimination by 2047 is also a stated objective.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  If both parents have the sickle cell trait, there's a 25% chance their child will have SCD, a 50% chance of having the trait, and a 25% chance of being unaffected.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding  'Rare Diseases':**

1. A rare disease is defined as having a prevalence of 1 or fewer cases per 10,000 population.
2. The National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, categorizes rare diseases into three groups based on treatment cost and duration.
3. The NPRD, 2021, provides financial assistance only to patients belonging to specific socioeconomic categories.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the understanding of rare diseases and related policies in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, and 4 are accurate. The NPRD does categorize rare diseases into three groups based on treatment aspects, and the PLI scheme includes orphan drugs. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the prevalence threshold for a rare disease is generally 1 or fewer cases per 1,000, not 10,000, population.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NPRD provides financial assistance based on the disease category and need, not solely on socioeconomic factors. Therefore, only two statements are correct.

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text states that Dhanush is a 155 mm, 45-calibre towed artillery gun, making statement 1 correct. It also mentions a demonstrated range of around 38 km, not exceeding 40 km, thus making statement 2 incorrect.  The presence of an inertial navigation-based sighting system and auto-laying facility is confirmed, making statement 3 correct.  The description of Dhanush as the first indigenously built long-range artillery gun is also accurate (statement 4). Finally, the self-propulsion unit for field deployment is mentioned, confirming statement 5. Therefore, three out of the five characteristics accurately describe the Dhanush artillery gun. The slight discrepancy in the range (38km vs >40km) serves as a plausible distractor.

(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the prize was awarded for experimental methods generating attosecond light pulses to study electron dynamics. Statement 2 is correct; Anne L’Huillier was a recipient. Statement 3 is partially correct; while the research *did* utilize lasers generating light pulses,  it focused on attosecond (10⁻¹⁸ seconds), not femtosecond (10⁻¹⁵ seconds), pulses.  Statement 4 is incorrect; they produced pulses as short as 43 attoseconds, not 23. Statement 5 is correct; these pulses were indeed used to image atomic and molecular processes.  Therefore, three out of the five statements are essentially correct, with the inaccuracies in statements 3 and 4 serving as effective distractors.  The subtle difference between attoseconds and femtoseconds is a key element of difficulty.


**6. Consider the following components of Lunar Regolith:**

1.  Sharp soil grains with fresh fractured surfaces.
2.  Impact glasses formed by meteorite impacts.
3.  Volcanic glasses from past lunar volcanic activity.
4.  Agglutinates, a unique lunar component.
5.  Significant amounts of water ice.


How many of the above are components of lunar regolith?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly identify components of lunar regolith.  However, statement 5 is misleading. While water ice *exists* in permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles, its abundance is not "significant" in the context of the overall regolith composition. The regolith is primarily composed of rock fragments, dust, and glass. The presence of water ice is a localized phenomenon.  Therefore, only four of the listed items are accurate components of the lunar regolith. The inclusion of the plausible but ultimately inaccurate statement about water ice increases the question's difficulty.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Lagrangian points?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Lagrangian points are positions where the gravitational pull of two large bodies equals the necessary centripetal force, not where forces are zero.  There are five Lagrangian points in a two-body system. L4 and L5 are stable, while L1, L2, and L3 are unstable.  A spacecraft at L1 has the advantage of continuous solar observation.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.  Statements 1 and 3 include common misconceptions about Lagrangian points to increase question difficulty.

The fusion process faces a significant hurdle: the Coulomb Barrier, which is the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.  Overcoming this barrier requires supplying massive amounts of energy. Currently, the energy required to initiate and sustain controlled nuclear fusion reactions in experimental settings exceeds the energy generated by the fusion process itself.  Significant advancements are needed to achieve net energy gain, making the process commercially viable for electricity generation.


**2. Consider the following statements about Net Energy Gain (NEG) in nuclear fusion:**

1.  NEG is crucial for commercial viability.
2.  The ITER project aims to demonstrate NEG.
3.  India's ADITYA tokamak is designed to achieve NEG.
4.  NEG implies that the fusion process generates more energy than it consumes.
5.  The SST-1 tokamak is a fully indigenous project.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding NEG in nuclear fusion?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  Achieving Net Energy Gain (NEG)—where the energy produced by nuclear fusion exceeds the energy required to initiate and maintain the reaction—is essential for making fusion power a commercially viable energy source.  The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project is a global collaboration with the explicit goal of demonstrating NEG from fusion reactors.  India's indigenous tokamak, ADITYA, and its semi-indigenous tokamak, SST-1, are both experimental devices contributing to the advancement of fusion technology and aiming towards achieving NEG.  The definition of NEG itself is that the energy output surpasses the energy input.  However, statement 5 is incorrect.  While ADITYA is fully indigenous, the SST-1 is described as *semi*-indigenous, indicating a degree of foreign collaboration in its development.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly represent the CAC's functions and international standing. The CAC is indeed a joint initiative of WHO and FAO, aiming to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in international food trade.  Its "Food Code" is a compilation of various standards, guidelines, and codes of practice relevant to food safety and trade.  Importantly, the WTO's SPS agreement acknowledges Codex standards, giving them significant weight in international trade regulations. Statement 2 is incorrect; Codex standards are voluntary, not mandatory, for member countries, although they are influential in shaping national regulations.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) is implemented by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect regarding the implementing ministry.

The Free Drugs Service Initiative is a component of the National Health Mission (NHM), which falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Thus, statement 2 is correct.

The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals, while indirectly supporting the availability of affordable medicines, is primarily administered by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.  Statement 3 is therefore incorrect in terms of the implementing ministry.

Consequently, only the Free Drugs Service Initiative (NHM) is directly under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, indeed mandate licenses for drug formulations containing a single active ingredient, explicitly mentioned by its proper (generic) name.  This promotes transparency and avoids confusion stemming from multiple brand names for the same drug.

Statement 2 is partially correct but requires nuance. While the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) plays a significant role in promoting generic medicine usage, the rules themselves don't directly grant pharmacies this specific power.  The DTAB's recommendations influence the practice, but the legal framework is more complex.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While prescriptions are essential for many drugs, the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules don't entirely prohibit the sale of drugs without prescriptions in all cases.  Over-the-counter medications and certain other categories may not require prescriptions.

Statement 4 is correct. The Rules encompass a comprehensive framework for the approval and registration of new drugs, ensuring quality control and safety standards are met before they enter the market.  This involves stringent testing and documentation processes.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the core principles of the 1945 Rules regarding licensing and drug registration.  Statement 2 is partially true due to DTAB's influence, and statement 3 is entirely false.

2. Mineral fragments
3. Impact glasses
4. Volcanic glasses
5. Agglutinates
6. Micrometeoroids

How many of the above are exclusively found on the Moon?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) More than three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Agglutinates are a unique component of lunar regolith formed by the fusion of lunar dust particles due to micrometeorite impacts.  This process is specific to the Moon's environment due to the lack of atmosphere and significant meteoroid bombardment. While rock chips, mineral fragments, impact glasses, and volcanic glasses are found on other celestial bodies,  agglutinates, in their specific lunar form, are unique to the Moon.  Micrometeoroids, while contributing to the formation of agglutinates, are not exclusively lunar. Therefore, only one component (agglutinates) from the list is exclusively found on the Moon. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they overestimate the number of exclusively lunar components.

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1 successfully detected the presence of water in vapor form and also discovered water ice in the North polar region.  Chandrayaan-2's lander experienced a hard landing, not a soft landing. Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the lunar South Pole and  demonstrated, for the first time for ISRO, a gravity assist flyby around another celestial body (the Moon) to return the Propulsion Module to Earth's orbit.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Statement 2 is inaccurate.


**3. Consider the following challenges associated with a lunar soft landing:**

5.  The need to use parachutes to slow the descent.

How many of the above represent genuine challenges for a lunar soft landing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Extreme temperature variations between the lunar day and night pose a significant challenge to the survival and functionality of the lander's electronics. The Moon's lack of a substantial atmosphere eliminates atmospheric friction as a major factor during descent, making statement 2 incorrect.  Uneven lunar terrain necessitates precise altitude control to ensure a safe landing, and lunar dust can indeed obscure camera lenses and sensors.  The absence of an atmosphere necessitates the use of thrusters, not parachutes, for controlled descent, making statement 5 incorrect. Therefore, only four statements (1, 3, 4, and 5) represent genuine challenges.

How many of the above statements correctly describe tidal locking?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tidal locking is indeed a synchronization between the Moon's axial rotation and its orbital period around the Earth. This synchronization is primarily due to the Earth's gravitational pull, not the Sun's, making statement 2 incorrect.  As a result, only one side of the Moon is visible from Earth. Tidal locking does cause some distortion in the Moon's shape, but this effect is less pronounced than the other effects. The far side of the Moon is not always dark; it receives sunlight during different phases of the lunar cycle.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 3, and 4) accurately describe tidal locking.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the regulation of generic medicines in India:**

1. The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, mandate licensing for drug formulations with a single active ingredient named using its proper name.
2. The Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, advise physicians to prescribe drugs using generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters.
3. The Drugs Technical Advisory Board of India (DTAB) permits pharmacies to sell generic medicines even if prescriptions specify branded versions.
4. The National Medical Commission Act, 2019, empowers State Medical Councils to penalize doctors for prescribing branded drugs instead of generics.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulatory framework for generic drugs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate reflections of the regulatory landscape concerning generic medicines in India.  The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, indeed mandate licensing for single-ingredient formulations using the proper chemical name, promoting the use of generic names. The Indian Medical Council's regulations encourage the use of generic names in prescriptions to ensure clarity and affordability.  The DTAB's role in allowing the substitution of branded drugs with their generic equivalents when dispensing medication is also a key aspect of the system.  However, statement 4 is slightly misleading. While the National Medical Commission Act, 2019, does provide a framework for disciplinary action against doctors for unethical conduct, it doesn't specifically single out the prescription of branded drugs over generics as a direct cause for such action. The disciplinary action would be based on broader ethical considerations, including patient welfare and cost-effectiveness, which the prescription of generics aligns with. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following initiatives aimed at promoting generic medicines in India:**

3.  It utilizes a double gravity assist from Earth and the Moon for propulsion.
4.  Its payload includes instruments like GALA, MAJIS, and UVS.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the JUICE mission?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) mission is indeed a collaborative effort between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency (1). Its primary objective is to investigate Jupiter and its three icy moons with subsurface oceans: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa (2).  The mission cleverly employs a double gravity assist maneuver, leveraging the gravitational pull of Earth and the Moon to gain momentum and reach Jupiter efficiently (3).  The spacecraft carries a suite of sophisticated scientific instruments, including the GALA (GAnymede Laser Altimeter), MAJIS (Moons and Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer), and UVS (UV imaging Spectrograph) among others (4). Therefore, all four statements accurately depict aspects of the JUICE mission. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one crucial fact about the mission.

1.  It is a method of determining the age of an object based on the presence of a radioactive isotope.
2.  Carbon-14 is an example of a radioactive isotope used in this method.
3.  It can be used to determine the age of objects older than approximately 50,000 years.
4.  The method relies on the decay of carbon-14 atoms after the death of an organism.


How many of the above statements accurately describe radiometric dating?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Radiometric dating is a technique used to estimate the age of materials by analyzing the decay of radioactive isotopes within them (1, 4). Carbon-14 is a commonly used isotope for dating organic materials (2). However, the limitation of carbon-14 dating is that it is only effective for materials up to approximately 50,000 years old due to its relatively short half-life (3 is incorrect). The process involves measuring the remaining amount of carbon-14 in a sample after an organism's death, comparing it to the initial amount, to calculate the time elapsed since death (4).  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe radiometric dating.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a type of galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole.
2.  It is known for emitting highly energetic particles and radiation.
3.  It is located in the constellation Orion.

Which of the above statements describe a Blazar?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** A blazar is indeed a type of active galaxy whose energy source is a supermassive black hole at its core (1, 4).  These objects are characterized by the emission of highly energetic particles and radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum (2).  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Blazars are not located specifically in the constellation Orion; Betelgeuse is. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star, not a Blazar. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe a blazar.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a proposed ultra-high-speed ground transportation system.
2.  It involves a sealed low-pressure tube system.
3.  It utilizes magnetic propulsion for pod movement.
4.  It was primarily promoted by the European Space Agency.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Hyperloop technology?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Hyperloop is a conceptual high-speed transportation system designed to move passengers and cargo at exceptionally high speeds (1).  A key feature is the use of a sealed, near-vacuum tube to minimize air resistance (2), and magnetic levitation is employed to propel the pods within the tube (3).  However, statement 4 is incorrect;  Elon Musk and SpaceX, not the ESA, are primarily associated with the promotion and development of the Hyperloop concept. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe Hyperloop technology.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a rare, long-lived radioisotope of calcium.
2. It has a half-life of approximately 5,700 years.
3.  It is produced through cosmic ray interactions in the soil.

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Calcium-41 is indeed a rare, long-lived radioisotope of calcium (1). It is formed through cosmic ray interactions within the Earth's soil and crust (3).  It's less common than carbon-14 (4). However, statement 2 is incorrect; the half-life of Calcium-41 is significantly longer than 5,700 years, it's approximately 99,400 years.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of Calcium-41.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a method of altering the DNA of organisms.
2.  It utilizes site-directed nucleases (SDNs).
3.  It always involves the introduction of foreign genetic material.
4.  CRISPR/Cas9 is an example of a technology used in this method.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Genome Editing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Genome editing is a set of technologies that give scientists the ability to make precise changes to DNA.  It involves using tools like site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to modify DNA sequences (1, 2). CRISPR/Cas9 is a prominent example of such technology (4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect; genome editing techniques like SDN1 and SDN2 do not involve the introduction of foreign genetic material; they modify existing genetic material. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe genome editing.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  It is an independent navigation satellite system developed by ISRO.
2.  It provides coverage over the entire Indian landmass and extends up to 1,500 km beyond its boundaries.
3.  It offers only one service, the Standard Positioning Service (SPS).
4.  It uses a combination of geostationary and inclined geosynchronous orbits.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the NavIC system?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) is indeed an indigenous navigation satellite system developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) (1).  It provides positioning and timing services across India and extends its coverage up to 1,500 km beyond the country's borders (2).  It utilizes a constellation of satellites in both geostationary and inclined geosynchronous orbits to achieve this extensive coverage (4). Statement 3 is incorrect because NavIC offers two services: the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) for civilian use and a Restricted Service (RS) for authorized users.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of NavIC.



**8. Consider the following:**

1.  It is the outermost layer of the Sun.
2. Its temperature is around 6500 K.
3. It is primarily composed of plasma.
4. It is visible to the naked eye only during a total solar eclipse.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Sun's Corona?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The corona is indeed the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere (1) and is primarily composed of plasma (3). It is only visible to the naked eye during a total solar eclipse because it is usually overwhelmed by the much brighter light from the photosphere (4). However, the temperature of the corona is much higher than 6500K; it is typically in the range of 500,000 K or more. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the Sun's corona.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  It is a genetic condition present at birth.
2.  It is characterized by mis-shaped red blood cells.
3.  It is primarily caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12.
4. Stem cell or bone marrow transplant is a potential cure.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Sickle Cell Disease?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder inherited at birth (1).  A defining characteristic is the abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells (2), which impair blood flow and oxygen transport. A stem cell or bone marrow transplant can be a curative treatment (4). However, statement 3 is incorrect; Sickle cell disease is caused by a genetic mutation affecting hemoglobin, not by a vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe sickle cell disease.


**10. Consider the following:**

1. It is a collection of standards, guidelines, and codes of practice for food.
2. It is jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
3. Its standards are legally binding on all member countries.
4. It aims to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in food trade.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Codex Alimentarius Commission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of internationally recognized standards, guidelines, and codes of practice related to food (1, 4). It is indeed a joint creation of the WHO and FAO (2).  Its primary goals are to safeguard consumer health and promote fair practices in international food trade (4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Codex standards are voluntary, not legally binding, although many countries incorporate them into their national regulations.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe the Codex Alimentarius Commission.


**1. Consider the following components of lunar regolith:**

1. Rock chips
2. Mineral fragments
3. Impact glasses
4. Volcanic glasses
5. Agglutinates
6. Micrometeoroids


How many of the above are considered peculiar components found only on the Moon?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  Lunar regolith is the layer of unconsolidated powdery material covering the lunar surface. While rock chips, mineral fragments, impact glasses, and volcanic glasses are common components found on other celestial bodies, agglutinates are unique to the Moon.  Agglutinates are formed by the welding together of fine-grained dust particles by the impact of micrometeoroids. This process is heavily influenced by the Moon's lack of atmosphere and constant bombardment by micrometeoroids.  Therefore, only agglutinates are a peculiar component found exclusively on the Moon.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they overestimate the number of unique lunar components.  Micrometeoroids, while contributing to agglutinate formation, are not themselves unique to the Moon.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Chandrayaan missions:**

1. Chandrayaan-1 detected water in vapor form and water ice in the North polar region.
2. Chandrayaan-2 detected hydroxyl radicals and water molecules separately.
3. Chandrayaan-3 successfully demonstrated a soft landing near the lunar South Pole.
4. Chandrayaan-3's propulsion module performed a gravity assist flyby around the Moon.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the objectives or achievements of the respective Chandrayaan missions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Chandrayaan-1 successfully detected water in vapor form and confirmed the presence of water ice in the lunar North polar region. Chandrayaan-2, while aiming for a soft landing, unfortunately experienced a crash landing but still provided valuable data, including separate detection of hydroxyl radicals and water molecules. Chandrayaan-3 achieved a successful soft landing near the lunar South Pole, a significant milestone.  Importantly, Chandrayaan-3's propulsion module successfully returned from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit, marking the first instance of such a maneuver by ISRO and the first demonstration of a gravity assist flyby around another celestial body by India.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the achievements of the missions. Statement 4 is slightly misleading; while a gravity assist was involved in the overall mission, it wasn't explicitly a flyby *around* the Moon in the same way as other planetary flybys.


**3. Consider the following challenges associated with soft-landing a lunar module:**

1.  Difficult terrain leading to altitude sensor errors.
2.  The extreme distance of the lander from the moon after separation from the propulsion module.
3.  The need to rapidly decelerate from high speeds in the absence of an atmosphere.
4.  Obscuration of camera lenses by lunar dust.
5.  Low temperatures during the lunar night.

How many of the above are considered significant challenges in achieving a soft landing on the Moon?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Soft-landing on the Moon presents numerous technological hurdles.  Difficult terrain, with unexpected changes, can indeed lead to altitude sensor errors. The considerable distance between the lander and the Moon after separating from the propulsion module requires precise navigation and maneuvering.  The absence of an atmosphere necessitates innovative deceleration techniques, as parachutes are ineffective. Lunar dust poses a significant threat to the lander's sensors and cameras. Low temperatures during the lunar night are also a critical factor as it affects the functionality of the lander's electronics and instruments. However, low temperatures are specifically related to surviving the lunar night and less directly to the initial landing itself.  Therefore, options (a) and (b) underestimate the challenges. Option (d) is incorrect because the lunar night temperature, while a critical challenge for the mission's survival, is less directly a challenge *during* the landing process compared to the other four points.


**4. Consider the following features of Aditya-L1's scientific objectives:**

1. Studying solar upper atmospheric dynamics.
2. Observing in-situ particle and plasma environments.
3. Investigating the origin of coronal mass ejections.
4. Mapping dark matter distribution in the solar system.
5. Analyzing the composition of solar wind.


How many of the above accurately describe the scientific goals of the Aditya-L1 solar mission?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Aditya-L1's primary mission is to study the Sun from a halo orbit around the Lagrange point L1. Its scientific objectives include investigating solar upper atmospheric dynamics, including chromospheric and coronal heating.  The mission also aims to study the in-situ particle and plasma environment and understand the drivers of space weather, including the origin, composition, and dynamics of the solar wind.  Investigating coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a key component of understanding space weather.  However, mapping dark matter distribution is not a goal of this specific solar mission; dark matter mapping is typically done using different astronomical techniques. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**5. Consider the following about Lagrangian points:**

1. They are positions in space where a small object tends to stay due to a balance of gravitational forces.
2. There are five Lagrangian points in a two-body gravitational system, labeled L1 through L5.
3. All five Lagrangian points are equally stable for spacecraft placement.
4. The L1 point offers continuous observation of the Sun.
5. The James Webb Space Telescope is positioned near the L2 point.


How many of the above statements correctly describe characteristics of Lagrangian points and their significance in space exploration?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Lagrangian points are locations in a two-body system where the gravitational forces of the two large bodies and the centripetal force combine to create a stable or quasi-stable equilibrium point for a smaller object.  There are indeed five such points (L1-L5) in a two-body system. However, not all points are equally stable; L1, L2, and L3 are unstable, requiring station-keeping maneuvers, while L4 and L5 are relatively stable. The L1 point, being between the two large bodies, provides a unique vantage point for continuous observation of the Sun, as utilized by the Aditya-L1 mission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is strategically located near the L2 point to benefit from its gravitational stability and minimize interference from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. Therefore, statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. Statement 3 is incorrect, as the stability of Lagrangian points varies significantly.


**6. Consider the following features of the Sun's atmosphere:**

1. Photosphere: Deepest observable layer.
2. Chromosphere: Layer between the photosphere and corona with a temperature gradient.
3. Transition Region: Narrow layer with an abrupt temperature increase.
4. Corona: Outermost layer with extremely high temperatures.
5. Sunspots: Darker, cooler areas in the corona with strong magnetic fields.


How many of the above accurately describe layers or features of the Sun's atmosphere and their characteristics?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Sun's atmosphere comprises several distinct layers.  The photosphere is the deepest visible layer, where sunspots originate. The chromosphere lies above the photosphere, exhibiting a temperature gradient. The transition region is a thin layer between the chromosphere and corona, characterized by a sharp temperature rise. The corona is the outermost layer, extending far into space and having extremely high temperatures.  However, sunspots are not located in the corona; they occur within the photosphere, areas of intense magnetic activity that appear darker due to their lower temperature relative to the surrounding photosphere.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct, making option (b) the correct answer. Option (c) is incorrect because of the inaccurate placement of sunspots.


**7. Consider the following about Nuclear Fusion:**

1. It is a process where two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus.
2. It occurs in a state of matter called plasma.
3.  The Coulomb Barrier hinders the fusion process.
4. The process currently generates more energy than it consumes commercially.
5. The ITER project aims to demonstrate Net Energy Gain (NEG).


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of nuclear fusion and related projects?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Nuclear fusion is the process of combining two light atomic nuclei to form a heavier nucleus, releasing substantial energy.  This process occurs in plasma, a hot, ionized gas. The Coulomb barrier, the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei, is a major hurdle in achieving controlled fusion.  However, achieving commercially viable Net Energy Gain (NEG), where the energy produced exceeds the energy consumed in the process, remains a significant challenge. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project is specifically designed to demonstrate NEG from fusion reactions.  Statement 4 is incorrect; currently, fusion reactions do *not* generate more energy than they consume commercially; this is the primary goal of projects like ITER.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3, and 5) accurately reflect the facts.


**8. Consider the following about  Molybdenum-99 production:**

1. It is the parent isotope of Technetium-99m.
2. Technetium-99m is used in nuclear medicine.
3. Molybdenum-99 production involves neutron irradiation of uranium-235.
4.  Molybdenum-99 is primarily produced using high-energy particle accelerators.
5. Technetium-99m is a long-lived, gamma-emitting isotope.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the production and applications of Molybdenum-99 and Technetium-99m?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is a crucial medical isotope, serving as the parent isotope of Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), a short-lived, gamma-emitting isotope widely used in nuclear medicine procedures due to its ability to be incorporated into various compounds for diagnostic imaging. Mo-99 is primarily produced through the neutron irradiation of uranium-235 (U-235) in nuclear reactors.  High-energy particle accelerators are not the primary method. Statement 5 is incorrect; Tc-99m is a *short-lived* isotope, a critical feature for its medical applications.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding  Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs):**

1. They directly convert liquid methanol's chemical energy into electrical energy.
2. They have high energy density and efficiency.
3. They operate at high temperatures.
4. They are safer to operate than many other fuel cell types.
5.  They utilize all by-products of the reaction except carbon monoxide.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics and applications of DMFCs?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) are electrochemical devices that directly convert the chemical energy of liquid methanol into electrical energy. They are known for their high energy density and efficiency, making them attractive for portable power applications.  DMFCs operate at relatively *low* temperatures, a key advantage for safety and ease of operation.  The use of liquid fuel also enhances safety compared to some other fuel cell types that use gaseous fuels.  DMFCs generate cleaner energy and can utilize all by-products except carbon monoxide (CO). Therefore statements 1,2,4 and 5 are correct. Statement 3 is incorrect; DMFCs operate at relatively low temperatures.


**10. Consider the following about  the S-400 Air Defence System:**

1. It is a mobile, long-range surface-to-air missile system.
2. It is capable of engaging multiple aerial targets simultaneously.
3. It was developed by a US-based aerospace company.
4. It has a limited ability to intercept drones and missiles.
5. It incorporates advanced radar systems with extensive detection ranges.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the S-400 air defense system and its capabilities?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The S-400 Triumf is a mobile, long-range surface-to-air missile system developed by Russia.  It's designed to engage multiple aerial targets concurrently, offering a layered defense against various threats, including aircraft, missiles, and drones.  It features advanced radar systems with substantial detection ranges, providing comprehensive surveillance capabilities.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the S-400 was developed by a Russian, not a US-based, enterprise. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the S-400 is designed to intercept a wide range of aerial targets, including drones and missiles.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 5 accurately describe the S-400.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Lithium-ion batteries:**

1.  Lithium cobalt oxide is a material used as a cathode in Lithium-ion batteries.
2.  Lithium-ion batteries utilize ether as an electrolyte.
3.  Lead-acid batteries exhibit a significantly higher number of charge-discharge cycles compared to Lithium-ion batteries.
4.  Solid-state lithium batteries are characterized by their exceptional potential energy density.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Lithium cobalt oxide is indeed used as a cathode material in many Lithium-ion batteries. Ether serves as the electrolyte in these batteries.  Solid-state lithium batteries, due to their solid electrolyte, boast superior energy density compared to their liquid electrolyte counterparts.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Lithium-ion batteries typically have far more charge-discharge cycles (5000 or more) than lead-acid batteries (400-500).  The significantly longer lifespan of Lithium-ion batteries is a key advantage contributing to their widespread adoption in portable electronics and electric vehicles.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):**

1.  They have a physical size significantly smaller than conventional nuclear power reactors.
2.  Their systems and components are factory-assembled and transported as units for on-site installation.
3.  They utilize nuclear fusion for power generation.
4.  They require refueling every one to two years.

How many of the above features accurately describe SMRs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe SMRs.  SMRs are designed to be compact and modular, facilitating easier transportation and installation compared to large conventional reactors.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; SMRs, like conventional reactors, utilize nuclear fission, not fusion, for power generation. Statement 4 is also incorrect; a significant advantage of SMRs is their extended refueling intervals (three to seven years), unlike the more frequent refueling required for traditional plants. Thus, only two statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements about Gene-drive Technology (GDT):**

1.  GDT modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns.
2.  CRISPR technology is an application of GDT.
3.  GDT increases the likelihood of specific gene suites being passed to subsequent generations.
4.  GDT exclusively employs genes of foreign origin for modification.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of GDT?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of GDT.  GDT is indeed a genetic engineering technique that modifies genes to override normal Mendelian inheritance, and CRISPR is a key technology used in GDT applications.  Furthermore, GDT aims to enhance the probability of specific genes being inherited across generations.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while GDT can utilize foreign genes, it doesn't exclusively rely on them.  The core principle is the manipulation of existing genetic material to alter inheritance patterns, and this manipulation can involve both endogenous and exogenous genetic elements.  Therefore, the correct answer is (a).


**4. Consider the following regarding Genome Sequencing:**

1.  Short-read sequencing is more effective for applications focused on counting the abundance of specific sequences.
2.  Long-read sequencing is easier to assemble due to handling repetitive sequences.
3.  The Y chromosome was the first human chromosome to be sequenced end-to-end.
4.  The Human Genome Project sequenced 100% of the human genome.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

How many of the above statements accurately describe the ITER project?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 2 is correct. ITER aims to demonstrate net energy gain from fusion. Statement 1 is incorrect; it focuses on fusion, not fission. Statement 3 is incorrect; it's an international collaboration. Statement 4 is incorrect; India is a participant.




**1. Consider the following statements about Web 3.0:**

1. It is decentralized and relies on peer-to-peer transactions.
2. It uses blockchain technology for data security.
3.  It primarily utilizes intermediaries for transactions.
4.  It offers users more control over their data compared to Web 2.0.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the core features of Web 3.0?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Web 3.0 is characterized by its decentralized nature, moving away from the centralized models of Web 2.0 dominated by large corporations.  This decentralization is achieved through technologies like blockchain, which enhance data security and user control. Statement 1 accurately reflects this peer-to-peer transaction aspect, eliminating the need for intermediaries that are central to Web 2.0. Statement 2 correctly highlights the role of blockchain in improving data security.  Statement 4 is also true; a key tenet of Web 3.0 is empowering users with greater control over their personal data, a stark contrast to the data-collection practices prevalent in Web 2.0. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The very essence of Web 3.0 is to reduce reliance on intermediaries, making peer-to-peer interactions the norm.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of Web 3.0's core features.


**2. Consider the following features of different Web iterations:**

1.  Reliance on intermediaries for transactions.
2.  Enhanced data security through blockchain.
3.  Interactive platforms and user-generated content.
4.  Peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.
5.  Easy access to static information.

Which of the above features are primarily associated with Web 2.0?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Web 2.0 is defined by its interactive nature and user-generated content, features exemplified by social media platforms and collaborative online spaces. Statement 3 accurately captures this aspect.  Furthermore, Web 2.0 platforms heavily rely on intermediaries—companies like Facebook, Google, etc.—to facilitate transactions and manage user data, making statement 1 correct. Statement 5, while describing a foundational aspect of the early internet (Web 1.0), is not a defining characteristic of Web 2.0.  Web 2.0 is not primarily about static information; it's about dynamic interaction. Statements 2 and 4 are hallmarks of Web 3.0, not Web 2.0.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 correctly identify features predominantly associated with Web 2.0.


**3. Consider the following statements about blockchain technology:**

1. It is a centralized ledger technology.
2. It facilitates peer-to-peer transactions.
3. Each transaction is recorded as a "block" of data linked to others.
4. It is primarily used for cryptocurrency transactions.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Blockchain technology is fundamentally decentralized, meaning it's not controlled by a single entity. This decentralization is what allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions (statement 2).  The core structure of a blockchain involves linking blocks of data chronologically, creating a transparent and tamper-proof record of transactions (statement 3). While blockchain technology is famously used in cryptocurrencies, its applications extend far beyond that; it can be used for secure record-keeping in various industries.  Statement 4 is therefore too limiting. Statement 1 is incorrect; a key feature distinguishing blockchain from traditional databases is its decentralized nature. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately represent the fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology.


**4. Consider the following concerning cryptocurrency mining:**

1. It involves verifying and securing blockchains.
2. It uses only Central Processing Units (CPUs) for processing.
3. It is fundamental to proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency networks.
4. It generates new coins and processes transactions.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of cryptocurrency mining?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Cryptocurrency mining is the process of validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, thereby securing the network (statement 1).  This process also involves generating new coins as a reward for miners (statement 4).  Proof-of-work (PoW) systems, like Bitcoin, rely heavily on mining to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain (statement 3).  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While CPUs were initially used, modern cryptocurrency mining utilizes more powerful hardware like GPUs and ASICs for efficient processing.  Therefore, three of the statements (1, 3, and 4) accurately describe cryptocurrency mining.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation:**

1. It regulates all types of crypto assets, including NFTs and DeFi.
2. It establishes a legal framework for crypto-asset service providers.
3. It focuses on consumer protection within the crypto market.
4. It excludes Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) from its scope.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key provisions of the MiCA legislation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

MiCA is designed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets within the European Union. A core aspect is establishing clear rules for crypto-asset service providers, ensuring market integrity and consumer protection (statements 2 and 3).  MiCA also aims to address consumer protection concerns within the rapidly evolving crypto market (statement 3).  However, MiCA’s scope is not all-encompassing; it explicitly excludes certain assets like NFTs and DeFi (statement 1 is incorrect) and CBDCs (statement 4 is correct). Therefore, three of the statements (2, 3, and 4) accurately represent the key provisions of the MiCA legislation.


**6. Consider the following statements about 3D printing (Additive Manufacturing):**

1. It is a subtractive manufacturing process.
2. It can create complex designs with little wastage.
3. It uses materials like plastic, metal, and ceramics.
4. It primarily produces mass-produced items efficiently.

How many of the above statements accurately describe 3D printing technology?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing; it builds objects layer by layer, rather than removing material from a block. Statement 1 is therefore incorrect.  3D printing excels at creating complex geometries with minimal material waste (statement 2), using a variety of materials including plastics, metals, and ceramics (statement 3).  However, statement 4 is false. While 3D printing is increasingly used for mass customization, it is not yet as efficient as traditional manufacturing methods for mass production of identical items. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) accurately describe 3D printing technology.


**7. Consider the following regarding Wi-Fi 7 technology:**

1. It is based on the IEEE 802.11ac standard.
2. It offers backward compatibility with older Wi-Fi standards.
3. It provides significantly lower speeds than Wi-Fi 6.
4. It utilizes multi-link operation (MLO) for improved performance.


How many of the above statements correctly describe features of Wi-Fi 7?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7, based on the IEEE 802.11be standard (not 802.11ac, which is Wi-Fi 5), aims to significantly improve upon previous generations.  A key feature is its backward compatibility, allowing it to work with devices using older Wi-Fi standards (statement 2).  Wi-Fi 7 also uses multi-link operation (MLO) to improve performance and reliability (statement 4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Wi-Fi 7 is designed for significantly faster speeds than Wi-Fi 6.  Therefore, only two of the statements (2 and 4) accurately describe Wi-Fi 7's features.


**8. Consider the following statements about Artificial Intelligence (AI):**

1. Generative AI uses only simple algorithms.
2. Multimodal AI combines multiple input types for problem-solving.
3. Frontier AI surpasses the capabilities of most advanced models.
4.  AI systems cannot perform tasks requiring human intelligence.


How many of the above statements correctly characterize different aspects of AI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Generative AI leverages sophisticated deep learning models, not simple algorithms, to create content like text and images (statement 1 is incorrect).  Multimodal AI integrates various input types, such as text, images, and audio, to perform complex tasks (statement 2 is correct).  Frontier AI represents the cutting edge of AI, exceeding the capabilities of most existing models (statement 3 is correct).  Statement 4 is false; AI's goal is precisely to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Therefore, only three statements (2 and 3) accurately reflect aspects of AI.


**9. Consider the following about Deepfakes:**

1. They use shallow learning algorithms for image manipulation.
2. They can manipulate images, videos, and audio.
3. They are always easily detectable with current technology.
4. They utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).


How many of the above statements accurately describe Deepfake technology?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Deepfakes employ advanced deep learning techniques, not shallow learning, to create realistic manipulated media (statement 1 is incorrect).  They can indeed manipulate various media types, including images, videos, and audio (statement 2 is correct).  Current technology is still developing methods to reliably detect deepfakes; they are not always easily detectable (statement 3 is incorrect).  A key technology behind Deepfakes is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately describe Deepfake technology.


**10. Consider the following regarding the National Quantum Mission (NQM):**

1. Its implementing agency is the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
2. It aims to develop intermediate-scale quantum computers.
3. It focuses solely on quantum computing research.
4. It has a total budget of approximately ₹6000 crores.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the NQM's objectives and structure?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NQM's implementing agency is the Department of Science and Technology (DST), not the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (statement 1 is incorrect).  A key objective of the NQM is indeed the development of intermediate-scale quantum computers (statement 2 is correct).  The mission's scope extends beyond just quantum computing; it encompasses quantum materials, communication, and sensing (statement 3 is incorrect).  The NQM's total approved budget is approximately ₹6000 crores (statement 4 is correct). Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the NQM's objectives and structure.


**11. Consider the following regarding  Chandrayaan-3:**

1. It successfully soft-landed near the Moon's North Pole.
2.  The landing site is named Tiranga Point.
3. It is India's first lunar mission.
4. It involved a gravity assist flyby around the Moon.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the Chandrayaan-3 mission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully soft-landed near the Moon's South Pole, not the North Pole (statement 1 is incorrect). The landing site is named Shiv Shakti Point, not Tiranga Point (which is the crash site of Chandrayaan 2) (statement 2 is incorrect).  India has undertaken previous lunar missions, making Chandrayaan-3 not the first (statement 3 is incorrect). The successful return of the Propulsion Module from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit involved a gravity assist flyby (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only one statement (4) is correct regarding the Chandrayaan-3 mission.


**12. Consider the following about Aditya-L1:**

1. It is placed in a halo orbit at Lagrange Point L2.
2. It carries payloads for studying the Sun's upper atmosphere.
3. It is India's second space-based solar observatory mission.
4.  Its launch vehicle was the GSLV Mk III.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Aditya-L1 mission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1 is located at Lagrange Point L1, not L2 (statement 1 is incorrect).  The mission does indeed carry payloads to study the Sun's upper atmosphere, including the corona and chromosphere (statement 2 is correct).  Aditya-L1 is India's *first* space-based observatory-class solar mission (statement 3 is incorrect).  The launch vehicle was the PSLV C57, not the GSLV Mk III (statement 4 is incorrect). Therefore, only two statements (2) are correct regarding the Aditya-L1 mission.


**13. Consider the following statements related to tidal locking:**

1. It causes only one side of the Moon to be visible from Earth.
2. It is caused by the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon.
3. It results in a uniform temperature distribution on the Moon.
4. It significantly affects ocean tides on Earth.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of tidal locking?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tidal locking does result in only one side of the Moon being consistently visible from Earth (statement 1 is correct).  It's caused by the gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon (statement 2 is correct).  However, tidal locking leads to significant temperature variations on the Moon due to the uneven distribution of sunlight (statement 3 is incorrect).  The gravitational interactions involved in tidal locking also influence ocean tides on Earth (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, three statements (1,2, and 4) correctly describe tidal locking.


**14. Consider the following about  the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11):**

1. It is primarily used for reporting mortality data only.
2. Module 2 includes codes for traditional medicine systems.
3. It is maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
4. It facilitates international comparison of morbidity data.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the ICD-11?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ICD-11 is used for both mortality and morbidity data reporting (statement 1 is incorrect).  Module 2 does incorporate codes for traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (statement 2 is correct).  The ICD is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), not the FAO (statement 3 is incorrect).  The ICD-11 facilitates international comparisons of morbidity data (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) correctly describe the ICD-11.


**15. Consider the following regarding food fortification:**

1. It involves removing micronutrients from food.
2. It is regulated under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.
3.  It is primarily used to combat malnutrition and anemia.
4.  Fortified rice kernels always contain Vitamin A.

How many of the above statements accurately describe food fortification?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Food fortification involves *adding* micronutrients, not removing them (statement 1 is incorrect).  It is indeed regulated under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (statement 2 is correct).  A key aim of food fortification is to combat malnutrition and anemia (statement 3 is correct).  However,  the specific micronutrients in fortified rice kernels vary; Vitamin A is not always included (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) accurately describe food fortification.



**1. Consider the following components of lunar regolith:**

1. Rock chips
2. Mineral fragments
3. Impact glasses
4. Volcanic glasses
5. Agglutinates
6. Micrometeoroids

How many of the above are unique components specifically found on the Moon's surface?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Agglutinates are a unique component of lunar regolith formed by the welding together of fine-grained dust and other materials due to the impact of micrometeorites.  This process, driven by the lack of atmosphere and geological activity on the Moon, doesn't occur on Earth. Rock chips, mineral fragments, impact glasses, and volcanic glasses are also found in terrestrial geological formations.  While micrometeoroids impact both the Earth and the Moon, the specific composition and formation of lunar agglutinates makes them unique to the lunar environment. Therefore, only agglutinates are exclusively found on the Moon's surface among the listed components. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly suggest that more than one component is unique to the Moon.


**2. Consider the following about Chandrayaan missions:**

1.  Detected water in vapour form.
2.  Detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately.
3.  Confirmed Ocean Magma Hypothesis.
4.  Detected new spinel-rich rocks.
5.  Accomplishment of a soft landing near the lunar South Pole.

Which of the above are key findings or achievements specifically attributed to Chandrayaan-2?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-2, while aiming for a soft landing (which it didn't fully achieve), primarily focused on expanding the scientific objectives of Chandrayaan-1.  Its key findings included the separate detection of hydroxyl radical (OH) and the water molecule (H2O), providing more detailed information about water signatures on the Moon.  It also contributed to confirming the Ocean Magma Hypothesis and detected new spinel-rich rocks. Chandrayaan-1 primarily focused on detecting water in vapor form. The soft landing near the lunar South Pole was a goal of Chandrayaan-3. Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 4 are accurately associated with Chandrayaan-2's scientific discoveries.


**3. Consider the following challenges related to a soft landing on the Moon:**

1.  Difficult terrain with sudden changes.
2.  Extreme distance from Earth.
3.  High descent speed requiring precise deceleration.
4.  Obscuration of camera lenses by lunar dust.
5.  Presence of permanently shadowed craters.

How many of the above are significant technological hurdles specifically encountered during the Chandrayaan-3 soft landing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 faced all four challenges listed.  The uneven lunar terrain posed risks to altitude sensors and software, requiring sophisticated navigation. The distance from Earth meant limited real-time control and reliance on autonomous systems.  The high descent speed (from over 6,000 km/h to zero) necessitated precise thruster control in the absence of atmospheric braking.  Lunar dust is a known issue that can affect sensors and cameras, impacting navigation and data collection.  While permanently shadowed craters are important for scientific interest regarding water ice, they weren't a direct challenge *during* the landing itself.  Therefore, all four presented significant technological hurdles.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Moon's South Pole:**

1.  Untouched craters with potential water ice.
2.  Positional advantages for future space exploration.
3.  Abundant sunlight for solar power generation.
4.  Presence of untapped resources like mercury and silver.
5.  Relatively smoother terrain compared to the far side.

How many of the above are cited as advantages of landing on the Moon's South Pole compared to the equatorial region?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Moon's South Pole offers several advantages for future missions.  Permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold significant amounts of water ice, a crucial resource for future lunar bases. Its location provides positional advantages for missions to other celestial bodies. Untapped resources like mercury and silver are potential benefits for future mining operations. However, the South Pole has limited sunlight, making solar power generation more challenging compared to the equator. The terrain is also generally rougher, not smoother.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 represent commonly cited advantages.


**5. Consider the following about Aditya-L1's scientific objectives:**

1.  Study of solar upper atmospheric dynamics.
2.  Observation of in-situ particle and plasma environments.
3.  Study of drivers for space weather.
4.  Development of a three-dimensional atlas of the Sun.
5.  Detection of water ice in the Sun's polar regions.


How many of the above are primary scientific goals of India's Aditya-L1 solar mission?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1's main objectives focus on studying the Sun's upper atmosphere (chromosphere and corona), analyzing the in-situ particle and plasma environment around the Lagrange point L1, and investigating the drivers of space weather phenomena.  The creation of a 3D solar atlas and the detection of water ice are not primary objectives of this mission; those are related to lunar missions. Therefore, only three of the listed items are among Aditya-L1's main scientific goals.


**6. Consider the following features of Wi-Fi 7 technology:**

1.  Backward compatibility with previous Wi-Fi standards.
2.  Higher latency compared to Wi-Fi 6.
3.  Increased speed and capacity compared to Wi-Fi 6.
4.  Use of visible light for data transmission.
5.  Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for improved performance.


How many of the above accurately describe key characteristics of Wi-Fi 7?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) maintains backward compatibility with earlier standards, offering faster speeds and greater capacity than Wi-Fi 6.  It also incorporates Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for enhanced performance.  Wi-Fi 7 uses radio waves, not visible light (that's LiFi). It aims for *lower* latency, not higher. Therefore, only three of the statements correctly describe Wi-Fi 7's key features.


**7. Consider the following about the components of  a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS):**

1.  Lead-Acid (PbA) battery
2.  Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery
3.  Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery
4.  Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery
5.  Redox Flow Battery (RFB)
6.  Fuel Cell


How many of the above are types of electrochemical storage systems used in BESS?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur, and redox flow batteries are all examples of electrochemical energy storage technologies used in BESS. Fuel cells, while used for energy generation, are not a type of energy *storage* system in the same way as the others listed.  They convert chemical energy directly into electricity, rather than storing it for later use.  Therefore, five of the listed items are types of electrochemical storage systems used in BESS.


**8. Consider the following advantages of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):**

1.  Adaptability and scalability to various power demands.
2.  Shorter refueling intervals compared to conventional reactors.
3.  Compact design requiring less land space.
4.  Passive safety features for enhanced safety.
5.  Higher initial capital costs compared to conventional plants.

How many of the above are commonly cited advantages of SMR technology over traditional nuclear reactors?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

SMRs offer several advantages: adaptability to different power needs, longer refueling intervals (reducing downtime), compact designs, and passive safety features. However, while SMRs aim for improved economics over their lifespan, their initial capital costs are often higher than those of larger, conventional reactors.  Therefore, only four of the statements represent commonly cited advantages of SMR technology.


**9. Consider the following about the applications of Graphene:**

1.  Energy storage in solar cells and fuel cells.
2.  Use as a component in pencils and lubricants.
3.  Application in sensors and biosensors.
4.  Use in biomedical applications like drug delivery.
5.  Use as a primary structural component in aircraft construction.


How many of the above are established or potential applications of Graphene?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphene's unique properties make it suitable for various applications.  Its high surface area and conductivity are ideal for energy storage (solar cells, fuel cells), sensing, and biomedical uses (drug delivery). It's also used in pencils and lubricants.  However, while research is ongoing, graphene's widespread use as a primary structural material in aircraft is not yet a fully established application due to challenges in large-scale production and material processing. Therefore, four of the listed applications are established or potential uses of graphene.


**10. Consider the following regarding radiometric dating techniques:**

1.  Carbon-14 dating is suitable for dating materials older than 50,000 years.
2.  Potassium-Argon dating is commonly used for dating organic materials.
3.  Calcium-41 dating offers a potential alternative to Carbon-14 dating.
4.  Radiometric dating relies on the decay of radioactive isotopes.
5.  The half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5,700 years.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of radiometric dating methods?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Carbon-14 dating has a limited range (around 50,000 years), and Potassium-Argon dating is primarily used for dating rocks and minerals (not organic materials).  Calcium-41 dating is a relatively new technique with potential applications. Radiometric dating fundamentally relies on the decay of radioactive isotopes, and the half-life of Carbon-14 is indeed approximately 5,700 years. Therefore, four of the statements are accurate descriptions of radiometric dating.


**1. Consider the following components of lunar regolith:**

1. Rock chips
2. Mineral fragments
3. Impact glasses
4. Volcanic glasses
5. Agglutinates
6.  Lunar dust


How many of the above are unique components found exclusively on the Moon's surface?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Agglutinates are a unique component of lunar regolith formed by the welding of mineral grains, glass fragments, and impact debris by micrometeorite bombardment. This process is specific to the Moon's environment due to the lack of atmosphere and the constant bombardment by micrometeoroids.  Rock chips, mineral fragments, impact glasses, and volcanic glasses are also found in lunar regolith, but they are not exclusive to the Moon.  Lunar dust is also a significant component but not unique. Therefore, only agglutinates are exclusively found on the Moon's surface.  The other components, while prevalent in lunar regolith, are found in other celestial bodies as well, albeit perhaps in different proportions or formations.


**2. Consider the following regarding Chandrayaan missions:**

1.  Successfully returned the Chandrayaan-3's Propulsion Module from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit.
2. Detected water in vapor form in trace amounts and water ice in the North polar region of the Moon.
3. Confirmed the Ocean Magma Hypothesis.
4. Detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and the water molecule (H2O) separately.
5.  Accomplishing a soft landing on the Moon’s South Pole.


How many of the above achievements are associated with Chandrayaan-3?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 achieved a soft landing on the Moon's South Pole, a significant milestone.  The successful return of the Propulsion Module to Earth's orbit is also a first-of-its-kind achievement by ISRO. The other statements relate to findings from previous Chandrayaan missions (Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2). Chandrayaan-1 detected water in vapor form and ice, and confirmed the Ocean Magma Hypothesis.  Chandrayaan-2 detected hydroxyl and water molecules separately.  Therefore, only two achievements listed are specifically associated with Chandrayaan-3.


**3. Consider the following challenges associated with a soft landing on the Moon:**

1.  Difficult terrain
2. Distance from the propulsion module
3. Speed of descent
4. Lunar dust obscuring cameras
5.  Absence of an atmosphere

4.  The Moon's spin is accelerated by tidal torque.
5. The near side of the moon has a smoother, thinner crust with large volcanic plains.


How many of the above are consequences of the Moon's tidal locking with Earth?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tidal locking results in the synchronization of the Moon's rotation and orbital period around the Earth, meaning only one side is visible from Earth. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes tidal forces that distort both bodies’ shapes.  Tidal torque, however, slows down the rotation of the celestial body, not accelerates it. The difference in crustal features between the near and far sides is a consequence of the different histories of impact and volcanic activity on those sides, but is not a direct consequence of tidal locking itself.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe consequences of tidal locking.
