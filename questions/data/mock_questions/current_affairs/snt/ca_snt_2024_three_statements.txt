(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. At Lagrange points, the gravitational forces of two large bodies don't cancel out entirely; rather, the combined gravitational pull of the two large bodies and the centrifugal force of the orbiting object balance out. Statement 2 is correct.  In a two-body system, there are indeed five Lagrange points, labeled L1 through L5.  These points represent locations where a smaller object can maintain a stable relative position. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Only two of the five Lagrange points (L4 and L5) are considered stable; the other three (L1, L2, and L3) are unstable, requiring station-keeping maneuvers to maintain a spacecraft's position.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

2. CRISPR technology is an example of a gene editing technique that modifies existing genetic material without introducing foreign genes.
3.  Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are examples of gene editing techniques that exclusively utilize existing genetic material for modifications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SDN1 and SDN2 do *not* involve alien genetic material.  The defining characteristic of SDN1 and SDN2 is the absence of foreign DNA, making the resulting crops indistinguishable from those produced through conventional breeding methods.  SDN3, on the other hand, does involve foreign genes.

Statement 2 is correct. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool that precisely targets and modifies specific DNA sequences within an organism's existing genome. It doesn't introduce foreign genes; instead, it acts as a molecular scissor to alter existing genetic material.  This is a key difference between gene editing and genetic modification (GMOs).

Statement 3 is incorrect. While ZFNs and TALENs are gene editing tools that can modify existing genetic material, they are not *exclusively* limited to this.  Their application can potentially involve introducing foreign genetic material depending on the specific application.  The crucial distinction lies in the precision and targeted nature of the modification, not the exclusive use of endogenous genetic material.  Therefore, the statement is an oversimplification and inaccurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While Adzynma's approval is significant as a first recombinant protein product for on-demand ERT for cTTP, it's inaccurate to say it's the *first* ERT approval globally.  ERTs for various other conditions have been approved previously. The significance lies in the specific application and the nature of the drug.

Statement 2 is correct. ERT is a treatment modality used for conditions stemming from enzyme deficiencies or malfunctions. While it's often used for rare genetic disorders, its application isn't strictly limited to them.  The focus on rare disorders stems from the fact that these conditions often directly involve enzyme deficiencies that can be addressed through replacement therapy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ERT is primarily used for rare and often severe diseases, making it *not* a cost-effective solution for common ailments.  The high cost of developing, producing, and administering these specialized enzymes makes it unsuitable for widespread, routine use in treating common conditions.

Statement 1 is correct. GDT modifies genes to override normal Mendelian inheritance, biasing inheritance towards specific traits. This is achieved by using components like a gene, Cas9 enzyme, and CRISPR technology to increase the probability of a specific gene being passed to offspring.

Statement 2 is correct.  GDT shows promise in controlling disease vectors, particularly mosquitoes, by introducing genes that cause sterility. This reduces the overall population and the potential for disease transmission.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While GDT has shown potential in pest control (as seen in the mosquito example), its widespread application in crop improvement and broader pest management is still under research and development.  The technology is still relatively new and faces ethical and practical challenges limiting its wide-scale use in agriculture.  The statement presents an overestimation of current practical applications.


**5. With reference to Genome Sequencing techniques, consider the following statements:**

1. Short-read sequencing is more efficient for applications focused on quantifying specific sequences or profiling gene expression, while long-read sequencing excels in assembling complex genomes with repetitive sequences.
2. The Y chromosome was recently sequenced end-to-end (telomere-to-telomere) using only short-read sequencing technology, highlighting advancements in this technique.
3. Aerial metagenomics involves directly analyzing microbial genomes from air samples, providing insights into airborne microbial communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only

3. MDT is a widely used and established procedure with minimal ethical concerns, readily accessible globally for preventing all types of inherited genetic diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MDT aims to prevent the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases from the mother by replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor. This is done in conjunction with IVF techniques, combining the nuclear DNA from the parents with the healthy mitochondria from the donor.

Statement 2 is correct. MST and PNT are both MDT techniques that combine nuclear DNA from the biological parents with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. While they differ in their specific procedures, both aim to produce an embryo free from mitochondrial diseases.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MDT is a relatively new procedure with ongoing ethical debates surrounding its use and implications.  Its accessibility is also limited due to the specialized nature of the procedure and associated costs. Moreover, it only addresses mitochondrial diseases, not all inherited genetic diseases. The statement oversimplifies the complex ethical and practical considerations associated with the technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1994 act was amended in 2011, expanding its scope to encompass organ donation from both live and brain-stem dead donors, and addressing tissue transplantation.

Statement 2 is partially correct. NOTP does maintain a national registry.  However, while guidelines have been modified, the statement that the age limit for deceased donor organ recipients has been *removed* is an oversimplification and requires further clarification depending on specific guidelines.  The statement needs more precision.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Xenotransplantation is still largely experimental and not routinely used in clinical practice.  Significant challenges remain regarding immune rejection and the risk of transmitting zoonotic diseases.  The statement presents an overly optimistic view of the current state of xenotransplantation technology.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. With reference to Site-directed mutagenesis (SDN), consider the following statements:**

1. SDN1 and SDN2 utilize alien genetic material, resulting in crop varieties distinct from conventionally bred ones.
2. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is an example of SDN3, involving gene modification with foreign DNA sequences.
3. SDN3 techniques modify existing genetic material without introducing foreign genes, thus maintaining similarity to conventionally bred varieties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement (1) is incorrect because SDN1 and SDN2, unlike SDN3, *do not* involve alien genetic material.  The end products of SDN1 and SDN2 are indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties. Statement (2) is correct.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technology that falls under SDN3, which does involve the introduction of foreign genetic material (though it's often a temporary element used as a tool for editing). Statement (3) is incorrect. SDN3 methods *do* involve the introduction of foreign genes, albeit often temporarily, to facilitate the modification of the target organism's genome.  The key distinction between SDN and GMOs lies in the final product:  SDN aims to produce a product indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties in the case of SDN1 and SDN2, while SDN3 might leave a trace of foreign genetic material. GMOs, on the other hand, explicitly incorporate foreign genes as a permanent part of the organism's genetic makeup.


**2. With reference to Genetically Modified (GM) crops, consider the following statements:**

1. Bt cotton, containing genes from *Bacillus thuringiensis*, is the only GM crop commercially cultivated in India and remains highly effective against all bollworm pests.

3. GM mustard (DMH-11), developed by Delhi University, contains two alien genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens* and is a transgenic crop.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement (1) is incorrect on two counts. While Bt cotton is the only GM crop commercially approved in India, it has demonstrably *lost* efficacy against the Pink Bollworm (PBW) pest, necessitating the development of new varieties with Cry2Ai genes. Statement (2) is incorrect. Bt brinjal faced significant opposition and was never commercially introduced in India due to concerns regarding its potential negative impacts on health and the environment. Statement (3) is correct.  DMH-11 is indeed a transgenic crop containing two alien genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*, a fact confirmed by its development at Delhi University and the nature of its genetic modification.

3. Recombinant DNA technology plays a crucial role in the production of replacement enzymes used in ERT.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement (1) is incorrect because Adzynma treats congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP), a rare blood clotting disorder, not cystic fibrosis.  Cystic fibrosis is a different genetic condition affecting the lungs and other organs. Statement (2) is correct. ERT's core principle is providing patients with the enzymes their bodies lack due to genetic or other deficiencies, thereby addressing the underlying metabolic issues. Statement (3) is correct. Recombinant DNA technology is instrumental in producing the replacement enzymes used in ERT. This technology allows for the mass production of specific enzymes by inserting the relevant genes into other organisms (like bacteria or yeast), which then produce the desired enzyme in large quantities.

1. GDT modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns by reducing the likelihood of specific genes being passed to offspring.
2. The three key components of GDT are a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (a molecular scissor), and CRISPR (repetitive DNA sequences).
3. GDT applications have shown promising results in reducing mosquito populations by making them produce only female offspring.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement (1) is incorrect. GDT aims to *increase*, not reduce, the likelihood of specific genes being inherited. This is its primary mechanism for spreading desired genetic traits through a population.  Statement (2) is correct. These three components are fundamental to the functioning of many GDT systems: a gene to be spread, the Cas9 enzyme to cut DNA at the target site, and CRISPR to guide the Cas9 enzyme to the correct location. Statement (3) is incorrect. GDT applications aim to reduce mosquito populations by making them produce *sterile* offspring, not exclusively female offspring. Sterility prevents reproduction and therefore population growth.


**5. With reference to Genome Sequencing, consider the following statements:**

2.  Short-read sequencing is more efficient for applications involving counting the abundance of specific sequences or profiling gene expression.
3. The Genome India Project aims to collect 10,000 genetic samples from citizens across India, to build a reference genome and completed sequencing of 10,000 Human Genome.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement (1) is incorrect. The Human Genome Project sequenced approximately 92% of the human genome. The complete sequencing (100%), including the challenging Y chromosome, was achieved later by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium. Statement (2) is correct. Short-read sequencing excels in applications needing precise quantification of specific DNA sequences or measuring gene expression levels.  Statement (3) is correct. The Genome India Project's goal is to collect a large number of genetic samples to create a comprehensive reference genome for Indian populations, and it did complete the sequencing of 10,000 human genomes.


**6. With reference to "Three-parent babies" and Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), consider the following statements:**

1. MDT involves IVF using the parents' genetic material and mitochondrial material from a male donor to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases.
2. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) techniques both involve creating embryos using nuclear genetic material from the parents and healthy donated mitochondria.
3. MDT is also known as Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) and aims to replace diseased mitochondria with healthy ones to avoid the transfer of mitochondrial diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement (1) is incorrect.  Mitochondrial material comes from a *female* donor, not a male donor, in MDT. The donor provides healthy mitochondria to replace the mother's faulty ones. Statement (2) is correct. Both MST and PNT are MDT techniques that combine nuclear DNA from the parents with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg to create an embryo free of mitochondrial diseases. Statement (3) is correct. MDT and MRT are indeed used interchangeably, and the core aim is the replacement of diseased mitochondria with healthy ones, preventing the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from the mother to the child.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement (1) is incorrect.  While the synthetic embryos do resemble early stages of development, they *do not* yet have a beating heart or a developing brain.  They contain cells that would eventually give rise to these structures, but they are not yet formed. Statement (2) is correct.  These synthetic structures closely mirror the earliest phases of human embryonic development, offering researchers a valuable tool to study the effects of genetic disorders and the biological underpinnings of recurrent miscarriages. Statement (3) is incorrect. The creation of synthetic embryos, while offering certain advantages, does not entirely eliminate ethical concerns.  Debates continue regarding the moral status of these structures and the potential implications of their creation and use.

Statement 2 accurately describes SDN1 and SDN2 techniques.  These methods modify existing genes within an organism's genome without introducing external genetic material.  The resulting organism is genetically similar to those produced through traditional breeding methods, a key distinction from GMOs.

Statement 1 is incorrect because while CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene-editing technology, it can be used to introduce foreign genes (as in SDN3).  The statement implies that CRISPR-based genome editing *never* involves foreign genes, which is false.  The development of low-pungent mustard involved modifying existing genes, but the technology itself isn't limited to that.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that the first low-pungent mustard variety was produced using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, not TALENs.  TALENs is another gene editing technology, but it was not used in this specific case. The statement incorrectly substitutes one gene editing technology for another.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Nuclear fusion involves the *combining* of light atomic nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen) to form a heavier nucleus (like helium), releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the process.  Nuclear fission, on the other hand, involves the splitting of a heavy nucleus.

Statement 2 is correct. Nuclear fusion reactions occur in a plasma state.  Plasma is a superheated state of matter where atoms are stripped of their electrons, creating a mixture of positive ions and free electrons.  This state is necessary for overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei and enabling them to fuse.

Statement 3 is correct.  Achieving net energy gain, often referred to as scientific breakeven, is a crucial milestone in nuclear fusion research.  It signifies that the energy produced by the fusion reaction exceeds the energy invested in initiating and sustaining the reaction.  This is a prerequisite for the practical application of fusion energy for power generation.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The H9N2 virus is a subtype of influenza *A*, not influenza B virus.  Influenza A viruses are known for their ability to infect both humans and animals (birds, pigs, etc.), while influenza B viruses primarily infect humans. Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research – National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD) has indeed developed an inactivated vaccine against the low pathogenic avian influenza H9N2 strain, specifically for use in chickens. This highlights India's efforts in developing veterinary vaccines to protect poultry populations. Statement 3 is incorrect. While direct contact with infected birds is a major route of H9N2 transmission, the virus can also spread through contact with contaminated environments (e.g., feces, respiratory droplets).  This highlights the importance of comprehensive biosecurity measures in preventing the spread of avian influenza.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Notifiable Diseases:**

1. The WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) of 1969 mandate the reporting of specified diseases to national governments only.
2.  In India, the responsibility for notifying notifiable diseases and implementing related measures lies primarily with state governments.
3. Cholera, leprosy, meningitis, and tuberculosis are examples of diseases currently not classified as notifiable in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WHO's IHR (1969) require the reporting of certain diseases not just to national governments but also to the WHO itself, facilitating global surveillance and coordinated responses to outbreaks.  This international cooperation is essential for managing the spread of diseases across borders. Statement 2 is correct.  In India's federal structure, state governments play a crucial role in the notification and management of notifiable diseases within their respective jurisdictions. This decentralized approach reflects the need for localized responses tailored to specific contexts and epidemiological situations. Statement 3 is incorrect. Cholera, leprosy, meningitis, and tuberculosis are indeed considered notifiable diseases in India.  Their inclusion in the list underscores their public health significance and the need for timely reporting and intervention to prevent outbreaks and contain their spread.


**5. With reference to Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched a Mass Drug Administration (MDA) initiative to eliminate LF by 2027.
2. LF, also known as elephantiasis, is caused by parasitic protozoa of the *Filariodidea* family.
3. LF primarily affects the circulatory system, leading to conditions like lymphedema.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Indian government's commitment to eliminating lymphatic filariasis is demonstrated by the ongoing MDA initiative aiming for elimination by 2027.  This reflects a significant public health effort to control a neglected tropical disease. Statement 2 is incorrect. LF is caused by parasitic *nematodes* (roundworms), not protozoa.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the disease's etiology and developing appropriate control strategies targeting the specific parasite. Statement 3 is partially correct but misleading. While LF does lead to lymphedema (swelling of the limbs), it primarily impacts the *lymphatic* system, not the circulatory system.  The lymphatic system plays a vital role in fluid balance and immune function, and its disruption by LF parasites has serious consequences.


**6. With reference to Phage Therapy, consider the following statements:**

1. Phage therapy involves the use of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect and replicate within human cells.
2. Studies suggest that public acceptance of phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics is increasing.
3.  Phage therapy is inherently toxic to human cells due to the similarity between bacterial and human cells.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and replicate *only* within *bacterial* cells, not human cells. This specificity is a key advantage of phage therapy, as it minimizes the risk of harming human cells. Statement 2 is correct. Growing concerns about antibiotic resistance have spurred interest in alternative therapies, and phage therapy is gaining increasing public acceptance as a potential solution.  This reflects a shift towards exploring novel approaches to combat bacterial infections. Statement 3 is incorrect. A significant advantage of phage therapy is its inherent *non-toxicity* to human cells.  The fundamental biological differences between bacterial and human cells are exploited to target bacterial infections without harming the host.


**7. With reference to Macrophages, consider the following statements:**

1. Macrophages are a type of red blood cell that acts as a part of the body's immune system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Macrophages are a type of *white blood cell*, not red blood cells.  They are a crucial component of the innate immune system, playing a vital role in defending against pathogens and other foreign substances.  Red blood cells, on the other hand, are responsible for oxygen transport. Statement 2 is correct. Research suggests that senescent (aged) macrophages can contribute to tumor progression by creating a microenvironment that supports cancer cell growth and survival.  This highlights the complex interplay between aging, inflammation, and cancer development. Statement 3 is correct. Macrophages utilize phagocytosis—the process of engulfing and destroying target cells—as their primary mechanism of action.  This ability to eliminate pathogens and cellular debris is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and immune defense.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Inverse vaccines are designed to *suppress* or *redirect* the immune system's response in autoimmune diseases, preventing it from attacking healthy tissues.  Autoimmune diseases arise from the immune system mistakenly attacking the body's own cells. Statement 2 is correct.  IVs utilize the liver's natural ability to identify and mark certain molecules as "self" (non-threatening) to retrain the immune system and prevent it from attacking specific antigens involved in autoimmune reactions.  This mechanism is a novel approach to treating these diseases. Statement 3 is correct. Traditional vaccines operate by introducing a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen to stimulate an immune response.  This "priming" of the immune system enables it to recognize and effectively fight off the actual pathogen upon future exposure.


**12.  With reference to Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs), consider the following statements:**

1.  mAbs are naturally occurring antibodies that mimic the activity of the immune system.
2.  Hybridoma technology is a common method used to produce mAbs.
3. mAbs are used exclusively in the treatment of cancers and have not shown effectiveness in other diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are *artificial*, not naturally occurring, antibodies produced in a laboratory setting. They are designed to target specific antigens with high precision. Statement 2 is correct. Hybridoma technology, a technique that involves fusing a specific antibody-producing B cell with a myeloma (cancer) cell, is a widely used method for generating large quantities of identical mAbs.  This allows for consistent production and standardization of mAbs for therapeutic use. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While mAbs are extensively used in cancer treatment, their applications extend to various other diseases.  They are used in treating infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola, some HIV infections), autoimmune disorders, and other conditions where targeted immune modulation is needed.

**1. With reference to viral diseases affecting cattle, consider the following statements:**

1. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), originally from Africa, is transmitted primarily through contact with infected animals.
2.  LSD causes fever, skin nodules, and reduced milk yield in affected cattle, but mortality is extremely rare.
3. Attenuated virus vaccines are currently unavailable for effective control of LSD's spread.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While LSD can spread through various vectors like blood-feeding insects, direct contact with infected animals is a significant transmission route.  Statement 2 is incorrect because LSD can indeed cause significant mortality in affected cattle, although the severity varies.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  The passage clearly states that the spread of LSD *can* be controlled through attenuated virus vaccines, implying their availability and efficacy.  Therefore, only statement 1 aligns accurately with the provided information.  The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding mortality rates and vaccine availability.


**2. With reference to Hepatitis C, consider the following statements:**

1. Egypt achieved "gold tier" status in the WHO's global Hepatitis C elimination program due to its effective vaccination campaign.
2. Hepatitis C, a viral liver infection, is primarily transmitted through blood transfusions and contaminated needles.
3.  While Hepatitis B and C infections globally outnumber HIV infections, effective vaccines are available for all three.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Egypt's success in combating Hepatitis C is attributed to treatment, not vaccination, as there is currently no vaccine for Hepatitis C. Statement 2 is correct.  Hepatitis C transmission primarily occurs through contact with infected blood, often via contaminated needles or blood transfusions. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage states that Hepatitis B and C infections are more prevalent than HIV, but it also explicitly mentions that there is *no* vaccine for Hepatitis C, while vaccines exist for Hepatitis A and B. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided.


**3. With reference to Nipah Virus (NIV), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nipah virus, a zoonotic virus, is primarily transmitted from humans to animals through direct contact and contaminated food.
2. Pteropus bats (fruit bats) are the natural reservoir for the Nipah virus, and their population control is key to disease eradication.
3.  Nipah virus outbreaks, like the one in Kerala, often result in significant mortality rates, and there is currently no approved treatment or vaccine.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the primary transmission is from animals (specifically fruit bats) to humans. While human-to-human transmission can occur, it is not the primary mode. Statement 2 is largely correct. Fruit bats of the *Pteropus* genus are the natural hosts, but the statement about their population control being key to eradication is a simplification.  While reducing contact with these bats is crucial, eradication is a complex issue. Statement 3 is largely correct.  Nipah virus outbreaks can have high mortality rates, and there is currently no specific treatment or widely available vaccine. Thus, statements 2 and 3 are the most accurate, although statement 2 requires nuance.


**4.  With reference to Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus, consider the following statements:**

3. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are examples of genome editing techniques that modify existing genetic material.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SDN 1 and SDN 2, unlike SDN 3, *do not* involve alien genetic material.  The key difference lies in the use of foreign genes. SDN 3 utilizes foreign genes, while SDN 1 and SDN 2 manipulate the plant's existing genetic material without introducing external genes.  The resulting crops are indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties in both SDN 1 and SDN 2 because no foreign genetic material is introduced.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CRISPR is a *genome editing* tool, not exclusively an SDN3 technique. While it *can* be used in SDN3 applications (introducing foreign genes), it's also used in SDN 1 and SDN 2 to precisely edit existing genes without introducing foreign DNA. The classification depends on the *application* of CRISPR, not the technology itself.

Statement 3 is correct. ZFNs and TALENs are indeed other established genome editing techniques.  These technologies, like CRISPR, allow for precise modifications to an organism's existing genome.  They do not necessarily involve the introduction of foreign genetic material, though they could be used in conjunction with such methods.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  GDT aims to *increase*, not reduce, the likelihood of a specific gene being passed on to the next generation. This is the fundamental principle behind its application in controlling invasive species or disease vectors. The technology biases inheritance to favor the modified gene.

Statement 2 is correct. GDT applications, particularly using CRISPR-Cas9, have demonstrated success in reducing mosquito populations by introducing genes that cause sterility in offspring.  The Cas9 enzyme acts as a molecular scissor to precisely cut DNA, enabling the insertion of the desired genetic modification.

Statement 3 is correct.  The description accurately reflects the core components of GDT: a gene to be driven, the Cas9 enzyme for gene editing, and CRISPR for targeting the specific location within the genome.  This genetic material is inserted into the animal's DNA, replacing the original gene.


**4. With reference to Genome Sequencing techniques, consider the following statements:**

1. Short-read sequencing is more effective for applications involving counting specific sequences, while long-read sequencing handles complex repetitions and loops in genomes like the Y chromosome more efficiently.
2. Long-read sequencing involves breaking the genome into small fragments (usually 50 to 300 bases) before sequencing, whereas short-read sequencing involves tagging DNA fragments for sequencing and local assembly.
3. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, successfully sequenced 100% of the total human genome sequence, including the Y chromosome end-to-end.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Short-read sequencing excels in applications requiring the quantification of specific sequences or the profiling of gene expression.  Long-read sequencing, with its ability to sequence longer stretches of DNA, is better suited for resolving complex genomic regions with repetitive sequences, like the Y chromosome.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The descriptions of short-read and long-read sequencing are reversed. Short-read involves fragmentation into smaller pieces, while long-read aims to sequence longer fragments to facilitate easier assembly and resolve complex regions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, only sequenced approximately 92% of the human genome. The complete end-to-end sequencing of the Y chromosome was achieved much later by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium.


**5. With reference to Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), consider the following statements:**

1. The USFDA recently approved Adzynma, a recombinant protein product indicated for on-demand ERT to treat congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP), a common blood clotting disorder.
2. ERT involves administering replacement enzymes to patients with conditions stemming from enzyme deficiencies or malfunctions, thus addressing the root cause of the disease.
3. Recombinant DNA technology is utilized in the production of replacement enzymes used in ERT, enabling the transfer of genes across different species to produce the required enzyme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the USFDA did approve Adzynma for on-demand ERT of cTTP, the statement wrongly characterizes cTTP as a *common* disorder.  cTTP is a rare and life-threatening blood disorder.

Statement 2 is correct. ERT's core principle is to provide patients with the missing or malfunctioning enzymes, directly addressing the underlying cause of the disease.  This contrasts with treatments that simply manage symptoms.

Statement 3 is correct. Recombinant DNA technology is crucial for producing the replacement enzymes used in ERT. This technology enables the production of human enzymes in other organisms (like bacteria or yeast), which are then purified and administered to patients.  The transfer of genes across species is a hallmark of this process.


**6. With reference to the  Chandrayaan missions, consider the following statements:**

1. Chandrayaan-1 primarily aimed for a soft landing on the Moon's South Pole, while Chandrayaan-2 widened the scientific objectives by preparing a three-dimensional atlas of both near and far sides of the moon.
2. Chandrayaan-1 detected water in vapour form and water ice in the North polar region, while Chandrayaan-2 detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately at all latitudes.
3.  Chandrayaan-3's successful return of the Propulsion Module from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit marked ISRO's first demonstration of a gravity assist flyby around another celestial body.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Chandrayaan-1's primary objective was to prepare a three-dimensional atlas of the Moon, not a soft landing. Chandrayaan-2, on the other hand, aimed for a soft landing, which unfortunately was not fully successful. The statement misrepresents the primary goals of each mission.

Statement 2 is correct. Chandrayaan-1’s findings included the detection of water in vapor form and ice in the north polar region. Chandrayaan-2 expanded on this by detecting both hydroxyl and water molecules separately across various latitudes on the Moon's surface.

Statement 3 is correct. The successful maneuver of Chandrayaan-3's Propulsion Module represents a significant achievement for ISRO, marking the first time they have demonstrated a gravity assist flyby around another celestial body.  This technique is crucial for future space missions.

1. Tidal locking is a synchronization between the Moon's rotation around its axis (with respect to the Sun) and its orbit around the Earth, caused by the gravitational force exerted by the Sun.
2.  Due to tidal locking, only one side of the Moon is visible from Earth, resulting in a near side (smoother, thinner crust) and a far side (dominated by craters).
3. The high diurnal temperature range on the Moon is primarily caused by the absence of an atmosphere and the Moon's slow rotation due to tidal locking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly attributes tidal locking to the Sun's gravitational force.  Tidal locking is a result of the *mutual* gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. The Sun's gravity does influence the Moon's orbit, but it's not the primary cause of tidal locking.

Statement 2 is correct. Tidal locking between the Earth and Moon results in the same side of the Moon always facing the Earth.  This leads to the distinction between the near side (generally smoother) and the far side (more heavily cratered).

Statement 3 is correct. The extreme temperature variations on the Moon are primarily due to the lack of an atmosphere to distribute heat and the slow rotational speed resulting from tidal locking, which leads to prolonged periods of sunlight and darkness.

2.  A recent study suggests that Calcium-41, a rare long-lived radioisotope with a half-life of 99,400 years, can be used in radiometric dating, offering an alternative to Carbon-14 for older objects.
3.  Radiometric dating methods, such as carbon-14 and potassium-argon dating, rely on the principle of radioactive decay, using the ratio of parent isotopes to daughter isotopes to estimate the age of a sample.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Carbon-14 dating is *limited* to organic materials younger than approximately 50,000 years because the half-life of carbon-14 is relatively short.  Beyond that timeframe, the remaining carbon-14 is too low for accurate dating. The statement incorrectly states it can date much older materials.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately reflects a recent development in radiometric dating research:  the use of Calcium-41, with its much longer half-life than Carbon-14, offers potential for dating much older samples.

Statement 3 is correct.  Radiometric dating methods are fundamentally based on the principle of radioactive decay, comparing the abundance of parent and daughter isotopes to determine the age of materials.  This principle applies to various dating techniques, not just carbon-14.

3. Quasi-moons have a significantly longer orbital period around the Sun compared to Earth's orbital period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A quasi-moon is not directly gravitationally bound to Earth in the same way a regular moon is.  Instead, it maintains a temporary, loosely coupled orbital resonance with Earth around the Sun.  The gravitational influence of Earth is relatively weak compared to the Sun's pull.

Statement 2 is correct.  The asteroid 2023 FW13 is a confirmed example of a quasi-moon, showcasing the characteristics of this type of celestial object – sharing a similar orbital period with Earth but with a less stable and temporary relationship.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Quasi-moons, by definition, have orbital periods around the Sun that are similar to or nearly synchronized with Earth's orbital period.  A significant difference in periods would not fulfill the criteria for classification as a quasi-moon.


**4. With reference to Zero Shadow Day, consider the following statements:**

1. Zero Shadow Day occurs when the Sun is directly overhead at a specific location, causing vertical objects to cast no shadow.
2. This phenomenon is observed only at the Earth’s equator due to the Sun's position relative to the Earth.
3. Zero Shadow Day is a result of the Earth's axial tilt and its annual revolution around the Sun.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Zero Shadow Day is precisely defined by the Sun's position directly overhead (at the zenith), resulting in the absence of shadows cast by objects positioned vertically.  This occurs because the sun's rays strike the surface at a 90-degree angle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the phenomenon is more frequent near the equator, Zero Shadow Day can occur at any location between the tropics (regions between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn). The precise location and date depend on the time of year and the latitude.

Statement 3 is correct. The Earth's axial tilt (23.5 degrees) is the primary reason why the Sun's position relative to a particular location changes throughout the year.  This, coupled with the Earth's revolution around the Sun, determines the specific days when the Sun reaches the zenith at different latitudes, causing Zero Shadow Day.


**5. With reference to Blazars, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. EMIC waves are indeed discrete electromagnetic emissions, a type of transverse plasma wave, found within Earth's inner magnetosphere.  Their generation is associated with equatorial regions, and they propagate along magnetic field lines toward higher latitudes.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The provided text explicitly mentions the recent detection of EMIC waves by Indian scientists at the Maitri station, located in Antarctica, highlighting a significant contribution to space weather research.

Statement 3 is incorrect. EMIC waves are associated with the precipitation of energetic electrons, often termed "killer electrons," which pose a threat to space-borne technology and instruments.  These electrons are harmful, not beneficial, to satellites and other space assets.


**7. With reference to Satellite Communication, consider the following statements:**

1. Satellite communication systems involve artificial satellites in their propagation path, encompassing ground and space segments.
2.  Satellite operators require frequency and orbital resource allocation from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
3.  In India, the Department of Telecommunications is the licensing authority for both telecommunication and broadcasting services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Satellite communication systems fundamentally rely on artificial satellites positioned in orbit to relay signals between ground stations.  This involves both the ground segment (transmitting and receiving equipment) and the space segment (the satellite itself).

Statement 2 is also correct.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) plays a crucial role in managing and allocating radio frequencies and orbital slots for satellite operators worldwide to prevent interference and ensure efficient use of the limited resources in space.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) handles licensing for telecommunication services in India, the licensing of broadcasting services falls under the purview of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.  The statement incorrectly merges these two distinct domains.


**8. With reference to the FLAMINGO Project, consider the following statements:**

1. FLAMINGO is a project focused on cosmological supercomputer simulations, aiming to interpret next-generation observations.
2. The Virgo Consortium, founded in 1994, is the primary international collaboration behind the FLAMINGO Project.
3.  FLAMINGO primarily uses small-scale simulations to study the formation of individual galaxies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only

Statement 2 is also correct. FEA is a powerful technique used extensively for analyzing and predicting the behavior of structures under various loads and conditions. FEAST's application to diverse structures such as rockets, aircraft, and buildings reflects its versatility.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the exact licensing details of FEAST are not specified, the text suggests that it's likely to be used internally within ISRO and potentially shared with other Indian space and research institutions, not commercially available to the general public or other industries.


**10. With reference to Betelgeuse, consider the following statements:**

1. Betelgeuse, also known as ‘Thiruvathirai’ or ‘Ardra’ in Indian astronomy, is a star located in the constellation Orion.
2. Betelgeuse is currently in its late hydrogen-burning stage, having already consumed most of its helium.
3.  Betelgeuse's eventual fate will likely be the formation of a neutron star or a black hole.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Betelgeuse's identification as a star in the Orion constellation and its alternative names in Indian astronomy are accurate.  It's a well-known and easily identifiable star in the night sky.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage indicates that Betelgeuse has already consumed both hydrogen and helium, placing it in its late carbon-burning stage, not hydrogen-burning. This detail is crucial for understanding its evolutionary phase.

Statement 3 is correct.  As a massive star, Betelgeuse will ultimately end its life in a supernova explosion.  The core's collapse after the exhaustion of nuclear fuel will lead to the formation of either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the remnant's mass.


**11. With reference to Near-Space, consider the following statements:**

1. Near-Space is a region extending from 18 km to 100 km above sea level, characterized by thin air and strong gravity.
2. China has established a Near-Space Command for its hypersonic weapons force, recognizing its strategic importance.
3. Systems operating in Near-Space can have significantly longer operational durations compared to Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is correct. Neuralink's successful installation of a wireless BCI implant in a human patient and the prior FDA approval for human trials are accurately reported. This represents a major milestone in the field of neurotechnology.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Neuralink's stated goal is to create a significantly more advanced BCI than those currently approved, with a substantially higher number of brain connections.  This increased connectivity is essential for more sophisticated control and data transmission.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While BCI technology is currently being used to help restore basic motor functions for people with paralysis, the potential applications of BCI extend far beyond this.  Research is actively exploring the possibility of cognitive enhancement and other advanced applications of BCIs.  The statement is an oversimplification and does not reflect the potential of the technology.


**13. With reference to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), consider the following statements:**

1. Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms like bacteria evolve mechanisms to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs.
2. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics are primary drivers of antimicrobial resistance.
3.  Antimicrobial resistance primarily affects only bacterial infections and poses no threat to viral infections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Antimicrobial resistance is a well-established phenomenon where microorganisms develop mechanisms to evade or neutralize the effects of antimicrobial drugs. This leads to treatment failures and increased morbidity and mortality.

Statement 2 is also correct. The excessive use and improper use of antibiotics (and other antimicrobials) significantly accelerate the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. This misuse selects for resistant strains, leading to the emergence of "superbugs."

Statement 3 is incorrect. Antimicrobial resistance is not limited to bacteria.  It also affects other microorganisms, including fungi, parasites, and viruses (although the mechanisms differ). The statement incorrectly limits the scope of AMR and its public health implications.  Viral resistance is a growing concern.


**14.  With reference to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), consider the following statements:**

1. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are long-lasting health conditions that cannot be passed from person to person.
2.  Major NCDs include cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.
3.  NCDs are primarily confined to high-income countries and are not a significant health concern in low-income settings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NCDs, by definition, are chronic conditions that are not infectious or transmissible from one individual to another.  These diseases typically have a long duration and often require ongoing management.

Statement 2 is also correct. The list of major NCDs provided – cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes – accurately reflects the major groups of non-communicable diseases that pose significant global health challenges.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  NCDs are a global public health concern, affecting both high-income and low-income countries. While the prevalence and specific types of NCDs might vary across regions, the burden of these diseases is substantial across all socioeconomic levels.  The statement presents a severely limited perspective on the global NCD landscape.


**15. With reference to Tuberculosis (TB), consider the following statements:**

1. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs.
2.  BCG vaccination provides complete and lifelong protection against all forms of tuberculosis.
3.  Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, and the lungs are the most commonly affected organ, although it can affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine, while widely used, does not provide complete or lifelong protection against all forms of TB. Its efficacy varies depending on factors like the strain of the bacteria and the individual's immune response.  It reduces the risk of severe TB and is particularly important for protecting children.

Statement 3 is correct.  MDR-TB is defined by resistance to at least two of the most effective first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. This makes treatment more challenging and requires longer, more complex regimens.


**16. With reference to Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), consider the following statements:**

1. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped.
2.  Individuals with sickle cell trait (carrying one abnormal gene) are always symptomatic and develop severe SCD.
3.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only curative treatment for SCD.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description of SCD as a genetic disorder with abnormal hemoglobin leading to sickle-shaped red blood cells is accurate. This shape impairs oxygen transport and causes various complications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Individuals with sickle cell trait (heterozygotes) typically do not show symptoms of severe SCD.  They carry one copy of the abnormal gene and one copy of the normal gene. While they may have some mild effects, they generally do not experience the full range of complications associated with the disease.

Statement 3 is correct.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), also known as bone marrow transplant, is indeed the only currently available curative treatment for SCD.  It replaces the patient's faulty bone marrow with healthy bone marrow, which then produces normal red blood cells.


**17. With reference to Rare Diseases, consider the following statements:**

1. A rare disease is defined as a disease affecting a small number of people, typically less than 1 in 2,000 individuals.
2.  Most rare diseases are genetic in origin, but some are caused by environmental factors or infections.
3.  The National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, provides comprehensive financial assistance for all rare diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct (though the definition in the source is slightly different).  Rare diseases are characterized by low prevalence, typically affecting a small percentage of the population.  The exact threshold varies, but the general concept of low frequency is accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct. While many rare diseases have a genetic basis (inherited through families), some are caused by environmental factors, infections, or a combination of factors.  The statement accurately reflects the diversity of etiologies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NPRD, 2021, does provide financial assistance, but not for *all* rare diseases.  It categorizes rare diseases into groups based on the treatment's cost and feasibility, with different levels of financial support offered accordingly.  The statement overstates the policy's scope.


**18. With reference to Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) drugs, consider the following statements:**

1. FDC drugs contain two or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) combined in a single dosage form.
2.  FDCs require prior approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) before they can be marketed.
3.  FDCs always result in enhanced efficacy and reduced adverse effects compared to individual APIs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FDCs are indeed pharmaceutical formulations that combine two or more APIs in a single dosage form, aiming to simplify treatment regimens and potentially improve therapeutic outcomes.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The approval process for FDCs, being essentially new drug formulations, requires rigorous evaluation by regulatory authorities like the DCGI to assess their safety and efficacy before marketing.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While FDCs can offer advantages like improved compliance and convenience, they do not always guarantee enhanced efficacy or reduced adverse effects.  In some cases, the combination of APIs can lead to unexpected interactions or increased toxicity.  The statement is an overgeneralization.


**19. With reference to Generic Drugs, consider the following statements:**

1. Generic drugs are medications that contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as brand-name drugs.
2.  Generic drugs can be marketed only after the brand-name drug's patent has expired.
3.  Generic drugs undergo less rigorous testing and quality control compared to brand-name drugs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Generic drugs are bioequivalent to their brand-name counterparts, meaning they contain the same API and are expected to have the same therapeutic effect. This is a cornerstone of generic drug regulation.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Patent protection for brand-name drugs typically lasts for a specific period, and generic versions can be marketed only after this protection expires. This allows for competition and increased affordability.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Generic drugs are subject to stringent regulatory requirements regarding testing, quality control, and bioequivalence demonstration.  They must meet the same standards of safety and efficacy as brand-name drugs before they can be approved for sale.  The statement is a common misconception.


**20. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consider the following statements:**

1. JWST is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency.
2. JWST has detected fully formed galaxies earlier than predicted by the standard model of cosmology.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. JWST is indeed a collaborative effort involving three major space agencies: NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), and the Canadian Space Agency. This international collaboration reflects the scale and ambition of the project.

Statement 2 is also correct.  JWST's observations have revealed the existence of surprisingly mature galaxies in the early universe, challenging some aspects of the standard model of cosmology. This has significant implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. JWST's primary scientific mission is to observe distant galaxies, stars, and exoplanets, not to study the Earth's atmosphere and climate.  It is focused on deep-space astronomy and cosmology.  The statement fundamentally misrepresents the telescope's capabilities and objectives.



**1. Consider the following statements about Nipah Virus (NiV):**

1. NiV is a zoonotic virus primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected fruit bats of the *Pteropodidae* family and *Pteropus* genus.
2. Human-to-human transmission of NiV is exclusively possible through close contact with respiratory secretions of infected individuals.
3.  The primary method of NiV control involves the widespread culling of fruit bats to eliminate the natural reservoir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nipah virus is indeed zoonotic, with fruit bats serving as the primary natural reservoir.  Transmission to humans occurs through direct contact with infected bats or their secretions, or indirectly through consumption of contaminated food products.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While human-to-human transmission is possible, it's not exclusive to respiratory secretions.  It can also occur through contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals.  The mode of transmission is not solely respiratory.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Widespread culling of fruit bats is not a feasible or ethical approach to NiV control.  The focus should be on preventing human contact with infected bats and their excretions, promoting hygienic food handling practices, and implementing effective quarantine measures in case of outbreaks.  Targeting the natural reservoir in this manner is considered unsustainable and environmentally damaging.


**2. With reference to Hepatitis C, consider the following statements:**

1. Egypt's achievement of "gold tier" status signifies its complete eradication of Hepatitis C.
2.  Hepatitis C transmission is primarily through the reuse of inadequately sterilized medical equipment.
3. An effective vaccine is currently available for Hepatitis C, making prevention straightforward.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Egypt has made significant progress in combating Hepatitis C and achieved "gold tier" status, this doesn't indicate complete eradication. The "gold tier" likely reflects reaching a specific threshold in reducing infection rates and improving treatment access. Complete eradication is a complex long-term goal.

Statement 2 is correct.  Hepatitis C is indeed transmitted through contaminated blood, particularly via the reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment such as syringes and needles. This is especially relevant in healthcare settings.  Other modes of transmission exist but this is a major factor.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Currently, there is no vaccine available for Hepatitis C.  Treatment focuses on antiviral medications, which can successfully cure many cases, but prevention relies heavily on preventing blood-borne transmission.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Lymphatic Filariasis (LF):**

1.  LF, also known as elephantiasis, is caused by parasitic protozoa belonging to the *Filariodidea* family.
2.  The primary vector for LF transmission is the *Anopheles* mosquito.
3. The Mass Drug Administration (MDA) initiative aims to eliminate LF by 2027 through the use of antibiotics.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that LF is caused by parasitic worms, but it's more precise to say that it's caused by *nematode* parasites (roundworms) of the *Filariodidea* family, not protozoa. Protozoa are a different type of parasite. The description of the causative agent is imprecise but contains some correct information.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While mosquitoes are the vectors for LF transmission, it's not specifically the *Anopheles* mosquito.  Other mosquito species are involved in the transmission cycle of Lymphatic Filariasis.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MDA initiative uses antiparasitic drugs, not antibiotics, to eliminate LF.  Antibiotics target bacteria, while antiparasitic drugs target parasites.


**4. With reference to Avian Influenza A (H9N2) virus, consider the following statements:**

1. H9N2 is a subtype of the influenza B virus that primarily affects birds.
2. The ICAR-NIHSAD developed a vaccine for chickens against high-pathogenic avian influenza (H9N2).
3. Transmission of H9N2 to humans is exceptionally common and often leads to severe illness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  H9N2 is a subtype of influenza *A* virus, not influenza B.  Influenza A viruses affect both humans and animals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD) did develop an inactivated low-pathogenic avian influenza (H9N2) vaccine for chickens. This is crucial for controlling the spread within poultry populations.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While H9N2 can transmit to humans, it's relatively rare and usually results in mild or asymptomatic infections.  Severe human illness is not common.


**5. Consider the following statements about Genome Editing:**

1. Genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, exclusively modify existing genetic material without introducing foreign genes.
2. SDN3, a category within site-directed nucleases (SDNs), involves the incorporation of genes from foreign organisms.
3. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and gene-edited organisms are fundamentally identical in their genetic modification processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some genome editing techniques aim to modify existing genes, others, like SDN3, can introduce foreign genetic material.  The statement oversimplifies the range of techniques and their effects.

Statement 2 is correct.  SDN3, a type of site-directed nuclease-based genome editing, does involve the introduction of genes from other species. This distinguishes it from SDN1 and SDN2 which primarily modify the existing genetic material.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  GMOs and gene-edited organisms differ significantly. GMOs involve the introduction of entirely new genes from different species, while gene editing primarily modifies existing genes within the organism.  The processes and resulting genetic makeup are distinct.


**6. With reference to Three-Parent Babies and Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), consider the following statements:**

1. MDT involves the use of nuclear genetic material from both parents and mitochondrial material from a donor.
2.  The primary goal of MDT is to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from the mother to the offspring.
3. MDT procedures always involve the creation of an embryo from the biological parents before the introduction of donated mitochondria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  MDT utilizes the nuclear DNA from both biological parents and healthy mitochondria from a donor to create an embryo free from mitochondrial diseases,  combining genetic material from three individuals.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary aim of MDT is to prevent the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases from the mother, ensuring the child inherits healthy mitochondria.  This is done by replacing defective maternal mitochondria with healthy ones.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MDT procedures can be performed either before or after in-vitro fertilization (IVF).  The timing of mitochondrial introduction relative to the embryo creation varies depending on the specific technique used.


**7. Consider the following statements about Stem Cells:**

1. Stem cells are specialized cells that cannot divide and differentiate into other cell types.
2. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are derived from embryonic sources.
3. Stem cell therapy can involve both autologous and allogeneic transplantation methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Stem cells are *unspecialized* cells with the capacity to divide and differentiate into various specialized cell types. This is their defining characteristic.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are generated from adult cells, typically skin cells or blood cells, which are reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state. They are not directly derived from embryos.

Statement 3 is correct. Stem cell therapy can utilize either autologous transplantation (using the patient's own stem cells) or allogeneic transplantation (using stem cells from a donor).  Both methods are employed, depending on the clinical context.

3.  The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) assesses proposals for the commercial release of all genetically modified organisms, including those created through genome editing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Genome editing differs from genetic modification (GM) in its approach. Genome editing modifies an organism's existing genetic material to improve traits, while GM introduces foreign genes.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a prime example of a genome editing tool that precisely targets and alters specific DNA sequences within the organism's genome.  GMOs, on the other hand, involve the insertion of genes from a different species, creating a transgenic organism.

Statement 2 is also correct. SDN1 and SDN2 are categories of genome editing that utilize site-directed nucleases to make precise changes within the organism's DNA.  Critically, these methods *do not* introduce foreign genetic material. The resulting organism is genetically similar to those produced through conventional breeding techniques, making them difficult to distinguish.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While GEAC does assess genetically modified organisms (GMOs), its purview primarily focuses on organisms with foreign genes introduced.  The regulatory landscape for genome-edited organisms, particularly those using SDN1 and SDN2 methods, is evolving and may differ from the regulations governing traditional GMOs.  The regulatory approach varies across countries and depends on the specific techniques used and the nature of the genetic changes introduced.  Therefore, it's inaccurate to state that GEAC assesses *all* genome-edited organisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), also known as three-parent IVF, combines the nuclear genetic material from the intended parents with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. This process creates an embryo with the parents' nuclear DNA but with healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor, circumventing the inheritance of potentially harmful mitochondrial mutations.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of MDT is to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from the mother to her offspring. Mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited solely from the mother.  By replacing the mother's diseased mtDNA with healthy mtDNA from a donor, MDT aims to eliminate the risk of transmitting these potentially debilitating conditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) is one technique used in MDT, it is not the exclusive method.  Another common technique is Pronuclear Transfer (PNT), which offers an alternative approach to replacing the mother's mtDNA with healthy mtDNA from a donor.  Both MST and PNT aim to achieve the same goal of preventing mitochondrial disease transmission, but they differ in their technical approaches.
