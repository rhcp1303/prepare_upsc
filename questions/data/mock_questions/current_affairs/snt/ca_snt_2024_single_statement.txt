Unlike FSOC which uses light beams over longer distances, LiFi operates in the visible or near-infrared light spectrum within enclosed spaces, often indoors.  It leverages the existing lighting infrastructure (LED lights) to transmit data, offering high speeds and secure communication.  Options (a), (b), and (d) utilize different transmission methods; FSOC uses light beams over longer distances, 5G uses radio waves, and Wi-Fi 7 utilizes radio frequencies.  LiFi's unique use of light for short-range, indoor data transmission makes (c) the correct answer.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills.  The correct answer and a detailed explanation are provided for each.


**1.  Which genetic engineering technique modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance, increasing the likelihood that a particular suite of genes will be passed onto the next generation, and utilizes a Cas9 enzyme and CRISPR technology?**

(a)  Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)
(b)  Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)
(c)  Gene-drive technology (GDT)
(d)  Recombinant DNA technology


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gene-drive technology (GDT) is specifically designed to alter the normal Mendelian inheritance patterns. It achieves this by incorporating genetic material encoding for a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (acting as molecular scissors), and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) into an organism's DNA.  This engineered genetic system biases inheritance, making it far more likely that the modified gene will be passed on to offspring, even if it would normally be recessive. ZFNs and TALENs are other genome editing techniques, but they do not inherently alter Mendelian inheritance in the same targeted way as GDT. Recombinant DNA technology is a broader technique that involves gene transfer but doesn't intrinsically manipulate inheritance patterns to the same degree.


**2.  A rare blood clotting disorder, congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP), is now treatable with a newly approved therapy. What type of treatment utilizes a genetically engineered protein product for on-demand treatment of this condition?**

(a)  Gene therapy
(b)  Stem cell therapy
(c)  Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
(d)  Immunotherapy


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question describes the use of a recombinant (genetically engineered) protein product for treating cTTP. This directly points to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).  ERT involves providing patients with missing or malfunctioning enzymes.  In this case, the genetically engineered protein acts as the replacement enzyme. Gene therapy involves introducing genes into cells to treat a disease, while stem cell therapy uses stem cells to repair or replace damaged tissues. Immunotherapy uses the body's immune system to fight disease. None of these other options directly address the use of a genetically engineered protein for enzyme replacement.


**3.  What is the primary difference between Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and Gene Editing technologies in terms of genetic material modification?**

(a)  GMOs modify existing genetic material, while gene editing introduces entirely new genetic material.
(b)  Gene editing modifies existing genetic material, while GMOs introduce foreign genes.
(c)  Both techniques introduce foreign genes, but GMOs use more complex methods.
(d)  Both techniques modify existing genetic material, but GMOs are more precise.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The crucial distinction lies in the source of the genetic modification. Gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR, modify the organism's existing genetic material by making targeted changes or edits.  GMOs, on the other hand, introduce entirely new genes (transgenes) from different species into the organism's genome. Option (a) reverses the correct relationship. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the fundamental difference between the two approaches.


**4.  Which Indian governmental body is responsible for granting environmental clearance for the commercial cultivation of Genetically Modified (GM) crops, operating under the Environmental Protection Act of 1986?**

(a)  Department of Biotechnology (DBT)
(b)  Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO)
(c)  Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)
(d)  National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), established under the Environmental Protection Act of 1986, is the specific regulatory body in India responsible for evaluating the environmental safety of GM crops before commercial cultivation is allowed.  The DBT plays a role in biotechnology research and development but doesn't directly handle environmental clearances. CDSCO focuses on drugs and pharmaceuticals, and the NBA deals with biodiversity conservation.  Therefore, only GEAC fits the description.

(a)  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
(b)  Genome sequencing
(c)  DNA fingerprinting
(d)  Karyotyping


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Genome sequencing is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism. It involves identifying the order of the four nucleotide bases (A, C, G, and T) in the genome.  The question highlights the use of both short-read and long-read techniques, a key characteristic of genome sequencing.  PCR is a technique for amplifying DNA, DNA fingerprinting is used for identification, and karyotyping involves visualizing chromosomes.  These methods do not directly determine the nucleotide sequence of the entire genome. The long-read technique's utility in handling repetitive sequences in the Y chromosome further points to genome sequencing.


**6.  What is the primary function of mitochondria in cells, and why is mitochondrial DNA exclusively inherited from the mother?**

(a)  Protein synthesis; because sperm mitochondria are destroyed during fertilization.
(b)  Energy generation; because the vast majority of mitochondria in the zygote originate from the egg cell.
(c)  Waste removal; because the egg cell provides the primary cytoplasmic components.
(d)  DNA replication; because the mother's DNA is more stable.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for generating energy through cellular respiration.  Maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA arises because the vast majority of mitochondria in the fertilized egg (zygote) come from the egg cell. Sperm mitochondria are typically degraded during fertilization, resulting in the offspring inheriting only the mother's mitochondrial DNA. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the primary function of mitochondria and the mechanism of mitochondrial inheritance.

(d)  SDN 1, SDN 2, and SDN 3 gene editing techniques all involve the introduction of alien genetic material.


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The core difference between gene editing and GMOs lies in their approach to genetic modification. Gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR, ZFNs, and TALENs, modify an organism's existing genetic material to enhance its characteristics.  They work by precisely altering or removing specific genes within the organism's genome.  In contrast, GMOs involve the introduction of foreign genes (transgenes) from a different species into the target organism's genome. This transgene expression leads to the desired trait.  While both methods aim for quality improvement, they achieve it through fundamentally different mechanisms. Option (a) is incorrect because only GMOs utilize foreign genes. Option (c) is partially true as GMOs require GEAC clearance, but gene editing, particularly SDN 1 and SDN 2, may not always require the same level of scrutiny depending on the nature of the edits and regulatory frameworks. Option (d) is false as SDN 1 and SDN 2 do not involve alien genetic material.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for comprehending the ongoing debates surrounding genetic modification in agriculture and biotechnology.

**4. Which of the following accurately describes a key difference between short-read and long-read genome sequencing techniques?**

(a) Short-read sequencing is more effective for assembling complex genomes with repetitive sequences.
(b) Long-read sequencing breaks the genome into smaller fragments before sequencing.
(c) Short-read sequencing provides longer, more easily assembled sequences.
(d) Long-read sequencing is better suited for applications like counting specific sequences.


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Short-read and long-read sequencing are two distinct approaches to genome sequencing that differ significantly in their methodology and applications. Short-read sequencing fragments the genome into many small pieces (typically 50-300 bases) before sequencing. This approach is highly efficient for determining the abundance of specific sequences and profiling gene expression. However, assembling complex genomes with repetitive sequences becomes challenging due to the difficulty in accurately ordering these small fragments. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, generates longer sequences, making it easier to assemble genomes with repetitive regions.  Therefore, option (a) is correct as short-read sequencing is less effective for complex, repetitive genomes. Option (b) is incorrect; long-read does not break the genome into smaller fragments *before* sequencing, but it does fragment and tag the DNA to track fragments. Option (c) is incorrect as long-read provides longer sequences. Option (d) is incorrect as short-read is better for counting specific sequences. The choice between short-read and long-read depends on the specific research question and the complexity of the genome being sequenced.


**5.  Regarding the applications of Gene Drive Technology (GDT), which statement is true?**

(a) GDT has not shown any significant impact on mosquito populations.
(b) GDT is a genetic engineering technique that does not alter Mendelian inheritance patterns.
(c) GDT utilizes CRISPR technology, but not Cas9 enzyme.
(d) GDT aims to increase the likelihood that specific genes will be passed on to the next generation.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gene Drive Technology (GDT) is a powerful genetic engineering technique designed to modify genes and overcome normal Mendelian inheritance patterns.  Unlike standard inheritance where a gene has a 50% chance of being passed on, GDT increases the probability of a specific gene's transmission to subsequent generations. This makes option (d) correct. This is achieved by incorporating genetic material encoding for a gene, Cas9 enzyme (acting as molecular scissors), and CRISPR (repetitive DNA sequences) into an organism's DNA.  The Cas9 enzyme, guided by CRISPR, cuts the DNA at a specific location, allowing the desired gene to be inserted or modified, increasing its inheritance likelihood. Option (a) is incorrect as GDT applications have shown promising reductions in mosquito populations. Option (b) is incorrect as GDT alters Mendelian inheritance. Option (c) is incorrect; GDT utilizes both CRISPR and Cas9.  The potential applications of GDT are vast, ranging from controlling invasive species to eradicating disease vectors, but ethical concerns remain regarding its potential unintended consequences.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on Science and Technology.  Each question is designed to be challenging and assesses various cognitive skills, with a detailed explanation for each correct answer.


**1.  A novel gene-editing technique modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, increasing the likelihood that specific genes are passed to the next generation. This technique utilizes a gene, the Cas9 enzyme, and CRISPR. Which technology best fits this description?**

(a) Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)
(b) Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)
(c) Gene-drive technology (GDT)
(d) Recombinant DNA technology


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes gene-drive technology (GDT). GDT is a genetic engineering technique that alters Mendelian inheritance by increasing the probability of specific gene transmission to offspring.  It uses three key components: a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (acting as molecular scissors), and CRISPR (repetitive DNA sequences). ZFNs and TALENs are other genome editing techniques, but they don't specifically focus on altering Mendelian inheritance in the way GDT does. Recombinant DNA technology involves transferring genes across species but doesn't inherently modify inheritance patterns like GDT.


**2.  A rare blood clotting disorder, congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP), is now treatable with a newly approved therapy. This therapy utilizes a genetically engineered protein product for on-demand treatment. What type of therapy is this?**

**6.  The concept of Lagrangian points in space is crucial for placing satellites. Which statement about Lagrangian points is INCORRECT?**

(a) There are five Lagrangian points (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5) in a two-body gravitational system.
(b) L1, L2, and L3 are unstable Lagrangian points.
(c) L4 and L5 are stable Lagrangian points.
(d)  Lagrange points require significant fuel consumption to maintain a satellite's position.


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Lagrangian points are positions in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies (like the Sun and Earth) and the centrifugal force balance each other. This allows a smaller object (a satellite) to remain relatively stationary at these points with minimal fuel consumption.  The stability of these points varies; L1, L2, and L3 are unstable, while L4 and L5 are relatively stable.  Therefore, statement (d) is incorrect because a key advantage of Lagrangian points is the reduced fuel needed for station-keeping.


**7.  Nuclear fusion is a promising clean energy source. What is the main challenge that currently prevents the widespread commercial application of nuclear fusion power?**

(a) The scarcity of suitable fusion fuels.
(b) Achieving Net Energy Gain (NEG), where the energy produced exceeds the energy consumed.

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test various cognitive skills and avoid simple guessing.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1.  A viral disease primarily affecting cattle, characterized by fever and skin nodules, occasionally leading to mortality and reduced milk production, has spread from Africa to various regions globally. Which vector is NOT primarily associated with its transmission?**

(a) Certain species of flies
(b) Specific types of mosquitoes
(c) Ticks
(d) Fleas


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The question focuses on the transmission of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD). The passage explicitly states that LSD is transmitted by blood-feeding insects like certain flies and mosquitoes, or ticks.  Fleas are not mentioned as vectors for LSD. While other arthropods might theoretically play a minor role in transmission, the passage clearly highlights flies, mosquitoes, and ticks as the primary vectors.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is (d).  Options (a), (b), and (c) are directly supported by the provided text. The inclusion of "fleas" as a distractor option tests the candidate's precise understanding of the disease's transmission mechanisms and their ability to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant vectors.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify incorrect information.


**2.  A viral liver infection with a significant global prevalence exceeding that of HIV, often exhibiting asymptomatic periods, lacks a vaccine but is treatable with antiviral medications. This description best fits which viral infection?**

(a) Hepatitis A
(b) Hepatitis B
(c) Hepatitis C
(d) Nipah Virus


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The question describes Hepatitis C. The passage explicitly states that Hepatitis B and C have a higher global prevalence than HIV, that some infected individuals remain asymptomatic for years, and that there's no vaccine for Hepatitis C but antiviral treatment is available. Hepatitis A and B have effective vaccines, making (a) and (b) incorrect.  Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus with a different mode of transmission and clinical presentation, eliminating (d). This question tests factual recall about the characteristics of different viral infections, requiring the candidate to synthesize information from the text to identify the correct match.  The close relationship between Hepatitis B and C in the passage creates a challenging distractor.

**1.  A novel gene-editing technique alters Mendelian inheritance patterns to increase the likelihood of specific gene transmission to offspring.  This technology utilizes a specific enzyme and repetitive DNA sequences. Which technology is being described?**

(a) Genome Sequencing
(b) Enzyme Replacement Therapy
(c) Gene-Drive Technology
(d) Recombinant DNA Technology

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly points to Gene-Drive Technology (GDT). GDT manipulates genes to deviate from typical Mendelian inheritance, aiming to enhance the probability of specific gene transmission to subsequent generations.  The mention of a "molecular scissor" (Cas9 enzyme) and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) further solidifies this. Genome sequencing determines the order of DNA nucleotides; Enzyme Replacement Therapy involves supplying missing or deficient enzymes; and Recombinant DNA Technology combines DNA from different sources.  These processes do not directly manipulate inheritance patterns in the way GDT does.  The core function of GDT is to bias inheritance, making option (c) the only accurate choice.


**2.  A method involves figuring out the order of DNA nucleotides (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine) in a genome, encompassing all chromosomes and genes.  This process can be achieved using either short-read or long-read techniques, with the latter being particularly useful for complex chromosomes.  What is this method called?**

(a) Genome Editing
(b) Gene-Drive Technology
(c) Genome Sequencing
(d) Recombinant DNA Technology

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes genome sequencing. The detailed explanation of determining the order of DNA bases and the mention of short-read and long-read techniques directly relate to the process of sequencing a genome. Genome editing modifies the DNA sequence, gene-drive technology enhances specific gene inheritance, and recombinant DNA technology combines DNA from different sources. While these are related to genetics, they do not directly address the process of determining the precise order of DNA bases within a complete genome, which is the defining characteristic of genome sequencing. The contrast between short-read and long-read techniques further highlights the specificity of genome sequencing.


**3.  A procedure involves combining the genetic material of parents with mitochondrial material from a donor to conceive a child via IVF. This technique aims to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from the mother. What is this procedure known as?**

(a)  Enzyme Replacement Therapy
(b)  Three-Parent Baby
(c) Cell-free DNA Technology
(d)  Maternal Spindle Transfer

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description accurately describes the "Three-Parent Baby" procedure (also known as Mitochondrial Donation Treatment or MRT).  The procedure utilizes genetic material from two parents and mitochondrial DNA from a donor, thus involving three individuals' genetic material in the creation of the child.  This method specifically targets mitochondrial diseases, inheritable through the maternal line.  Enzyme replacement therapy addresses enzyme deficiencies, cell-free DNA technology focuses on DNA fragments in bodily fluids, and maternal spindle transfer is a specific technique *within* the broader mitochondrial replacement process. The question's focus on the involvement of three individuals' genetic material and the prevention of mitochondrial diseases makes "Three-Parent Baby" the most fitting answer.


**4.  A type of medical treatment utilizes replacement enzymes for patients suffering from conditions stemming from enzyme deficiencies or malfunctions.  This therapy is becoming increasingly important in treating rare genetic disorders.  What is this treatment called?**

(a) Gene-Drive Technology
(b) Genome Sequencing
(c) Enzyme Replacement Therapy
(d) Recombinant DNA Technology

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly matches Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT). ERT directly addresses enzyme deficiencies by providing the missing or malfunctioning enzymes to patients. The other options are not directly related to enzyme replacement. Gene-drive technology manipulates gene inheritance, genome sequencing determines the order of DNA bases, and recombinant DNA technology combines DNA from different sources.  These technologies are crucial in genetic research and medicine, but they don't address the core function of replacing deficient enzymes to treat specific medical conditions, which is the defining characteristic of ERT.


**5. A technology uses a highly focused laser beam to manipulate microscopic objects, enabling researchers to study their structural details. This technique finds applications in various scientific fields, including the study of biological systems. What is this technology called?**

(a)  Nanophotonic Electron Accelerator

(c)  CRISPR-Cas9
(d)  Electron Microscopy

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description precisely defines optical tweezers.  Optical tweezers employ a focused laser beam to trap and manipulate microscopic objects, allowing for detailed studies of their structure and properties. The application in biological systems is a key feature often highlighted in descriptions of optical tweezers.  A Nanophotonic Electron Accelerator is a particle accelerator, CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing tool, and electron microscopy uses electrons to image samples. While all these technologies are valuable in scientific research, only optical tweezers directly use a focused laser beam to manipulate microscopic objects for detailed studies, making (b) the most accurate answer.


**6.  A type of highly energetic explosion in the universe, these events are the most powerful known and can temporarily affect Earth's ozone layer.  They are often associated with the birth of black holes and collisions of neutron stars. What are these events?**

(a) Fast Radio Bursts
(b) Gamma-Ray Bursts
(c) Supernovae
(d)  Solar Flares

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description clearly refers to Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). GRBs are characterized as the most powerful explosions in the universe, emitting intense high-energy radiation and often linked to the formation of black holes and neutron star mergers.  The mention of their potential impact on the ozone layer further points towards GRBs. Fast Radio Bursts are brief bursts of radio waves, supernovae are stellar explosions marking the end of a star's life, and solar flares are explosions on the Sun's surface. While these events are energetic, only GRBs fit the description of the most powerful explosions known and their potential to affect the Earth’s ozone layer.


**7.  A recently discovered asteroid maintains a stable orbit around the Sun, similar to Earth's orbital period, but is only slightly influenced by Earth's gravity.  This type of celestial body is categorized as a temporary companion to Earth. What is this type of celestial body called?**

(a) Trojan Asteroid
(b) Near-Earth Asteroid
(c) Quasi-moon
(d)  Main Belt Asteroid

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The description accurately describes a quasi-moon. Quasi-moons share a similar orbital period with a planet (in this case, Earth) but are only weakly gravitationally bound to it, resulting in a temporary, less stable association. Trojan asteroids share an orbit with a planet, near-Earth asteroids pass close to Earth, and main belt asteroids reside in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.  These orbital characteristics do not match the description of a celestial body in a stable orbit around the sun like Earth but only weakly influenced by Earth's gravity, which is the defining characteristic of a quasi-moon.


**8.  These fundamental particles are incredibly light, carry no charge, and have a half-spin.  They rarely interact with matter, making them difficult to detect, and are produced by various cosmic events and radioactive decay. What are these particles?**

(a) Photons
(b) Gluons
(c) Neutrinos
(d)  Bosons

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description precisely defines neutrinos.  Neutrinos are known for their extremely small mass, lack of charge, and half-integral spin. Their weak interaction with matter is a defining characteristic often referred to as "ghost particles."  Photons are force carriers of electromagnetism, gluons mediate the strong force, and bosons are a broader class of particles including force carriers. While these are all fundamental particles, only neutrinos exhibit the specific properties of being nearly massless, chargeless, and having a half-spin, along with their minimal interaction with matter.


**9.  This technology involves creating dense urban forests in a small area, using a mix of native, fast-growing plant species. The methodology is designed to promote self-sustainability and minimal maintenance.  What is this technology called?**

(a)  Agroforestry
(b) Miyawaki forest
(c)  Permaculture
(d)  Afforestation

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description accurately describes the Miyawaki method of forest creation.  The Miyawaki method focuses on creating dense, diverse, and self-sustaining urban forests in compact spaces, employing native plant species and aiming for minimal ongoing maintenance. Agroforestry integrates trees and crops, permaculture is a holistic design system, and afforestation is the general process of establishing forests. While these have some overlap with the Miyawaki method's goals, only the Miyawaki method explicitly addresses the creation of dense, quickly growing, self-sustaining urban forests in small areas.

(b) Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)
(c) Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)
(d) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly lists CRISPR, ZFNs, and TALENs as genome editing techniques.  PCR, while a crucial molecular biology technique used in many genetic research applications, is not a genome editing technique itself. PCR amplifies DNA sequences, but it doesn't directly alter or modify the genome. Genome editing involves precise manipulation of the DNA sequence, whereas PCR is a DNA copying method.  ZFNs and TALENs are older gene editing techniques than CRISPR, all three offering targeted modification of DNA.  Therefore, PCR is the only option that is not a method of genome editing.  Understanding the distinction between DNA amplification (PCR) and DNA modification (genome editing) is crucial for grasping the nuances of modern biotechnology.

(b) Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
(c) Proof-of-Authority (PoA)
(d) Proof-of-Burn (PoB)

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism in which the selection of validators and the addition of new blocks to the blockchain are determined by the number of tokens a user holds. This contrasts with Proof-of-Work (PoW), where network security and block validation depend on computationally intensive mining processes.  PoW algorithms, such as the one used by Bitcoin, require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks, consuming significant energy. PoS, on the other hand, distributes network control among token holders, reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency.  Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and Proof-of-Burn (PoB) are less prevalent alternatives with different validation mechanisms, making them less relevant to the comparison presented in the question. Therefore, PoS is the most fitting answer due to its direct contrast with PoW in terms of network control and validation methods.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Crypto mining in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network involves the use of powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems. This process serves two crucial purposes: the generation of new coins and the verification and processing of transactions on the blockchain. By solving these problems, miners add new blocks of validated transactions to the blockchain, securing the network and earning newly minted coins as a reward.  Options (a), (c), and (d) describe functions that are related to cryptocurrencies but are not the primary function of crypto mining in a PoW system.  Encryption is a separate security measure, decentralized exchanges operate independently of the mining process, and the development of cryptographic algorithms is a separate field of research. Therefore, generating new coins and verifying transactions is the core function of crypto mining within a PoW network.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Security tokens represent ownership or a stake in a real-world asset or enterprise. They function similarly to traditional securities like stocks or bonds, granting holders certain rights and privileges associated with the underlying asset.  This contrasts with utility tokens, which provide access to a product, service, or platform.  Stablecoins maintain a relatively stable value, and NFTs represent unique digital assets.  Therefore, security tokens are the most accurate answer due to their representation of ownership in real-world assets, distinguishing them from the other token types.


**10. Which quantum computing principle allows qubits to represent 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling calculations beyond the capabilities of classical computing which uses transistors to represent only either 0 or 1?**

(a) Quantum Entanglement
(b) Quantum Superposition
(c) Quantum Tunneling
(d) Quantum Coherence

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that allows a qubit to exist in multiple states (0 and 1) simultaneously.  This contrasts sharply with classical computing, where bits can represent only one state at a time (either 0 or 1).  Quantum superposition enables quantum computers to perform calculations that are exponentially faster than classical computers for certain types of problems.  Quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and quantum coherence are other important concepts in quantum computing, but they do not directly address the ability of qubits to represent multiple states at once. Therefore, quantum superposition is the most accurate answer.

(a)  World Trade Organization (WTO)
(b)  International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
(c)  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)
(d)  United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is the international food standards body jointly created by WHO and FAO. Its primary mandate is to develop and promote international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in international food trade.  The CAC's work is recognized by the WTO under the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), making its standards influential in global food regulation.  The other organizations, while involved in international trade or standards setting, do not have the specific mandate and joint creation by WHO and FAO that defines the CAC. Therefore, the CAC is the most appropriate answer.


**13. Which technology uses algorithms to replace a person in a video or image with someone else, creating realistic-looking but fabricated content, often employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?**

(a)  Facial Recognition
(b)  Deepfakes
(c)  Image Compression
(d)  Digital Watermarking

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Deepfakes are synthetic media created using artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep learning algorithms, to manipulate existing videos or images.  The process often involves Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which consist of two neural networks—a generator that creates fake content and a discriminator that evaluates its realism.  Deepfakes can be used to replace a person's face or body in a video, creating convincing but false narratives.  Facial recognition technology identifies individuals in images, image compression reduces file size, and digital watermarking embeds invisible identifiers.  Therefore, deepfakes are the most accurate answer due to their use of AI to generate realistic but fabricated media.
