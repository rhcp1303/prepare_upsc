Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require a strong understanding of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. Free Drugs Service Initiative                : Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
3. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme   : Department of Pharmaceuticals
4. NAMSTE portal                              :  Central Drugs Standard Control Organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) falls under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The Free Drugs Service Initiative is indeed a program of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals is implemented by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, which is under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.  NAMSTE (National Ayush Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic) portal is not associated with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO).  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                         Treatment/Initiative
1. Tyrosinemia-Type 1                             : Enzyme Replacement Therapy
2. Gaucher's Disease                               :  Production Linked Incentive Scheme
3. Dravet Syndrome                               :  National Health Mission
4.  Sickle Cell Disease                             : CRISPR-based Gene Therapies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tyrosinemia-Type 1 is a rare disease, and while enzyme replacement therapy might be a part of its management, it's not the exclusive or primary treatment method.  The Production Linked Incentive Scheme is relevant to pharmaceutical production and might indirectly support the development of treatments for Gaucher's Disease, but it's not a direct treatment. Dravet Syndrome is managed under various healthcare initiatives but primarily falls under the remit of specialized neurological care, not solely the National Health Mission. The recent approval of CRISPR-based gene therapies for Sickle Cell Disease makes this pair a correct match.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 have a strong direct correlation.



**3. With reference to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), consider the following pairs:**

   Module/Component                        Content/Focus
1. Module 1                                  : Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (ASU)
2. Module 2                                  : Traditional medicine conditions from ancient China
3. Supplementary chapter on traditional medicine: Encompasses over 500 codes, including infectious and lifestyle diseases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Module 1 of ICD-11 focuses on traditional medicine conditions originating in ancient China, while Module 2 is dedicated to Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. The supplementary chapter on traditional medicine does indeed encompass over 500 codes, including both infectious and lifestyle diseases. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Food Fortification, consider the following pairs:**

   Nutrient                                   Source/Method
1. Iron                                        : Biofortification of rice
2. Vitamin B9 (folic acid)                     : Fortified rice kernels (FRKs)
3. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)              : Post-harvest addition to rice
4. Micronutrients                             :  Agronomic practices


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Iron can be obtained through biofortification (breeding nutrients into crops) but is also added to fortified rice kernels.  Vitamin B9 (folic acid) and Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) are indeed key micronutrients added to FRKs as part of the fortification process. This fortification is a post-harvest method.  While agronomic practices can influence micronutrient content in crops, they are not the direct method of food fortification described in the text. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 directly reflect the information provided.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Trans Fat                          Source
1. Naturally-occurring trans-fats             : Commercially baked foods
2. Industrially-produced trans-fats          : Some dairy and meat products
3. Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)           : Hydrogenation of vegetable oil


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Naturally occurring trans fats are found in some dairy and meat products, not commercially baked foods. Industrially produced trans fats are indeed formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oil, and partially hydrogenated oil (PHO) is a direct result of this process. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                 Key Feature/Application
1. Wi-Fi 7                                    : Four times faster than Wi-Fi 6
2. 3D Printing                               : Subtractive manufacturing process
3.  Facial Recognition Technology            :  Used in Sanchar Saathi Initiative
4.  Blockchain Technology                     : Centralized data management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 is indeed significantly faster than Wi-Fi 6. 3D printing is an additive, not subtractive, manufacturing process. Facial recognition technology is a key component of the Sanchar Saathi initiative. Blockchain technology is characterized by its decentralized nature, not centralized data management. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7.  With reference to Rare Diseases, consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                     Category under NPRD, 2021
1.  Gaucher's Disease                         : Group 1 (One-time curative treatment)
2.  Wilson’s Disease                           : Group 2 (Long-term/lifelong treatment, lower cost)
3.  Dravet Syndrome                           : Group 3 (Very high cost, lifelong therapy)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The categorization of these rare diseases under the National Policy for Rare Diseases (NPRD), 2021, is complex and not always straightforwardly defined by a single characteristic.  While some sources might suggest certain groupings, a definitive and universally accepted classification for these specific diseases under the NPRD's three groups is not consistently available. Therefore, none of the pairs can be confirmed as 100% correctly matched based on readily available information.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Technology                          Description/Characteristic
1.  Biosimilar                                 : Made in a non-living system
2.  Biofortification                            : Post-harvest nutrient addition
3.  Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) drugs        : Contain only one API
4.  Generic Drugs                               : Marketed only after patent expiry


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Biosimilars are very similar in structure and function to biological medicines (made in living systems). Biofortification is the process of breeding nutrients into crops, not a post-harvest method. Fixed dose combination drugs contain more than one active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). While generic drugs *can* be marketed after patent expiry, compulsory licensing allows for earlier marketing in certain circumstances.  Therefore, only statement 4 is a completely accurate representation.



**9. With reference to Nuclear Technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type                                  Fuel/Coolant
1.  Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)   :  Enriched Uranium
2.  Small Modular Reactor (SMR)                : Helium
3.  JT-60SA                                    : Natural Uranium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PHWRs use natural uranium as fuel, not enriched uranium. SMRs, particularly fourth-generation ones, often utilize helium as a coolant. The JT-60SA is an experimental fusion reactor and does not directly utilize uranium as fuel.  Therefore only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                       Focus Area
1.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI):  Regulating non-sugar sweeteners
2.  World Health Organization (WHO)             :  Trans-fat elimination
3.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)        : Setting standards for spices only
4.  National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA): Fixing retail prices of essential medicines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

FSSAI does regulate non-sugar sweeteners. WHO is indeed involved in the trans-fat elimination program.  The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) sets standards for a wide range of food products, not only spices. NPPA is responsible for fixing the retail prices of essential medicines.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Key Feature/Application
1.  Facial Recognition Technology : Used in Sanchar Saathi Initiative for SIM verification
2.  Wi-Fi 7                       : Based on IEEE 802.11be standard

4.  Free Space Optical Communication: Uses Visible Light Communication (VLC) principle

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sanchar Saathi initiative leverages AI-powered facial recognition technology for telecom SIM subscriber verification, making statement 1 correct. Wi-Fi 7, as the next-generation Wi-Fi standard, is indeed based on the IEEE 802.11be (extremely high throughput) standard, validating statement 2.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While 5G utilizes Sub-6 GHz frequencies, its use of frequencies ranging from 95 GHz to 3 THz (Terahertz) is a characteristic of 6G, not 5G.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) is an outdoor optical wireless communication method. While it can achieve high data rates, its core principle isn't VLC (Visible Light Communication), which is primarily associated with indoor, short-distance optical wireless communication (LiFi).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supercomputer                  Characteristic/Project
1.  AIRAWAT                        : Ranked 75th in the Top 500 Global Supercomputing List
2.  PARAM Siddhi-AI                :  First supercomputer assembled indigenously in 2019
3.  PARAM 8000                    : Installed under National Program on Artificial Intelligence (NPAI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

AIRAWAT, India's largest and fastest AI supercomputing system, is correctly matched with its ranking in the Top 500 Global Supercomputing List (statement 1). Pratyush is also correctly listed as one of India's supercomputers featured in the Top 500 list (statement 4). However, statement 2 is incorrect; PARAM Shivay, not PARAM Siddhi-AI, was the first supercomputer assembled indigenously in India in 2019.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; AIRAWAT, not PARAM 8000, was installed under the National Program on Artificial Intelligence (NPAI).  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Associated Concept/Initiative
1.  Digital India RISC-V Microprocessor (DIR-V): Aims to create next-generation microprocessors
2.  Blockchain Technology           : Uses proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm exclusively

4.  Over-the-Top (OTT) Services   : Requires a license from the Union Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The DIR-V program's objective is to enable the creation of next-generation microprocessors in India, making statement 1 correct.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; blockchain technology utilizes both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms, not exclusively PoS.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while TRAI plays a significant role in Net Neutrality, the TDSAT's jurisdiction over OTT platforms has been clarified to be limited.  Statement 4 is false; OTT streaming platforms do not require a license from the Union Government.  Thus, only statement 1 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Characteristic/Application
1.  OLED                           : Uses a series of organic thin films between two conductors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

OLED technology uses organic thin films sandwiched between two conductors, making statement 1 accurate. Crypto mining involves verifying and securing transactions on decentralized computer networks, thus statement 3 is correct. Wi-Fi 7 does offer backward compatibility with previous Wi-Fi standards, including Wi-Fi 6, confirming statement 4. However, statement 2 is incorrect; 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, building objects layer by layer, the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which removes material.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology              Related Concept/Application
1.  Nuclear Fusion                  : Achieves Net Energy Gain (NEG) routinely in current reactors
2.  Molybdenum-99 production     : Located in Trombay Campus of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre

4.  Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS): Removes strontium from contaminated water


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The location of the Molybdenum-99 production facility in Trombay is correctly stated in pair 2.  The ALPS system's function in removing strontium from contaminated water is also accurate in pair 4. However, pair 1 is incorrect; while nuclear fusion aims to achieve Net Energy Gain (NEG), current fusion reactors do not routinely achieve this.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; uranium enrichment increases the percentage of Uranium-235, not Uranium-238, to create effective nuclear fuel.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Quantum Technology             Associated Concept/Application
1.  Quantum Computing             : Based solely on the principle of superposition
2.  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): Enables secure information sharing between parties
3.  National Quantum Mission (NQM): Aims to develop large-scale quantum computers with over 1000 qubits initially
4.  Mission Coordination Cell (MCC): Functions under the supervision of the Mission Technology Research Council (MTRC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) accurately facilitates secure information sharing, making statement 2 correct. The Mission Coordination Cell (MCC) indeed operates under the guidance of the Mission Technology Research Council (MTRC), validating statement 4. However, statement 1 is incorrect; quantum computing utilizes both superposition and entanglement, not solely superposition. Statement 3 is also inaccurate; the NQM initially targets intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1000 qubits, not large-scale ones exceeding 1000 qubits immediately. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology/Concept   Application/Characteristic
1.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs): Produced using hybridoma technology

3.  Inverse Vaccine               : Aims to make the immune system attack healthy tissue
4.  HeLa Cells                    : Were the first human cells to be successfully cloned


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are produced using hybridoma technology, making statement 1 correct. HeLa cells were indeed the first human cells successfully cloned, validating statement 4. However, statement 2 is incorrect; phage therapy employs bacteriophages to treat bacterial, not viral, infections. Statement 3 is also false; inverse vaccines aim to make the immune system *ignore* specific molecules, not attack healthy tissue, a mechanism used to combat autoimmune diseases.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease/Condition             Related Information/Initiative
1.  Hepatitis C                    :  Egypt achieved "gold tier" status in its elimination efforts
2.  Nipah Virus (NIV)              :  Naturally hosted by fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae
3.  Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)       :  Elimination target set for 2030 under Kigali Declaration
4.  Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)      :  Primarily affects populations endemic to malaria historically


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Egypt's achievement of "gold tier" status in Hepatitis C elimination is accurately reflected in pair 1.  The association of Nipah virus with fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family is also correct in pair 2.  The historical correlation between sickle cell disease prevalence and past malaria endemicity is accurate in pair 4. However, pair 3 is incorrect; while the Kigali Declaration addresses NTDs, the specific elimination target for Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is 2027, not 2030, under India's MDA initiative.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.



**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Defence Technology/System    Characteristic/Project
1.  S-400 Air Defence System   : Developed by a US-based enterprise
2.  Project Kusha                : Aims to deploy Long-Range Surface-to-Air Missiles (LR-SAM)
3.  Dhanush Artillery Gun        :  First indigenously built short-range artillery gun
4.  Varunastra Torpedo           : Designed and developed by DRDO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Project Kusha accurately focuses on deploying LR-SAM systems, making statement 2 correct.  Varunastra's design and development by DRDO is also accurate in statement 4. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the S-400 Air Defence System was developed by a Russian, not a US-based, enterprise. Statement 3 is also false; Dhanush is a long-range, not short-range, artillery gun. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Technology Type                      Specific Example
1.  Blockchain Technology             :   Ethereum
2.  Cloud-based Software Delivery Model :  Google Drive
3.  Additive Manufacturing             :   4-D printing of self-healing materials
4.  Wireless Fidelity                  :   IEEE 802.11ac

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ethereum is a prominent example of a blockchain technology, a decentralized, distributed ledger technology used for recording and tracking transactions.  Google Drive is a clear example of a cloud-based software delivery model (SaaS), where software is developed and maintained by a provider and accessed by users. 4-D printing, which involves printing objects that change shape post-production using stimuli-responsive materials, is a type of additive manufacturing.  However, IEEE 802.11ac is a Wi-Fi standard, but it is not the most recent, Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be) being the latest.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes blockchain technology. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits additive manufacturing. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the outdated Wi-Fi standard.


**2. With reference to Cryptocurrencies, consider the following pairs:**

Cryptocurrency                     Consensus Mechanism
1. Bitcoin                             : Proof of Stake
2. Ethereum                           : Proof of Work
3.  Stablecoin                          : Proof of Authority

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bitcoin utilizes the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.  Ethereum, while initially using PoW, has transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, but the original mechanism was PoW. Stablecoins often use Proof of Authority (PoA), a mechanism where a pre-selected set of validators (authorities) verify transactions.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the consensus mechanisms used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Technology                                       Key Feature

2.  Software as a Service (SaaS)                  : Cloud-based software delivery
3.  Crypto Mining                                :  Verification of transactions
4.  3D Printing                                    : Subtractive manufacturing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

(a) 1 only
(b) 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that validates transactions through computational work (mining), not by delegating control to token owners. That's a feature of Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Stablecoins maintain a relatively stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, not necessarily to a real-world asset. Security tokens represent ownership in a real-world asset or enterprise. Utility tokens grant holders access to specific services or products.  Therefore, only the description of the Utility Token is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   3D Printing Technology Aspect     Description

4.  Materials used in 4-D printing   : Plastic, resin, thermoplastic, metal
5.  Benefits of 3D printing          : Increased inventory


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Additive manufacturing, where objects are built layer by layer, is indeed the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. 4-D printing involves materials that change shape post-production, triggered by stimuli. While extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is a cost-effective *approach*,  it's not necessarily the *most* cost-effective compared to all other methods.  The materials listed for 4-D printing are correct, but the list is not exhaustive.  3D printing leads to lower inventory, not increased inventory. Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Wi-Fi Technology Feature         Description
1. Wi-Fi 7                          :    Based on IEEE 802.11ac standard

4. Backward Compatibility           :    Increases latency
5. LiFi                              : Uses radio waves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 is based on the IEEE 802.11be standard, not 802.11ac.  Wi-Fi 7 is significantly faster than Wi-Fi 5, offering approximately four times the speed. Multi-Link Operation (MLO) allows simultaneous connections to multiple bands, enhancing performance. Backward compatibility ensures connection with older devices.  Backward compatibility reduces, not increases, latency. LiFi uses light waves, not radio waves. Therefore only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

3.  Lagrange Point L1            :   Unstable position in space
4.  Tidal Locking                 :   Causes only one side of the moon to be visible from Earth
5.  Gravity Assist Flyby          :   Maneuver used by Chandrayaan-2


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 achieved a soft landing near the lunar South Pole, not the North Pole. Aditya-L1 is a solar mission, studying the Sun, not Mars. Lagrange points L1, L2, and L3 are unstable. Tidal locking does indeed result in only one side of the moon being visible from Earth. Chandrayaan-3, not Chandrayaan-2, demonstrated a gravity assist flyby. Therefore, only the description of Tidal Locking is correctly matched.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Biotechnology Concept/Term      Description
1. Genome Editing                 :  Altering DNA of organisms using SDN
2. CRISPR/Cas9                    :   A type of genome sequencing
3. Gene Drive Technology (GDT)     :   Alters genes in a population to spread a trait
4. Biosimilar                       :   Identical to a biological medicine
5.  Stem Cells                      :   Undifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Genome editing uses site-directed nucleases to modify DNA.  CRISPR/Cas9 is a *genome editing* technology, not a sequencing technique.  Gene drive technology aims to spread a specific genetic trait within a population. A biosimilar is very similar, but not identical, to a reference biological medicine. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with self-renewal capacity. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health-related Concept/Term       Description
1.  Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) :   Caused by overuse of antibiotics
2.  Tuberculosis (TB)               :   Always curable with first-line drugs
3.  Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)        :   Caused by a mutation in haemoglobin
4.  Rare Diseases                   :   Prevalence less than 1 per 1000 population
5.  Fixed Dose Combination (FDC)   :   Always enhances efficacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Antimicrobial resistance is indeed driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Tuberculosis can be drug-resistant, making it not always curable with first-line drugs. Sickle cell disease stems from a mutation in the haemoglobin gene. Rare diseases are defined by low prevalence.  Fixed dose combinations can sometimes reduce efficacy or increase toxicity, not always enhance it. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

3. Tokamak                         :   Magnetic confinement device for fusion
4.  Molybdenum-99                  :   Parent isotope of Technetium-99m
5.  Uranium Enrichment             :   Increases percentage of U-238


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion combines light atomic nuclei, not heavy ones.  Net energy gain means the fusion process produces more energy than it consumes. A tokamak is a magnetic confinement device used in fusion research. Molybdenum-99 is the parent isotope of Technetium-99m, used in nuclear medicine. Uranium enrichment increases the percentage of U-235, not U-238. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

Similarly, the text highlights that long-read sequencing's ability to handle repetitive sequences makes it particularly useful for the complex Y-chromosome, thus validating pair 2.  Finally, the description of aerial metagenomics as "direct genetic analysis of genomes from air samples" directly confirms pair 3. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technique/Process                 Description/Feature
1. Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT) :   Involves only two people's DNA
2. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST)     :   Replaces diseased mitochondria with healthy ones
3. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)          :   Alternative to MST


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

MDT, as described, uses genetic material from parents *and* mitochondrial material from a donor, thus involving three people's DNA, making pair 1 incorrect.  The text clearly states that MST and PNT techniques aim to replace diseased mitochondria with healthy ones, which aligns with the core purpose of MDT. This makes pair 2 correct.  The text also explicitly mentions PNT as a substitute for MST, validating pair 3.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.




**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative            Focus/Objective
1. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)  :   Setting global standards for spices
2. National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) :   Regulation of organ donation
3. World Health Organization (WHO)     :   Launched PRET Initiative for pandemic preparedness

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While CAC sets food standards, its involvement in spice standardization is mentioned in the context of a specific event, not as its primary, overarching function. Therefore, pair 1 is partially correct but not fully representative of the CAC's broad role. NOTTO's function is to coordinate organ transplantation activities, but the text doesn't directly state that it *regulates* organ donation, rather it investigates irregularities, making pair 2 less certain.  The text clearly states WHO's role in launching the PRET initiative, establishing a strong connection for pair 3. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 have strong enough connections to be considered correctly matched, making (c) the most appropriate answer.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                       Characteristic/Feature

2. Chikungunya                                   :   Transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes
3. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus              :   Causes only bird flu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

LSD primarily affects cattle, not poultry, making pair 1 incorrect.  The text clearly states that Chikungunya is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, making pair 2 correct.  Avian Influenza A (H9N2) can cause both bird flu and human influenza (though rare), rendering pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, hence the answer is (b).

3. White Phosphorus                         :   Used in fertilizers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While graphene has numerous applications, its use in pencils is not explicitly stated in the text.  Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is commonly used in pencils.  Tantalum is described as having high corrosion resistance, making pair 2 correct.  White phosphorus is mentioned as a component in fertilizers, validating pair 3.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lunar Mission                     Key Finding
1. Chandrayaan-1                    :   Detection of Argon-40 in lunar exosphere
2. Chandrayaan-2                    :   Confirmation of Ocean Magma Hypothesis
3. Chandrayaan-3                    :   Detection of hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1's key findings included the detection of water in vapor form and the discovery of water ice in the Moon's North Polar region.  It also detected x-ray signals during weak solar flares and confirmed the Ocean Magma Hypothesis.  The detection of Argon-40 in the lunar exosphere is a factual finding associated with Chandrayaan-1.  Chandrayaan-2 significantly expanded on Chandrayaan-1's objectives, aiming for a soft landing and achieving further observations related to water signatures and the distribution of minor elements like chromium and manganese.  While it detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately, this was more significantly a finding of Chandrayaan-1. Chandrayaan-3 achieved a successful soft landing on the Moon's South Pole, a significant feat, but the specific detection of  hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately is primarily attributed to earlier missions. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include pairings that are factually mismatched based on the established findings of each mission.



**2. With reference to the Aditya-L1 mission, consider the following pairs:**

   Payload                                     Type
1. Visible Emission Line Coronograph (VELC) :   In-situ payload
2. Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX) : Remote sensing payload
3. Plasma Analyser Package For Aditya (PAPA) :   In-situ payload

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1 carries seven payloads, categorized as either remote sensing or in-situ payloads.  Remote sensing payloads observe the Sun from a distance, while in-situ payloads directly measure the environment around the spacecraft. VELC, SUIT, SoLEXS, and HEL1OS are all remote sensing payloads, designed to study the Sun's atmosphere and emissions.  ASPEX and PAPA are in-situ payloads, designed to study the solar wind and plasma environment near the L1 Lagrange point. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because VELC is a remote sensing payload, not an in-situ payload. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pairing. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes an incorrectly matched pair (VELC).



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a powerful gene-editing tool with applications in various fields, including plant genome editing to improve crop characteristics.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a highly sensitive technique used for radiometric dating, particularly with long-lived isotopes like Calcium-41, which extends the range of radiocarbon dating. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) uses software robots to automate repetitive tasks, and it is not directly related to the analysis of air samples.  'Aerial metagenomics' uses techniques for genetic analysis of microbial samples collected from air. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incomplete, option (c) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair (RPA), and option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrectly matched pair (RPA).



**4. With reference to the challenges of soft-landing on the Moon, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                                 Mitigation Strategy in Chandrayaan-3
1. Difficult terrain                          :   Improved thrusters (from five to four)
2. Distance from propulsion module        :   Increased landing velocity (from 2 m/sec to 3 m/sec)
3. Lunar dust obscuring camera lens         :   Larger landing site (from 500m x 500m to 4 km x 2.5 km)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 addressed the challenges of a lunar soft landing through several innovative strategies.  The difficult terrain was tackled by improvements in the landing site selection process. The distance challenge between the lander and propulsion module was addressed by increasing the landing velocity.  The issue of lunar dust obscuring the camera lens was mitigated by increasing the size of the landing zone.  While improved thrusters were a feature of Chandrayaan-3, they were not directly a mitigation strategy for the difficult terrain challenges. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the specific mitigation strategies employed by Chandrayaan-3 to overcome the listed challenges.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Graphene is known for its exceptional properties, including high surface area, good biocompatibility, strong mechanical strength, excellent thermal conductivity, and fast electron transportation.  However, its high melting point is not among its most prominent characteristics. Tantalum is a rare, grey, heavy, ductile, and very hard metal with exceptionally high corrosion resistance and a high melting point.  White phosphorus is a chemical compound used as an incendiary agent in military applications due to its spontaneous combustion in air.  It's crucial to understand the specific properties and applications of each material to correctly match them. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair based on the established properties and uses of the materials listed.


**6. With reference to the use of Non-Sugar Sweeteners (NSS), consider the following pairs:**

   NSS                                      Characteristic
1. Aspartame                             :   Derived from aceto-acetic acid
2. Acesulfame-K                          :   Methyl ester of a dipeptide
3. Sucralose                              :   Zero-calorie artificial sweetener

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that facilitates secure and transparent recording of transactions. SaaS is a cloud-based software delivery model where software is centrally hosted and accessed by users over the internet. 3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer, in contrast to subtractive manufacturing which removes material to create a shape. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair based on the established descriptions of the technologies listed.


**10. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) findings, consider the following pairs:**

   Finding                                      Implication
1. Discovery of fully formed galaxies early in the universe :   Challenges the standard model of cosmology
2. Low-mass galaxies glowing brightly          :   Star formation unfolded differently in early galaxies
3. Studying star formation in early galaxies   :  Galaxy brightness is determined solely by mass


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

JWST's observations have revealed the existence of fully formed galaxies much earlier than predicted by the standard model of cosmology, challenging its assumptions about galaxy formation. The discovery of low-mass galaxies with high brightness suggests that star formation processes in the early universe differed from those observed in present-day galaxies.  The study of star formation in early galaxies does not solely confirm that galaxy brightness is determined by mass; it rather challenges this simplistic view.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair based on the implications of JWST's findings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Technology**                                  **Associated Person/Organization**
1.  Lithium-ion battery                           :   Arthur Ashkin
2.  CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology       :   John Bannister Goodenough
3.  Optical tweezers                             :    Indian researchers
4.  World's first fourth-generation nuclear reactor :   China


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Indian researchers developed the first low-pungent mustard using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology.  John Bannister Goodenough was a co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery, and Arthur Ashkin won the Nobel Prize for his work on optical tweezers. China launched the world's first fourth-generation nuclear reactor using a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) design.  Therefore, only the pairing of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology with Indian researchers is accurately matched. The other options incorrectly link technologies to individuals or organizations not directly associated with their development or key advancements.  Arthur Ashkin's work was primarily focused on optical tweezers, not lithium-ion batteries.  While Goodenough's contributions to battery technology are significant, the question specifically asks about the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, which was developed by different scientists.  Finally, the development of the fourth-generation nuclear reactor was a national effort by China, not solely attributable to a specific individual or organization.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Energy Storage System**                       **Key Feature/Characteristic**
1.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)        :   Uses tanks of electrolyte and membrane
2.  Li-ion battery                               :   Uses solid electrolyte only
3.  Flow batteries                               :   Consists of pairs of plates immersed in electrolyte
4.  Solid-state lithium batteries                  :  High energy density


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only option (d) is correct. Solid-state lithium batteries are indeed known for their excellent potential energy density.  The other options present incorrect pairings.  Flow batteries, not BESS in general, utilize tanks of electrolyte and a membrane. Li-ion batteries can use either liquid or solid electrolytes, making option (b) partially incorrect.  Standard (non-flow) batteries, not flow batteries, consist of pairs of plates immersed in an electrolyte. The question tests understanding of the nuances of different battery technologies and their specific characteristics, requiring precise recall and differentiation.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options like liquid electrolyte usage in Li-ion batteries and the general description of BESS highlights the need for accurate factual knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Technology**                                 **Application/Characteristic**
1.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)               :   Uses pressurized water for cooling
2.  Nuclear Fusion                               :   Combines heavy atomic nuclei
3.  Gravity Battery                              :   Lifts and lowers a heavy weight for energy storage
4.  Biodegradable Paper Supercapacitor           :   Uses lithium ions as charge carriers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. A gravity battery indeed functions by lifting and lowering a heavy weight to store and release energy. The other pairings are incorrect. SMRs utilize gas (often helium), not pressurized water, for cooling. Nuclear fusion combines light, not heavy, atomic nuclei.  A biodegradable paper supercapacitor does not use lithium ions; it is a different type of energy storage device. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of different energy technologies and their operational principles. The distractors are designed to be plausible for someone with partial or superficial knowledge of these technologies. The accurate matching requires precise understanding of each technology's unique characteristics.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Space Mission**                              **Key Feature/Objective**

2.  Aditya-L1                                  :   Placed in halo orbit at Lagrange Point L2
3.  Gaganyaan Mission                          :   India's first crewed space mission
4.  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)          :   Observes the Sun


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only option (c) is correct. The Gaganyaan mission is indeed India's first crewed space mission.  The other options contain inaccuracies. Chandrayaan-3 soft-landed near the lunar South Pole, not the North Pole. Aditya-L1 is placed in halo orbit at Lagrange Point L1, not L2. The James Webb Space Telescope observes distant galaxies and celestial objects, not the Sun. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian and international space programs, requiring precise recall of mission details and objectives. The incorrect options are carefully constructed to be plausible distractors, making simple recall insufficient for a correct answer.  A deep understanding of the missions is needed to identify the inaccuracies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Organization/Initiative**                    **Primary Focus/Objective**
1.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)       :   Regulates organ transplantation
2.  National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) :   Sets international food standards
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)             :   Develops global health regulations
4.  Preparedness and Resilience For Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative :  Addresses global vision impairment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The World Health Organization (WHO) is indeed responsible for developing global health regulations and setting international health standards. The other pairings are incorrect. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) sets international food standards, NOTTO focuses on organ transplantation within a nation, and the PRET initiative addresses pandemic preparedness, not vision impairment. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different international and national organizations in the areas of health and food safety. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related organizations and their functions.  Accurate matching requires detailed knowledge of each organization's mandate.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Editing Technique           Description
1. CRISPR                           :   Uses zinc finger nucleases to modify genes
2. ZFNs                             :   A type of transcription activator-like effector nuclease
3. TALENs                          :   Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a gene editing technology that utilizes a guide RNA molecule to target specific DNA sequences, followed by the Cas9 enzyme which acts as molecular scissors to cut the DNA at the targeted location.  ZFNs (zinc finger nucleases) and TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) are other genome editing techniques, but they differ from CRISPR in their mechanism of action. ZFNs use engineered zinc finger proteins to bind to specific DNA sequences, while TALENs employ engineered transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins for the same purpose. Both ZFNs and TALENs then use a nuclease domain to cut the DNA. Therefore, only pair 3 correctly matches the gene editing technique with its description.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly link CRISPR with ZFNs and incorrectly describe ZFNs.


**2. With reference to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), consider the following pairs:**

   GMO Type                     Characteristic
1. Bt Cotton                     :   Contains genes from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
2. Bt Brinjal                    :   Approved for commercial cultivation in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton contains genes from the soil bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (*Bt*), coding for proteins toxic to bollworm insect pests.  Bt brinjal was developed but faced negative impacts and wasn't approved for commercial cultivation in India. GM Mustard (DMH-11), developed by Delhi University, indeed contains two alien genes isolated from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 2 present incorrect information regarding the source of genes in Bt cotton and the commercial cultivation status of Bt brinjal, respectively.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genome Sequencing Technique    Description
1. Short-read sequencing          :   Produces sequences easier to distinguish, handling repetitions in Y chromosome
2. Long-read sequencing           :   More effective for counting specific sequences
3. Telomere-to-Telomere sequencing:   Breaks genome into small fragments (50-300 bases)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Short-read sequencing involves breaking the genome into small fragments before sequencing, making it efficient for tasks like counting specific sequences and profiling gene expression. Long-read sequencing, on the other hand, produces longer sequences that are easier to assemble, particularly useful for complex genomes with repeated regions like the Y chromosome. Telomere-to-telomere sequencing is a type of long-read sequencing that aims to sequence the entire genome, including the telomeres. Therefore, only pair 2 accurately describes a genome sequencing technique. Pairs 1 and 3 incorrectly attribute the characteristics of long-read and short-read sequencing to each other.

2. Genome India Project (GIP)     :   Aims to collect 10,000 genetic samples from across India
3. IndiGen programme              :   Initiated by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Human Genome Project, launched in 1990 and completed in 2003, initially sequenced about 92% of the human genome. The complete 100% sequencing was achieved by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium in 2022. The Genome India Project (GIP) is an initiative of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) that aims to collect 10,000 genetic samples. The IndiGen programme was initiated by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), not the DBT. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 3 contain inaccurate information regarding the completion date of the Human Genome Project and the initiating agency of the IndiGen programme.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gene-drive technology is used for modifying genes to alter Mendelian inheritance, often applied to control populations of organisms like mosquitoes. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) involves providing replacement enzymes to patients with enzyme deficiencies, and Adzynma, approved by the USFDA, is used for treating congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP). Recombinant DNA technology enables gene transfer across species but isn't directly involved in creating synthetic human embryos (stem cells are used in that process). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 3 incorrectly link gene-drive technology with ERT and recombinant DNA technology with synthetic embryo creation.


**6. With reference to  Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Maternal spindle transfer (MST) and pronuclear transfer (PNT) are techniques used in mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT).  MST involves transferring the nuclear genetic material from the mother's egg to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, while PNT is a similar technique but performed after fertilization. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is used for various diagnostic purposes, not for replacing mitochondria.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 incorrectly associates cfDNA with mitochondrial replacement.

1. CRISPR/Cas9                       :   Uses zinc finger nucleases to modify DNA
2. ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases)     :   A type of site-directed nuclease (SDN)
3. TALENs (Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases) :  Involves genes of foreign origin in SDN3 process
4. SDN 1 & SDN 2                    :   Always involves alien genetic material

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 is a genome editing technology that uses a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific location in the genome, where it cuts the DNA.  This allows for precise edits to be made to the DNA sequence. Option 1 is incorrect because it wrongly attributes zinc finger nucleases to CRISPR/Cas9. ZFNs and TALENs are both types of site-directed nucleases (SDNs), which are proteins that can be engineered to cut DNA at specific locations. Option 2 is partially correct; ZFNs are indeed a type of SDN.  Option 3 is also partially correct as TALENs are another type of SDN. However, the statement linking TALENs to SDN3's foreign gene involvement is not universally true;  SDN3 can use TALENs but isn't exclusively defined by them. Option 4 is incorrect; SDN1 and SDN2, by definition, do *not* involve alien genetic material.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of techniques and their descriptions.  The other options contain inaccuracies or incomplete information regarding the nature of these gene editing technologies.


**2. With reference to Genetically Modified (GM) crops in India, consider the following pairs:**

2. Bt Brinjal                             :   Approved for commercial cultivation in India
3. GM Mustard (DMH-11)                 :   Result of a cross between Varuna and Early Heera-2 varieties
4. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes   :   Code for proteins toxic to pink bollworm

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton contains genes from the soil bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), which code for proteins toxic to bollworm insect pests, not *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*.  Bt brinjal was developed but not approved for commercial cultivation due to negative health and environmental concerns. GM Mustard (DMH-11) is indeed a result of a cross between Varuna and Early Heera-2 varieties, and it does contain two alien genes. Finally, Bt genes do indeed code for proteins toxic to the pink bollworm, among other pests. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the need for precise factual knowledge in this area.


**3. With reference to Genome Sequencing techniques, consider the following pairs:**

2. Long-read sequencing                         :   More effective for counting specific sequences
3. Telomere-to-telomere (T2T) sequencing   :   Sequenced 92% of the human genome in 2003
4. Human Genome Project (1990)              :   Sequenced the entire human Y-chromosome

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Short-read sequencing is *not* better at handling repetitions and loops; that's a strength of long-read sequencing. Long-read sequencing is *not* primarily used for counting specific sequences; short-read sequencing excels at this. The Human Genome Project (completed in 2003) sequenced approximately 92% of the human genome, not the entire Y-chromosome, and the T2T consortium achieved the complete human genome sequence, not just the Y-chromosome. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  This question highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of different genomic techniques and avoiding common misconceptions.


**4. With reference to the applications of Gene Drive Technology (GDT), consider the following pairs:**

   Application                                       Description

4.  CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) :   Repetitive DNA sequences used in GDT, along with a gene and Cas9 enzyme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GDT is indeed used for mosquito population control by introducing genes that increase the probability of sterile offspring, thereby reducing population numbers.  GDT modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, which is a core feature of the technology. The Cas9 enzyme is a crucial component of GDT, acting as a molecular scissor to cut and modify DNA. CRISPR is a key component of GDT, providing the mechanism for targeted gene editing, alongside a gene and the Cas9 enzyme. All four pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. This question tests the understanding of GDT's mechanism and its various applications.


**5. With reference to Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton contains genes from the soil bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), coding for proteins toxic to bollworm pests.  The Cry2Ai gene is a newer addition to some Bt cotton varieties to combat pink bollworm resistance. Bt brinjal is a different GM crop altogether, not related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens genes. GM mustard (DMH-11) contains two alien genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*, not *Bacillus thuringiensis*. Bollgard II technology, a variation of Bt technology, does not solely confer resistance to Pink Bollworm; it's a broader pest management strategy.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) Application       Specific Enzyme/Condition

Net energy gain in fusion has been achieved multiple times,  the wording in the original text is not entirely precise. Biodegradable paper supercapacitors utilize seaweed. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Millet Type                     Quality Parameter
1. Finger millet                    :   Uric acid content
2. Barnyard millet                 :   Moisture content
3. Proso millet                     :   Protein content
4. Little millet                    :   Fat content
5. Sorghum                         :   Fiber content

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) approved India's proposal for global standards on millets, including Finger millet, Barnyard millet, Kodo millet, Proso millet, and Little millet.  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) established group standards specifying eight quality parameters for fifteen types of millets.  These parameters include limits for moisture content and uric acid content.  While protein and fat content are relevant quality parameters for millets, they are not explicitly mentioned as part of the FSSAI's group standards in the provided context.  Sorghum, while having established Codex standards, is not directly linked to the specific quality parameters mentioned in the context of the FSSAI's eight-parameter standards for the five millets. Therefore, only the pairs relating to uric acid content for finger millet and moisture content for barnyard millet are definitively correct based on the provided information.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                      Specific Provision
1. Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 :   Allows sale of generic medicines even if prescription specifies brand names
2. Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 :   Regulates removal, storage, and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes
3. The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019 :   Includes Heat Not Burn Products under its definition of e-cigarettes
4. Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulation, 2018:   Imposes limits on micronutrients for fortified rice kernels
5.  Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940:   Grants licenses for drug formulations with single active ingredients in proper names only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Transplantation of Human Organs Act of 1994, as amended, indeed regulates the removal, storage, and transplantation of human organs and tissues.  The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act of 2019 explicitly includes Heat Not Burn Products within its definition of e-cigarettes. The Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulation, 2018, correctly sets limits on micronutrients in fortified rice kernels.  However, the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules of 1945, while mandating licenses for single-ingredient drug formulations, do not explicitly state that they allow the sale of generic medicines despite brand name prescriptions; that's the function of the Drugs Technical Advisory Board of India (DTAB). Similarly, while the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 is mentioned in relation to licensing, the specific detail about single active ingredient licensing is connected to the 1945 rules, not the 1940 Act itself.  Therefore, options 1 and 5 are incorrect.


**3. With reference to the National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO), consider the following pairs:**

   Function/Activity                                  Related Ministry/Organisation
1.  Facilitates coordination in organ transplantation :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  Oversees 'cash-for-kidney' investigations       :  Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)
3.  Maintains a national registry of organ donation    :   National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP)
4.  Operates under the aegis of the WHO             :   International Health Regulations (IHR) 


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

NOTTO's primary function is to facilitate coordination and networking in organ transplantation activities, falling under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The NOTP, an initiative under NOTTO, establishes and maintains a national registry of organ and tissue donation and transplantation.  However, NOTTO itself doesn't directly oversee investigations into illegal activities like 'cash-for-kidney' rackets; those would fall under the purview of law enforcement agencies and possibly the CDSCO for regulatory aspects.  Further, NOTTO's operations are not directly linked to the WHO or the IHR;  it operates within the Indian healthcare system. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                     Transmission Vector/Method
1. Chikungunya                             :   Aedes mosquitoes
2. Zika virus                               :   Blood transfusion
3. Lumpy Skin Disease                     :   Ticks
4. Nipah virus                              :   Fruit bats
5. Hepatitis C                              :  Contaminated needles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Zika virus transmission can occur through Aedes mosquitoes, blood transfusions, and sexual contact. Lumpy Skin Disease spreads through the bites of blood-feeding insects, including ticks. Nipah virus is zoonotic, with fruit bats acting as natural hosts. Hepatitis C is transmitted through contact with contaminated blood, often via contaminated needles. All the pairs accurately reflect the transmission vectors or methods for these diseases.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                         Key Feature/Application
1.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)       :   Uses sodium-sulfur batteries exclusively
2.  Lithium-ion battery                          :   Uses ether as an electrolyte
3.  Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) battery     :   Stores energy only as chemical energy
4.  Gravity battery                              :   Lifts heavy weights during charging
5.  Small Modular Reactor (SMR)                 :   Uses pressurized water for cooling


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries indeed utilize ether as an electrolyte. Gravity batteries function by lifting heavy weights during charging and lowering them during discharging. However, BESS utilize various battery types, not exclusively sodium-sulfur batteries.  ACC batteries can store energy electrochemically and chemically. SMRs utilize gas, often helium, for cooling, not pressurized water. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched based on the provided information.


**6. With reference to  Quantum Technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology                       Characteristic
1.  Quantum Computing                      :   Calculates using transistors

3.  Quantum Coherence                     :   Susceptibility to noise and disturbances
4.  Quantum Supremacy                    :   Dominance over classical computers in specific calculations
5.  National Quantum Mission (NQM)        :   Focuses on classical computing development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) does enable secure information sharing. Quantum coherence involves the maintenance of a well-defined quantum state, making it susceptible to noise and disturbances.  Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer's ability to outperform classical computers on specific tasks.  However, quantum computing utilizes qubits, not transistors, which are the basis of classical computing.  The National Quantum Mission (NQM) is focused on advancing quantum technology, not classical computing. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Web Technology Version               Key Characteristic
1. Web 1.0                               :   Enabled peer-to-peer transactions
2. Web 2.0                               :   Relies heavily on intermediaries
3. Web 3.0                               :   Includes decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
4. Web 4.0 (Symbiotic Web)               :   Interaction between humans and machines in symbiosis
5. Web 5.0                               :   Centralized data storage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Web 2.0 is indeed characterized by its reliance on intermediaries. Web 3.0 incorporates features like DAOs. Web 4.0 aims for symbiotic interaction between humans and machines.  However, Web 1.0 was primarily static and informational, not focused on peer-to-peer transactions. Web 5.0 emphasizes decentralized data storage, not centralized. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cryptocurrency Concept/Technology        Description
1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)                     :   Delegates control to token owners
2. Proof-of-Stake (PoS)                     :   Regulates block creation through mining
3.  Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)         :   Applies to all types of crypto assets
4.  DeFi                                    :   Centralized financial services model
5.  Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)            :   Fungible tokens that can be exchanged


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Proof-of-Work (PoW) regulates block creation and network integrity through mining, not delegation to token owners. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) delegates network control to token owners, not mining regulation. MiCA regulates certain categories of crypto assets, not all. DeFi is a decentralized, not centralized, financial services model. NFTs are unique, non-fungible tokens, unlike fungible cryptocurrencies.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   3D Printing Concept/Technology          Characteristic
1.  Additive Manufacturing                    :   Subtractive manufacturing process
2.  Extrusion-based metal AM                 :   Cost-effective method (relative to other metal 3D printing)
3.  4-D printing                             :   Objects retain shape after production
4.  CAD                                     :   Creates tangible 3D objects directly
5.  National Strategy for Additive Manufacturing:  Issued by the Ministry of Communications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) is indeed presented as a cost-effective method compared to other approaches in metal 3D printing.  However, additive manufacturing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. 4-D printing involves shape-changing objects post-production. CAD is a digital design tool, not a direct 3D object creation method. The National Strategy for Additive Manufacturing was released by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, not the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   AI Concept/Technology                      Description
1. Generative AI                               :   Uses only text-based inputs
2. Multimodal AI                               :   Combines multiple inputs to solve tasks
3. Deep Learning                               :   A subset of Machine Learning
4. Deepfakes                                  :   Authentic unaltered videos/images
5.  Bletchley Declaration                       :   Focuses solely on AI applications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Multimodal AI does combine multiple inputs (text, images, audio, etc.) for problem-solving. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. However, generative AI uses various input types, not solely text. Deepfakes are manipulated, not authentic, videos/images. The Bletchley Declaration addresses AI safety and risk, not just applications.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                      Associated Feature/Application

2. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)           :   Radiometric dating using Calcium-41
3. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)          :    Development of  indigenous 700 MWe Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant (KAPP 3)
4.  Hybrid Nanoparticles (gold and copper sulphide):  Use in  producing biodegradable paper supercapacitors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Indian researchers successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to create a low-pungent mustard variety.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used in a recent study to enable radiometric dating using Calcium-41, which offers advantages over traditional Carbon-14 dating due to its longer half-life. Hybrid Nanoparticles, specifically those combining gold and copper sulphide, have been utilized in a study for cancer cell treatment and detection using heat and sound waves respectively.  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a separate technology related to automation of office tasks and is not directly associated with the development of KAPP 3. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to  space exploration technologies, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission/Technology                             Characteristic/Location

2. Aditya-L1                                    :   Placement in a halo orbit around Lagrange Point L2
3. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)        :   Observation of gravitational waves at low frequencies
4.  Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) :   Use of chipsets manufactured solely in the United States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the Moon's South Pole. Aditya-L1 was placed in a halo orbit around Lagrange Point L1, not L2,  a strategically advantageous location for continuous solar observation.  The James Webb Space Telescope is not directly involved in the detection of gravitational waves at low frequencies; that discovery was made through other means.  NavIC chipsets are now being manufactured in India, contradicting option 4.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology/Concept                      Associated Fact
1.  Nuclear Fusion                               :   Uses helium as a coolant
2.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)               :   Achieved Net Energy Gain (NEG) in the US
3.  Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant (KAPP 3)      :   Uses Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) technology
4.  Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS)   :    Used to treat contaminated water at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion does not use helium as a coolant; that's a characteristic of some fourth-generation reactors.  While the US has achieved Net Energy Gain in nuclear fusion reactions, this is not directly linked to SMRs. KAPP 3 is indeed a PHWR, making this a correct pairing.  ALPS was used at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, not Chernobyl. Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to  alternative energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Technology/Concept                   Associated Detail
1. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)       :    Utilizes primarily Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) batteries
2. Li-ion Battery                               :    Co-invented by John Bannister Goodenough
3. Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs)          :   Use Cobalt and Platinum doped with Manganese as a catalyst
4.  Gravity Battery                             :   Involves lifting and lowering heavy weights to store energy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While BESS encompasses various battery types, it does not rely primarily on Sodium-Sulfur batteries.  John Bannister Goodenough was a co-inventor of the Li-ion battery. DMFCs do utilize a Cobalt and Platinum alloy doped with Manganese as a catalyst.  Gravity batteries function by lifting and lowering weights for energy storage.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Phage Therapy                                 :    Utilizes bacteriophages to treat viral infections
3. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)                :   Produced using Hybridoma technology
4. Optical Tweezers                             :    Used to study the structural details of Laponite

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Neuralink, not Apple Inc., is associated with the development of BCI. Phage therapy uses bacteriophages to treat bacterial, not viral, infections.  Monoclonal antibodies are indeed produced using hybridoma technology. Optical tweezers were used in a study to examine the structural details of Laponite. Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to diseases and health initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Disease/Concept                                 Associated Fact

2.  Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)                    :   Treated using CRISPR-based gene therapies (Casgevy and Lyfgenia)
3.  Hepatitis C                                   :   Achieved "gold tier" elimination status in Egypt
4.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                    :    Caused by a bacterial infection

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

TB is not eradicated globally; it remains a significant health concern.  CRISPR-based gene therapies, Casgevy and Lyfgenia, have been approved for treating SCD. Egypt has achieved "gold tier" status in its efforts to eliminate Hepatitis C. LSD is caused by a virus, not a bacterium. Therefore only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Agglutinates                           :   Found only on Mars
3. Chandrayaan-3 Landing Site           :   Near the lunar equator
4.  Permanently Shadowed Craters        :   Located mostly at the lunar poles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lunar regolith is a layer of unconsolidated, powdery material covering the lunar surface and is made up of rock chips, mineral fragments, impact and volcanic glasses and agglutinates.  Basalt is a component, but not the primary one. Agglutinates are unique to the Moon, not Mars. Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed near the Moon's South Pole, a region of significant scientific interest due to the presence of permanently shadowed craters. These craters are located primarily at the lunar poles, not the equator.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   ISRO Mission                     Objective
1. Chandrayaan-1                 :   Soft landing on the Moon's South Pole
2. Chandrayaan-2                 :   Detection of water ice in the lunar north pole
3. Aditya-L1                       :   Study of the Sun's chromosphere and corona
4. Gaganyaan                       :   Demonstration of human spaceflight capability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1's primary objective was to prepare a three-dimensional atlas of the Moon.  Chandrayaan-2 aimed for a soft landing, but the lander Vikram unfortunately crashed.  However, it did detect the presence of water molecules on the moon's surface, including the south pole. Aditya-L1's mission is to study the Sun's upper atmosphere, including the chromosphere and corona. Gaganyaan is indeed India's human spaceflight demonstration mission. Therefore only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Phenomenon                 Description
1. Coronal Holes                     :   Regions of intense magnetic activity in the photosphere
2. Solar Prominences                 :   Large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface
3. Solar Flares                       :   Giant explosions releasing energy and particles
4. Picoflare Jets                      :   Small jets of charged particles detected by Solar Orbiter

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Coronal holes are cooler, less dense regions in the corona, not areas of intense magnetic activity in the photosphere (that's more characteristic of sunspots). Solar prominences are indeed large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface. Solar flares are giant explosions releasing tremendous energy and charged particles.  The Solar Orbiter mission has detected picoflare jets, small but significant releases of charged particles. Thus, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Celestial Event                      Characteristic
1. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)           :   Brief bursts of gamma radiation
2. Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)           :   Most powerful explosions in the universe
3. Quasi-moon (2023 FW13)           :   Orbits the Sun independently of Earth
4. Blazar (BL Lacertae)                :   Powered by a supermassive black hole

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

FRBs are bursts of radio waves, not gamma radiation. GRBs are indeed the most powerful explosions known in the universe. The asteroid 2023 FW13 is classified as a quasi-moon, meaning its orbit around the Sun is loosely influenced by Earth's gravity but it does not orbit Earth directly. BL Lacertae is a blazar, a type of active galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology                   Application
1. Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves  :   Used in satellite communication

4.  Near-Space                         :   Region extending from 18 km to 160 km above sea level

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

EMIC waves are naturally occurring phenomena in Earth's magnetosphere, not a technology used in satellite communication.  Satellite communication systems, such as ISRO's Nabhmitra, do indeed enable two-way messaging.  FEAST is an FEA software developed by ISRO for structural analysis of various structures. Near-space is accurately defined as the region from 18 km to 160 km above sea level.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

3.  Tokamak                            :   Magnetic confinement device for fusion
4.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)   :  Uses enriched uranium as fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion combines light atomic nuclei, not heavy ones.  Net energy gain means the energy produced in a reaction exceeds the energy consumed to initiate and sustain it. A tokamak is a device that uses magnetic fields to confine plasma for nuclear fusion. PHWRs use natural uranium, not enriched uranium.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                 Property
1. Superconductor                         :   Exhibits zero resistance below a critical temperature
2. Semiconductor                          :   Conductivity lies between conductor and insulator
3. Rare Earth Elements (REEs)            :   Primarily used in low-tech applications
4. Vanadium                               :   Found abundantly as a free element in nature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance below their critical temperature. Semiconductors have conductivity between that of conductors and insulators. REEs are crucial in high-tech applications, not low-tech ones. Vanadium is rarely found as a free element; it's usually found in various minerals. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Diamond Type                          Characteristic

3.  Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)       :   Phenomenon observed in graphene at room temperature
4. Graphene                             :   Two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lab-grown diamonds are typically very pure, unlike natural diamonds which can contain various impurities. Natural diamond mining has significant environmental impacts.  Giant magnetoresistance is a phenomenon observed in various materials, including graphene, at room temperature. Graphene is accurately described as a two-dimensional layer of carbon atoms. Thus only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

4.  Nuclear Fusion                         :  Achieved net energy gain multiple times

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

BESS utilizes various battery types, including both standard and flow batteries. Lithium-ion batteries do not exhibit a significant memory effect. SMRs can utilize various coolants, but water is not typical for the advanced designs.  While net energy gain has been demonstrated in fusion experiments, it is not yet consistently achieved on a commercial scale. All options are incorrectly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Web Technology                        Characteristic

4.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)         :   Produced from a mixture of B cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Phage therapy uses bacteriophages (bacteria-infecting viruses) to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections. Macrophages are indeed a type of white blood cell involved in fighting infection. HeLa cells were the first human cells to be successfully cloned for continuous culture.  Monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single clone of B cells, not a mixture.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**13.  Consider the following pairs:**

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Naval Project                     Description
1. Project 17A (Niligiri class)           :   Follow-on class of Project 17 (Shivalik Class) Frigates, with improved stealth features
2. Project 75 (India) [P75 (I)]          :   Envisages construction of six nuclear submarines with Air Independent Propulsion System (AIP)
3. Project Sanjay                          :   Army's initiative to create a battlefield surveillance system for a composite operational picture
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project 17A is indeed the follow-on class of Project 17 (Shivalik Class) Frigates, incorporating enhanced stealth capabilities, advanced weaponry, sensors, and platform management systems.  Project Sanjay is accurately described as the Indian Army's endeavor to develop a comprehensive battlefield surveillance system, integrating numerous sensors for a unified operational picture.  However, Project 75(I) involves the construction of six *conventional* submarines, not nuclear submarines, with Air Independent Propulsion System (AIP).  The inclusion of "nuclear" in option 2 is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the project's details. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the mischaracterization of Project 75(I).


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Missile System                           Characteristic
1. Dhanush                               :   First indigenously built long-range artillery gun with a demonstrated range exceeding 40 km
2. Pralay Ballistic Missile                :   Surface-to-surface missile with a range of 1000-1500 km
3. Astra Missile                           :   Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile with a range exceeding 150 km
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dhanush is accurately described as the first indigenously built long-range artillery gun, and its demonstrated range is indeed around 38 km (though the question uses a slightly inflated figure as a distractor).  The Astra missile is correctly identified as a Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air missile with a range exceeding 150 km (though the exact range varies slightly depending on the version). However, the Pralay Ballistic Missile's range is stated incorrectly in option 2; its range is within the 150-500 km bracket, not 1000-1500 km. This incorrect range serves as a key distractor.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccurate information regarding the Pralay missile's range.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Underwater Vehicle/Torpedo             Feature

3.  Project 75 (India) submarines       :   Equipped with Air Independent Propulsion System (AIP)
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Neerakshi's endurance is four hours and its maximum depth is 300 meters, not six hours and 400 meters, making option 1 partially incorrect.  Varunastra's specifications are also slightly off in option 2; its maximum speed is 40 knots and maximum depth is 600 meters.  The correct aspect of the pairs is that Project 75(I) submarines are indeed equipped with Air Independent Propulsion System (AIP), making option 3 correct. Thus, only option (b) correctly matches one pair.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the specifications of Neerakshi and Varunastra.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                           Objective/Characteristic
1. Aditya-L1                               :   Placed in a halo orbit at Lagrange Point L2
2. Chandrayaan-3                          :   First mission to soft-land near the lunar South Pole
3. Gaganyaan                              :   Uses the LVM3 (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III) as its launch vehicle
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1 is positioned at Lagrange Point L1, not L2, making option 1 incorrect. Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the lunar South Pole, making option 2 correct.  The Gaganyaan mission utilizes the LVM3 launch vehicle, making option 3 correct.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of Aditya-L1's Lagrange point.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Technology                                    Associated Feature/Application

2.  Thermobaric Bomb                           :   Utilizes a single explosive charge to disperse fuel
3.  Hypersonic Missile                         :   Always flies at altitudes exceeding 100 km
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cluster bombs can be delivered by various methods, including aircraft, missiles, artillery, naval guns, and rocket launchers, making statement 1 incorrect.  Thermobaric bombs utilize two separate explosive charges—one to disperse fuel and another to detonate it—making statement 2 incorrect. Hypersonic missiles typically fly at much lower altitudes than 100km, making statement 3 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to  the Nobel Prize in Physics 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Awardee                                  Contribution
1. Pierre Agostini                           :   Developed the technique of producing verified attosecond pulses in a ‘train’
2. Anne L’Huillier                          :   Contributed to the generation of attosecond pulses of light using infrared laser beams and noble gas
3. Ferenc Krausz                            :   Focused primarily on electron dynamics in solids
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pierre Agostini and Ferenc Krausz are correctly paired with their contributions to generating attosecond pulses in a train. Anne L’Huillier’s work on generating attosecond pulses using infrared laser beams through noble gas is also accurately described.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Web 3.0 is characterized by its decentralized nature, enabling peer-to-peer interactions without relying on intermediaries like centralized servers or platforms. This contrasts with Web 2.0, which heavily depends on such intermediaries.  Blockchain technology's core function is to create a secure and transparent record of transactions, facilitating the tracking of interactions between users.  Each transaction is recorded as a block linked to others chronologically. This is the foundation of cryptocurrencies and other Web3 applications. Finally, SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is centrally hosted on the cloud, accessed by users through the internet and maintained by a third-party provider.  All three pairs accurately reflect the key features or applications of the respective technologies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Cryptocurrency Concept          Description
1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)          : Delegates control of the network to token owners
2. Proof-of-Stake (PoS)          : Regulates block creation through mining
3. Cryptocurrency                  : Decentralized digital money based on blockchain

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Cryptocurrencies are indeed decentralized digital currencies using blockchain technology and secured by cryptography.  This aligns perfectly with the description in pair 3. However, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched. Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain; it's fundamentally about mining, not delegating control to token owners. Conversely, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a mechanism where validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold, delegating validation power, not regulating block creation solely through mining. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Crypto Asset regulation, consider the following pairs:**

Regulatory Initiative           Key Feature/Focus
1. Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) : Applies to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
2. Indian Taxation on Crypto Assets: 30% tax on income from virtual asset transfer
3. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002: Excludes transactions involving Virtual Digital Assets

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indian government did indeed implement a 30% tax on income generated from the transfer of virtual digital assets in 2022, accurately depicted in pair 2.  However, pairs 1 and 3 are mismatched. MiCA, the European Union's crypto asset regulation, specifically excludes NFTs from its scope. Similarly, the PMLA, 2002, in India was amended in 2023 to *include* transactions involving Virtual Digital Assets under its purview for anti-money laundering purposes. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

3D Printing Technology Concept     Description
1.  Extrusion-based metal AM      : Least cost-effective method in metal 3D printing

3.  Additive Manufacturing          : A subtractive manufacturing process

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

4-D printing is correctly defined as a process that utilizes special materials to create objects capable of changing shape after production, triggered by stimuli like temperature or moisture. This makes pair 2 correct.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is *cost-effective*. Pair 3 is also incorrect because additive manufacturing is the *opposite* of subtractive manufacturing; it builds up layers of material, unlike subtractive methods which remove material to shape an object. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Wi-Fi Technology Feature          Description
1. Wi-Fi 7                             : Four times slower than Wi-Fi 6

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. E-cigarettes are *not* licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940; in fact, they are banned in India. Sickle cell disease is characterized by *abnormally shaped*, crescent-shaped red blood cells, not smooth, doughnut-shaped ones. While CRISPR-based gene therapies show promise, the provided text only mentions their approval for sickle cell disease, not all types of cancer.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  Quantum Technology, consider the following pairs:**

Concept/Initiative                Description/Feature
1. National Quantum Mission (NQM) : Aims to develop quantum computers with a processing capacity of up to 10 qubits

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Quantum computing is accurately described as utilizing quantum mechanical principles like superposition and entanglement for computation. This makes pair 2 correct. However, pair 1 is incorrect; the NQM aims to develop quantum computers with a much wider processing capacity range (50-1000 qubits), not just up to 10 qubits.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; quantum coherence describes the *ability* of a quantum system to maintain a well-defined quantum state, not its inability. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Genetic Technology/Concept      Description
1. Gene Editing                     : Involves only transgenes for improvement
2. Genome Sequencing               : Determines the order of DNA nucleotides in a genome
3. Mitochondrial Donation Treatment: Involves genetic material from four people

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Genome sequencing is correctly described as the process of determining the order of DNA bases in a genome. This makes pair 2 correct.  Pair 1 is incorrect; gene editing modifies existing genetic material, not solely using transgenes (foreign genes), which is a characteristic of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  Pair 3 is also incorrect; mitochondrial donation treatment involves genetic material from three people (parents and a mitochondrial donor), not four.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Organization                     Initiative
1. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers     :    National Health Mission (NHM)
2. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare   :    Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)
3. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers     :    Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
4.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) : Saksham Anganwadi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only

(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair mentioning the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme is correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) is an initiative of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, not the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The National Health Mission (NHM)'s Free Drugs Service Initiative is a separate program under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.  Saksham Anganwadi is associated with the distribution of fortified rice, a program under the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatches in the ministries and their respective initiatives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Drug/Vaccine                          Related Organization/Initiative
1. Trastuzumab (biosimilar)               :    National Ayush Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMSTE) portal
2.  Cervavac vaccine                      :    Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)
3.  GEMCOVAC-OM (mRNA vaccine)          :    Serum Institute of India
4. ZyCoV-D (DNA vaccine)                :    Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pair linking Cervavac vaccine to Serum Institute of India is correct.  Trastuzumab biosimilar received marketing authorization from CDSCO, not NAMSTE portal which is related to traditional medicine terminologies. GEMCOVAC-OM is an Indian mRNA vaccine developed indigenously, not by Serum Institute of India, which developed Cervavac. ZyCoV-D is a DNA vaccine, unrelated to FSSAI, which deals with food safety and standards. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.

3.  Nipah Virus                             :   Affects the liver
4. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus        :   Causes reduced milk yield in cattle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus with its characteristic of causing bird flu (and rarely human influenza) is correct. Lumpy Skin Disease is transmitted by vectors like insects, not contaminated food. Hepatitis C primarily affects the liver, not transmitted by insects; it's often spread through contaminated needles. Nipah Virus is a zoonotic disease, transmitted from animals to humans, often through contaminated food, not directly affecting the liver primarily. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mismatched characteristics or transmission methods.

3.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)        : Artificial antibodies mimicking immune system activity
4.  Optical Tweezers                     :   Used in the treatment of cancers, Ebola, HIV etc.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) with their description as artificial antibodies mimicking immune system activity is correct. Quantum Coherence refers to a quantum system's ability to maintain a defined state; it's not a type of neural network. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, not directly related to quantum systems' ability to maintain a state. Optical tweezers are used to manipulate microscopic objects, not primarily for treating diseases.  Thus, options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 is a genome editing technology that utilizes a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where it creates a double-stranded break. This break is then repaired by the cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms, which can introduce mutations or insertions.  Option (a) is incorrect because CRISPR/Cas9 does not use ZFNs; it uses a guide RNA and Cas9 enzyme. ZFNs are a distinct genome editing technique. Option (b) is partially correct as ZFNs are indeed a type of site-directed nuclease, but the description of TALENs is incomplete and misleading.  While SDN 1 and 2 do not use alien genetic material, TALENs are also a separate technique, not directly related to this distinction. Option (d) is incorrect; SDN 3 *does* involve alien genetic material, unlike SDN 1 and 2.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the characteristics of ZFNs as a type of SDN.  The statement about SDN 3 is a crucial differentiator between gene editing and genetic modification.

Net energy gain (NEG) means that the energy produced exceeds the energy consumed in a process. A tokamak is a doughnut-shaped device used in experimental fusion reactors to confine plasma. Only the pairing of Tokamak with its description is correct. The other pairings incorrectly define nuclear fusion and net energy gain. This highlights the importance of understanding the concepts and terminology related to nuclear technology.

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect characteristics or transmission vectors of the respective diseases. Chikungunya is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Zika virus can spread through sexual contact in addition to mosquito bites. Lumpy skin disease is transmitted by blood-feeding insects, including ticks. Hepatitis C can be transmitted via contaminated needles and other medical equipment. Nipah virus has fruit bats as its natural reservoir.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading information in the pairs. Therefore, the correct answer is (c).



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Drug/Therapy                     Description/Application
1. Biosimilar trastuzumab          :   A drug for treating rare diseases

3. CAR-T cell therapy              : A medicine closely resembling a biological medicine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biosimilar trastuzumab is a biosimilar, a type of medicine that is very close in structure and function to a biological medicine.  Option (a) is incorrect because it is not used for rare diseases; it's a cancer drug.  Option (b) is incorrect because ERT involves replacing deficient enzymes, not using genetically modified T cells. That's the function of CAR-T cell therapy, making option (c) correct. CAR-T cell therapy uses genetically modified T cells to target and destroy cancer cells. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Food Fortification Element        Function/Description
1. Iron                               : Prevents cretinism and goiter

3. Folic Acid (Vitamin B9)           :  A component of fortified rice kernels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Iron is a micronutrient added to fortified rice to combat malnutrition and anemia; however, it doesn't directly prevent cretinism and goiter (those are related to iodine deficiency).  Vitamin B12 is found in some dairy products, but that's a natural occurrence, not its primary function in food fortification. Folic acid is indeed a component of fortified rice kernels. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

3. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) : A type of Site-Directed Mutagenesis (SDM)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR is a gene editing technique using Cas9 enzyme and guide RNA, not zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs). SDN 1 is a type of site-directed mutagenesis that does *not* involve foreign genetic material. TALENs are indeed a type of site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Optical Tweezers                     :   Used to study the structural details of Laponite
2. HeLa cells                             :   First human cells to be successfully cloned
3.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)      :   Produced through a process involving extracting antibodies from animal blood

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Optical tweezers are indeed used to manipulate microscopic objects, including the study of materials like Laponite. HeLa cells were the first human cells successfully cloned. However, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are produced by cloning specific antibody-producing cells, not by extracting antibodies from animal blood.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare    :   Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
3. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers     :   Free Drugs Service Initiative of National Health Mission
4. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India :  Distribution of fortified rice under Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched in 2008 by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers to promote generic medicines.  This makes pair 1 correct. The Free Drugs Service Initiative is a program under the National Health Mission (NHM), which falls under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme is also under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, aiming to boost domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect, as the Free Drugs Service Initiative is not under the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.  Pair 2 is also incorrect because the PLI scheme is not under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The distribution of fortified rice under Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 is a key initiative of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), making pair 4 correct.  Hence, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Body                         Classification/Function
1.  WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) :  Covers only traditional medicine conditions originating in ancient China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WHO's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) includes Module 2 dedicated to Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani, not solely to traditional Chinese medicine. Thus, statement 1 is incorrect. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) indeed operationalized provisions for micronutrient limits in fortified rice kernels, making statement 2 correct. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) sets voluntary, not mandatory, global food standards, including those for millets and some spices.  Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect. NOTTO operates under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not Defence, making statement 4 incorrect. Consequently, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Technology/Concept                     Description/Characteristic
1.  Biosimilar                               :  A medicine identical in structure and function to a biological medicine
2.  Biofortification                          :  Post-harvest method of increasing micronutrient content in food
3.  3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing      :  A subtractive manufacturing process
4.  Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) :  Indoor optical wireless communication technology

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A biosimilar is a medicine very close, but not necessarily identical, in structure and function to a biological medicine.  While similar, the wording in the provided text makes the given statement about biosimilars correct enough for the purpose of this question. Biofortification is a process of breeding nutrients into food crops, not a post-harvest method; fortification is the post-harvest method.  3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) is an outdoor, not indoor, technology.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are partially or completely correct, depending on the interpretation of the word "identical" in pair 1.  Considering the context of the question and the other options, (d) is the most suitable answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Net Energy Gain (NEG)                     :  Fusion process consumes more energy than it generates
3.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses enriched uranium as fuel
4. Molybdenum-99 production                :  Yields technetium-99m, used in radiation therapy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion combines light atomic nuclei, not heavy ones, releasing massive amounts of energy.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Net Energy Gain (NEG) means the fusion process generates more energy than it consumes, making statement 2 incorrect. PHWRs use natural uranium, not enriched uranium, as fuel. Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect. Molybdenum-99 production does yield technetium-99m, which is useful in nuclear medicine procedures, not radiation therapy.  While the description is not fully accurate, it is close enough to be considered correct in the context of the other pairs.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                                    Characteristic/Transmission
1. Chikungunya                              : Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes
2. Lumpy Skin Disease                       : Affects only cattle, not other animals
3. Hepatitis C                               :  Has an effective vaccine for prevention
4. Nipah Virus                               : Primarily transmitted through direct human-to-human contact


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is transmitted by Aedes, not Anopheles, mosquitoes. Lumpy Skin Disease can affect other animals besides cattle.  Hepatitis C does not have an effective vaccine; only Hepatitis A and B have vaccines. Nipah virus can be transmitted through various means, including contaminated food and animals, not solely through direct human-to-human contact.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Technology/Initiative                      Description/Feature
1.  ASTR (AI-based facial recognition tool)  :  Used for blocking stolen/lost mobile phones

1. Generic Drugs                             : Cannot be marketed until after the branded drug's patent expires
2. Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Drugs       : Always increase efficacy and reduce toxicity
3. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)             : Are a mixture of antibodies from different B cell lineages
4. Inverse Vaccine                            :  Works by making the immune system attack a specific molecule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While compulsory licensing can allow for earlier marketing of generic drugs under certain circumstances, the basic principle is that they are marketed after patent expiry. FDCs can have both increased efficacy and enhanced toxicity, depending on the specific combination. mAbs are clones of a single antibody, not a mixture. Inverse vaccines work by making the immune system *ignore*, not attack, a specific molecule.  Therefore, only pair 1 is (partially) correct.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Computer Technology/Concept             Description/Application
1.  Supercomputers                          :  Performance measured in MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)
2.  Crypto Mining                            :  Exclusively uses CPUs for processing
3.  Blockchain Technology                     :  Centralized ledger technology
4.  Net Neutrality                           :  Allows ISPs to prioritize certain types of internet traffic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Supercomputer performance is measured in FLOPS (Floating-point Operations Per Second), not MIPS. Crypto mining uses various methods beyond CPUs, including GPUs and ASICs. Blockchain technology is decentralized, not centralized. Net neutrality prohibits ISPs from prioritizing traffic. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion combines light atomic nuclei, not heavy ones. KAPP 3 uses natural uranium as fuel, not enriched uranium. Molybdenum-99 is indeed the parent isotope of Technetium-99m, a crucial isotope in nuclear medicine. ALPS was used in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident, not Chernobyl.  Therefore, only the pairing for Molybdenum-99 is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in the descriptions of nuclear fusion, KAPP 3, and ALPS.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Sickle cell disease is indeed caused by an abnormal hemoglobin gene, specifically the beta-globin gene. Biosimilars are very similar but not identical to the original biological medicine. Fixed-dose combination drugs can improve efficacy but may not always reduce side effects. Generic drugs can be marketed under compulsory licensing even before patent expiration.  Only the description of Sickle Cell Disease is entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in the descriptions of biosimilars, fixed-dose combination drugs, and generic drugs.

4.  Radiometric Dating using Calcium-41       :   Suitable for dating objects older than 50,000 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Supercritical carbon dioxide is indeed used in enhanced oil recovery. Tantalum has a very high melting point, not a low one. Hyperloop is a proposed ultra-high-speed ground transportation system, not underwater.  Calcium-41, with a longer half-life than Carbon-14, extends the range of radiometric dating to objects older than 50,000 years. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the descriptions of tantalum and hyperloop.





**1. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following pairs:**

1. CRISPR/Cas9                              :   Development of low-pungent mustard variety
2. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)           :   Modification of existing genetic material in Bt cotton
3. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) :  Creation of synthetic human embryo-like structures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used in the development of a low-pungent mustard variety, as explicitly stated in the provided text.  This technique is a precise method for genome editing, allowing for targeted modifications to DNA sequences.  The other options are incorrect. While ZFNs and TALENs are also genome editing techniques, there's no direct mention of their use in the development of low-pungent mustard or synthetic human embryos in the provided text.  Bt cotton is a genetically modified organism (GMO), involving the insertion of foreign genes, not simply the modification of existing genetic material using techniques like ZFNs or TALENs.  The creation of synthetic human embryos utilizes stem cells, a different biological approach than ZFNs or TALENs.  Therefore, only pair 1 accurately reflects the information given.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of specific genome editing techniques and their applications.


**2. With reference to Artificial Intelligence (AI), consider the following pairs:**

   AI Type                                    Example

2. Multimodal AI                             :  OpenAI’s ChatGPT
3. Frontier AI                               :   Google’s Bard

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Krutrim is explicitly identified in the text as an example of a generative AI model. Generative AI models are designed to create new content, such as text, images, or audio.  The other pairs are incorrect.  While ChatGPT and Bard are indeed powerful AI models, they are not exclusively examples of multimodal or frontier AI.  ChatGPT primarily operates with text, although it might have some multimodal capabilities, it's not its primary defining feature. Similarly, Bard, while highly advanced, doesn't neatly fall under the specific definition of "Frontier AI" as described in the text (Frontier AI models are characterized by exceeding the capabilities of most advanced models, a subjective and constantly evolving criterion). The question tests factual recall and understanding of AI categories and their examples.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Description

3.  Blockchain Technology        :   Centralized digital ledger

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Wi-Fi 7 is based on the IEEE 802.11be standard, not 802.11ac. 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger, not centralized.  All three pairs contain incorrect information. The question tests factual recall and understanding of these technologies.  The incorrect options serve as strong distractors, as they represent common misunderstandings or related but inaccurate information.


**4. With reference to Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                            Characteristic
1. Lead-Acid (PbA) battery                 :   Highest energy density among the listed types
2. Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery            :   5000+ charge-discharge cycles
3. Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery           :   Uses a solid electrolyte

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text states that Lithium-ion batteries have 5000 or more charge-discharge cycles, and that Lead-Acid batteries are a type included in standard BESS.  However, the statement that Lead-Acid batteries have the highest energy density is incorrect; Lithium-ion batteries typically possess higher energy density. The statement about Sodium-Sulfur batteries using a solid electrolyte is also false; they use a liquid electrolyte. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are partially correct (pair 2 is entirely correct, while pair 1 is partially correct due to the incorrect claim about energy density).  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements about different battery types.

2. Fourth-generation nuclear reactor      :   Uses helium for cooling
3. Conventional nuclear power reactor     :   Modular design

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that fourth-generation nuclear reactors use helium for cooling, distinguishing them from conventional reactors that use pressurized water.  The other options are incorrect.  Small modular reactors (SMRs) are described as having a compact design and modular components, but the text doesn't specify their cooling method as pressurized water.  Conventional nuclear power reactors are not known for modular design; their design is typically large and complex, not easily broken down into modules for transport and assembly.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of different nuclear reactor types and their characteristics.

2. Zika virus                                 :   Primarily through sexual contact
3. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                   :   Blood-feeding insects
4. Hepatitis C                               :   Reuse of inadequately sterilized medical equipment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is correctly matched to its transmission by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Lumpy Skin Disease is also correctly linked to its transmission via blood-feeding insects.  Hepatitis C is accurately paired with its transmission through the reuse of inadequately sterilized medical equipment.  However, the Zika virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, not primarily through sexual contact, although it can be transmitted sexually. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between primary and secondary transmission routes of various diseases.

2. Ixchiq                                   :   Chikungunya
3. Inactivated low pathogenic avian influenza (H9N2) vaccine :   Cervical cancer

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Ixchiq is correctly identified as the world's first approved vaccine for chikungunya. The other pairings are incorrect. Cervavac is a vaccine for cervical cancer, not influenza. The inactivated low pathogenic avian influenza (H9N2) vaccine is for chickens, protecting them from avian influenza, not humans or cervical cancer. This question tests factual recall of specific vaccines and the diseases they prevent.  The incorrect pairings are designed to be plausible distractors, testing the examinee's knowledge of vaccine types and their applications.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FRKs are correctly identified as Fortified Rice Kernels.  Ultra-processed foods are accurately described as being rich in added sugars and hydrogenated fats.  However, biofortification is a pre-harvest method of breeding nutrients into food crops, not a post-harvest method of adding micronutrients. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question tests the examinee's understanding of terminology related to food fortification and its various aspects. The incorrect pairing of biofortification acts as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the term's definition.

Cryptocurrency Concept     Description
1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)      : Delegates network control to token owners
2. Proof-of-Stake (PoS)      : Regulates block creation in Bitcoin
3. Stablecoin                 : Value pegged to a real-world asset

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.  It does *not* delegate network control to token owners; that is a characteristic of Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism that selects validators based on the number of tokens they hold, thus delegating network control to token owners. It is *not* the mechanism that regulates block creation in Bitcoin; that is PoW.  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity like gold.  Therefore, only the statement about Stablecoins is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Crypto Assets, consider the following pairs:**

Token Type                  Description
1. Utility Token              : Represents ownership in a real-world asset
2. Security Token             : Provides access to a product or service
3. Asset-Referenced Token : Value fixed, often pegged to a currency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Utility tokens grant holders access to a product or service offered by a project or company.  They do *not* represent ownership in a real-world asset; that's the function of security tokens. Security tokens represent ownership stakes in real-world assets or enterprises, offering investors a claim on the underlying asset or company's profits. They do *not* provide access to a product or service; that is the function of utility tokens.  Asset-referenced tokens, such as stablecoins, maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency or commodity.  Therefore, only the description of Asset-Referenced Tokens is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

3D Printing Technology Feature     Description

3. Additive Manufacturing           : Subtractive manufacturing process

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively cost-effective method compared to other metal 3D printing approaches, making statement 1 incorrect.  4D printing involves the use of materials that change shape or properties in response to external stimuli after the initial 3D printing process, making statement 2 correct. Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process of building up objects layer by layer, as opposed to subtractive manufacturing which removes material to create the desired shape; making statement 3 incorrect.

4. National Organ Transplant Programme (2021-26) :   Allowed organ transplantation for those above 65
5. NOTTO                                          : Operates under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, allowed organ donation from both live and brain-stem dead donors, not just brain-stem dead donors as stated in pair 1.  The Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act, 2011, did *not* remove the domicile requirement for organ recipients; that was a feature of the modified guidelines.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014, did *not* establish a national registry; that is a function of the National Organ Transplant Programme. Pair 4 is correct: The modified National Organ Transplantation Guidelines under the NOTTO program did, in fact, allow those above 65 years of age to receive organs and removed the domicile requirement.  NOTTO operates under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.

3. Transition Region                    : 8000 K - 500,000 K
4. Corona                              : 500,000 K or more

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct matching is only for the Transition Region (3).  The temperature in the transition region rises abruptly from about 8000 K to about 500,000 K.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the temperature ranges of the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. The photosphere's temperature varies between about 6500 K at the bottom and 4000 K at the top.  The chromosphere's temperature ranges from approximately 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top. The corona's temperature is significantly higher, reaching 500,000 K or more.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect temperature ranges for at least one of the solar atmospheric layers.


**2. With reference to the Sun's features, consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Feature                        Description
1. Sunspots                             : Areas of open, unipolar magnetic fields
2. Coronal Holes                        : Extremely strong magnetic fields
3. Solar Prominences                    : Large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface
4. Solar Flares                          : Giant explosions associated with CMEs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Solar prominences are indeed large, bright features extending outward from the Sun's surface.  The other pairs are incorrect. Sunspots are areas where the Sun's magnetic field is extremely strong and the magnetic lines are twisted, not regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields (pair 1). Coronal holes are cooler, less dense regions than the surrounding plasma and are regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields, not areas of extremely strong magnetic fields (pair 2). Solar flares are giant explosions on the sun that send energy, light, and high-speed particles into space and are often associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), but the description in pair 4 doesn't accurately capture the entirety of their characteristics.


**3. With reference to the Gaganyaan mission, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                  Description

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Gaganyaan's first Flight Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TV-D1) successfully simulated the abort condition during the ascent trajectory. The other pairs are incorrect. The Launch Vehicle is the LVM3 (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III), not a single-stage liquid rocket (pair 1). While the human-rated L110-G VIKAS engine has been successfully tested, it's a liquid-fuelled rocket engine, not a cryogenic engine (pair 3). The ECLSS was indigenously developed by ISRO, not a private company (pair 4).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. Chandrayaan-1 detected water in vapor form and water ice in the North polar region. Chandrayaan-2 detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately and contributed to confirming the Ocean Magma Hypothesis. Chandrayaan-3 successfully soft-landed near the lunar South Pole.  NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission successfully collected samples from the carbon-rich asteroid Bennu. Therefore, all the missions are accurately paired with their key findings.


**6. With reference to Aditya-L1, consider the following pairs:**

1. Visible Emission Line Coronograph (VELC) : In-situ payload
2. Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) : Remote sensing payload
3. Plasma Analyser Package For Aditya (PAPA) : In-situ payload
4. High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS) : Remote sensing payload

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. SUIT, PAPA, and HEL1OS are all remote sensing payloads on Aditya-L1. VELC is also a remote sensing payload, not an in-situ payload as stated in pair 1. In-situ payloads directly measure the environment around the spacecraft, while remote sensing payloads observe the sun from a distance.  Therefore, only options with pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correct.


**7. With reference to Gravitational Waves, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Source
1. Higher-frequency Gravitational Waves : Huge black holes
2. Lower-frequency Gravitational Waves  : Smaller pairs of black holes
3. First Detection                         : Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Gravitational waves were first detected in 2015 using LIGO detectors. The other pairs are incorrect. Higher-frequency gravitational waves originate from smaller pairs of black holes, not huge black holes (pair 1). Conversely, lower-frequency gravitational waves are thought to be generated by merging supermassive black holes, not smaller pairs of black holes (pair 2).


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                    Transmission Mode
1. Lumpy Skin Disease                       : Blood-feeding insects
2. Nipah Virus                               : Contaminated food or direct human-to-human contact
3. Hepatitis C                               : Reuse of inadequately sterilized medical equipment
4. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus          : Exposure to infected poultry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Lumpy Skin Disease is transmitted by blood-feeding insects. Nipah virus can spread through contaminated food or direct human-to-human transmission. Hepatitis C is often transmitted through the reuse of inadequately sterilized medical equipment, especially syringes. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) can be transmitted through exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.  Therefore, all transmission modes are accurately paired with their respective diseases.


**9. With reference to  Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                            Characteristic
1. Lead-Acid (PbA) battery                : High energy density
2. Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery           : Low self-discharge rate
3. Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery           :  Solid-state electrolyte
4. Redox Flow Battery (RFB)              : Uses tanks of electrolyte


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Lithium-ion batteries are known for their low self-discharge rate. Redox flow batteries utilize tanks of electrolyte. The other pairs are incorrect. Lead-acid batteries do not have high energy density compared to other types like lithium-ion. Sodium-sulfur batteries do not use a solid-state electrolyte.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correct matches.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                   Description
1.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)                 : Achieved in nuclear fusion reaction
2. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)          : Use pressurized water for cooling
3.  Biofortification                        : Post-harvest method of nutrient addition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Net energy gain in nuclear fusion reactions refers to the point where more energy is produced than is used to initiate the reaction. The other pairs are incorrect. Small modular reactors typically do not use pressurized water for cooling;  they often utilize different coolants like helium or liquid metal. Biofortification is a method of breeding nutrients into food crops, not a post-harvest method like fortification. Therefore, only option (a) is accurate.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   ISRO Mission                     Primary Objective
1. Chandrayaan-1                 : Soft landing on the Moon
2. Chandrayaan-2                 :  Prepare a three-dimensional atlas of the Moon
3. Aditya-L1                       : Study Jupiter and its icy moons
4. Gaganyaan                      : Demonstrate human spaceflight capability

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1's primary objective was to prepare a three-dimensional atlas of both the near and far sides of the Moon.  Chandrayaan-2 aimed to widen the scientific objectives of Chandrayaan-1 by attempting a soft landing on the Moon, although the lander unfortunately crashed. Aditya-L1 is a solar mission, not a mission to Jupiter and its moons (that would be JUICE).  The Gaganyaan mission is indeed focused on demonstrating India's human spaceflight capabilities. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the components of Lunar Regolith, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                         Description
1. Rock chips                         :  A peculiar component found only on the Moon
2. Mineral fragments                 : Formed by high-energy electrons from Earth
3. Impact glasses                    :  Volcanic glasses
4. Agglutinates                      :  Rock chips, mineral fragments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Rock chips and mineral fragments are indeed components of lunar regolith. Impact glasses are a type of glass formed by meteorite impacts on the lunar surface.  Agglutinates are a unique type of lunar soil particle formed by the welding together of smaller particles by impact melting.  The statement that mineral fragments are formed by high-energy electrons from Earth is incorrect; while electrons can contribute to surface changes, this is not the primary formation process of mineral fragments.  The description of rock chips as a peculiar component found only on the Moon is also inaccurate; while their specific composition may vary, rock chips are a common component in regolith. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Celestial Body                     Feature
1. Moon                               :  Possesses a significant atmosphere
2. Sun                                 :  Its photosphere temperature varies between 4000 K and 8000 K
3. Jupiter                             :  Has the highest number of moons in the solar system
4. Earth                              : Experiences tidal locking with the Moon


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Moon does not have a significant atmosphere; it has an extremely thin exosphere. The photosphere of the Sun has a temperature range of approximately 4000 K to 6500 K, not 8000 K. Saturn has a higher number of moons than Jupiter.  The Earth does experience tidal locking with the Moon, meaning that the Moon's rotation is synchronized with its orbital period around the Earth. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Chandrayaan-3 mission, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                                   Significance
1. Shiv Shakti Point                      : Crash landing site of Chandrayaan-2
2. Tiranga Point                           : Soft landing site of Chandrayaan-3
3. Lunar South Pole                       : Easier and safer landing area compared to the equator
4. Lunar Equator                          :  Contains permanently shadowed craters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Shiv Shakti Point is the soft landing site of Chandrayaan-3, while Tiranga Point marks the crash landing site of Chandrayaan-2. The lunar South Pole is considered more challenging for landing than the equator due to its rugged terrain and permanently shadowed regions.  The lunar equator is characterized by abundant sunlight and relatively smoother terrain, making it easier for landings.  Permanently shadowed craters, which are of scientific interest for potential water ice, are found at the lunar poles, not the equator.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space-based Observatory           Location/Feature
1. Hubble Space Telescope            : Placed near Lagrange Point L1
2. James Webb Space Telescope       : Placed near Lagrange Point L2
3. Aditya-L1                         :  Successor to Hubble Space Telescope
4. Solar and Heliospheric Observatory : Joint project of NASA, ESA, and CSA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Hubble Space Telescope is not located near Lagrange Point L1; it's in low Earth orbit. The James Webb Space Telescope is indeed located near Lagrange Point L2. Aditya-L1 is not the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope; they serve different scientific purposes. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is a joint project of NASA and ESA, not NASA, ESA, and CSA (that's JWST). Therefore, only pairs 2 is correctly matched.


**6. With reference to types of  Batteries, consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                          Characteristic
1. Lead-Acid Battery                   : Uses a solid electrolyte
2. Lithium-ion Battery                 :  Higher cycle life than Lead-Acid
3. Sodium-ion Battery                  :  Lower cost than Lithium-ion
4. Redox Flow Battery                  : Uses tanks of electrolyte


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lead-acid batteries use a liquid electrolyte, not a solid one. Lithium-ion batteries do have a significantly higher cycle life (number of charge-discharge cycles) than lead-acid batteries. Sodium-ion batteries are indeed generally less expensive than lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. Redox flow batteries utilize tanks of electrolyte to store energy. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                             Description/Application
1.  Optical Tweezers                    : Used in studying the structure of Laponite
2.  3D Printing                           :  A subtractive manufacturing process
3.  Hyperloop                             : Ultra-high-speed ground transportation
4.  Facial Recognition Technology       :  Developed by the Ministry of Communications under Sanchar Saathi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Optical tweezers are a technology used to manipulate microscopic objects, and have been applied in studying the structure of materials like Laponite. 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, not subtractive. Hyperloop is indeed a proposed high-speed ground transportation system. The Sanchar Saathi initiative uses Aadhaar-based authentication, not necessarily facial recognition technology. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  Nuclear Reactors, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type                          Feature
1. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)        : Uses pressurized water for cooling
2. Fourth-generation nuclear reactor : Uses gas for cooling
3. Conventional Nuclear Power Plant :  Modular design
4. SMR                               :  Physically larger than conventional reactors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) typically use different cooling methods, often not pressurized water. Fourth-generation nuclear reactors are characterized by their use of gas (like helium) for cooling. Conventional nuclear power plants generally don't have a modular design; SMRs are specifically designed for modularity. SMRs are smaller than conventional nuclear reactors. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Wave                           Characteristic
1.  Gravitational Waves                 : Predicted by Newton's Laws of Motion
2. Electromagnetic Waves              : Travel at the speed of light
3.  EMIC Waves                          : Observed in Earth's inner magnetosphere
4. Radio Waves                          :  Not part of the electromagnetic spectrum


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, not Newton's Laws. Electromagnetic waves, which include radio waves, do travel at the speed of light. EMIC waves are indeed observed in Earth's inner magnetosphere. Radio waves are a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to  Types of Sweeteners, consider the following pairs:**

   Sweetener Type                       Property
1. Aspartame                           :  Natural sweetener extracted from a fruit
2. Sucralose                            : Zero-calorie artificial sweetener
3. Steviol Glycosides                   : Methyl ester of a dipeptide
4. Thaumatin                           :  Derived from aceto-acetic acid



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aspartame is an artificial sweetener, not a natural one extracted from a fruit (Monk fruit is a natural sweetener). Sucralose is indeed a zero-calorie artificial sweetener. Steviol glycosides are natural sweeteners extracted from Stevia plants, not a methyl ester of a dipeptide (that's Aspartame). Thaumatin is derived from the fruit of Thaumatococcus danielli, not aceto-acetic acid (that might be related to Acesulfame-K). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Function/Characteristic
1.  World Health Organization (WHO)         :   Solely responsible for establishing CAC headquarters
2.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) :   Jointly established CAC with WHO
3.  Codex Alimentarius                     :   A collection of mandatory food standards
4.  CCSCH (Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs) :   Finalizes spice quality standards for Codex Alimentarius adoption.
5.  FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India)   :   Sets quality parameters for Indian millets only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), making option 2 correct.  The Codex Alimentarius itself is a collection of voluntary, not mandatory, standards, guidelines, and codes of practice, making option 3 incorrect. The CCSCH plays a crucial role in finalizing spice quality standards, which are then recommended for adoption as full-fledged Codex standards by the CAC, validating option 4.  FSSAI's role is limited to setting quality parameters for Indian millets, a subset of the broader work done by the CAC, making option 5 correct.  Option 1 is incorrect because the CAC headquarters is jointly managed, not solely by WHO.  Therefore, only options 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Organ and Tissue Transplantation, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Organization                          Provision/Function
1.  NOTTO (National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation) :   Operates under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs
2.  Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 :   Allowed organ donation only from brain-dead donors
3.  Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act (THOTA) 2011 :   Specifically prohibits xenotransplantation
4.  National Organ Transplant Programme (2021-2026) :   Maintains a national registry of organ donation and transplantation
5.  Modified National Organ Transplantation Guidelines :   Retained the domicile requirement for organ recipients

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) operates under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, making option 1 incorrect. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 allowed organ donation from both live and brain-stem dead donors, contradicting option 2.  THOTA 2011 does not specifically prohibit xenotransplantation; it regulates it, making option 3 incorrect. The National Organ Transplant Programme does indeed maintain a national registry, making option 4 correct.  The Modified National Organ Transplantation Guidelines removed, not retained, the domicile requirement, making option 5 incorrect.  Consequently, only option 4 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to e-cigarettes, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                           Provision/Characteristic
1.  Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Act, 2019 (PECA) :   Allows the sale of nicotine-containing products licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
2.  Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940            :   Provides a licensing framework for e-cigarettes containing nicotine
3.  Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) :   Specifically excluded from the definition of e-cigarettes in PECA
4.  Heat Not Burn Products                   :   Included in the definition of e-cigarettes in PECA
5.  E-Hookah                                  :   Excluded from the definition of e-cigarettes in PECA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PECA Act explicitly bans e-cigarettes, including those containing nicotine, and does not allow the sale of such products even if licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, making option 1 incorrect.  The Drugs and Cosmetics Act does not provide a licensing framework for e-cigarettes; it regulates other pharmaceutical products, making option 2 incorrect. ENDS are explicitly included in the definition of e-cigarettes under PECA, making option 3 incorrect. Heat Not Burn Products are indeed included in PECA's definition of e-cigarettes, making option 4 correct. E-Hookah is also included, making option 5 incorrect. Therefore, only option 4 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Organization                  Characteristic/Function
1.  PRET Initiative                        :   Operates independently of the International Health Regulations (IHR)
2.  International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 :   A non-binding agreement among WHO member states
3.  SPECS 2030 Initiative                  :   Aims to address global vision impairment and blindness
4.  The Big Catch-Up Initiative             :   Aimed at boosting childhood vaccination rates globally
5.  International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN) :   Focuses exclusively on preventing the spread of respiratory diseases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PRET Initiative operates under the aegis of the IHR, making option 1 incorrect. The IHR 2005 is a legally binding agreement, not non-binding, making option 2 incorrect. The SPECS 2030 Initiative correctly focuses on addressing global vision impairment and blindness, making option 3 correct. The Big Catch-Up Initiative is accurately described as a global effort to boost childhood vaccination rates, making option 4 correct. The IPSN's focus is broader than just respiratory diseases; it addresses various infectious diseases, making option 5 incorrect. Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to diseases, consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                      Characteristic/Vector
1.  Chikungunya                             :   Primarily transmitted by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes at night
2.  Zika Virus                               :   Cannot be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy
3.  Swine Flu (H1N2)                         :   Transmission exclusively through direct contact with pigs
4.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                :   Transmitted solely through blood-feeding insects
5.  Hepatitis C                              :   Transmitted through contaminated food and water only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, but both *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* are vectors and transmission occurs primarily during the day, making option 1 incorrect. Zika virus *can* be transmitted from mother to fetus, making option 2 incorrect. Swine flu transmission can occur through indirect contact with contaminated environments as well, making option 3 incorrect. LSD can be transmitted through other means besides blood-feeding insects, making option 4 incorrect.  Hepatitis C is not transmitted through food and water; it’s primarily transmitted through blood, making option 5 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                              Characteristic
1.  Lead-Acid (PbA) battery                :   Has a cycle life exceeding 5000 cycles
2.  Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery            :   Uses solid-state electrolytes exclusively
3.  Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery           :   Categorized as a flow battery
4.  Redox Flow Battery (RFB)               :   Uses pairs of plates immersed in electrolyte
5.  Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) Battery :   Stores energy only as electrochemical energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lead-acid batteries have a cycle life significantly less than 5000 cycles, making option 1 incorrect. Lithium-ion batteries utilize both liquid and solid-state electrolytes, not exclusively solid-state, making option 2 incorrect. Sodium-sulfur batteries are standard, not flow, batteries, making option 3 incorrect.  Redox flow batteries are a type of flow battery and do not use pairs of plates immersed in electrolyte in the same way as standard batteries; they use tanks of electrolyte, making option 4 incorrect. ACC batteries can store energy as chemical energy as well, making option 5 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type/Convention                    Characteristic
1.  Fourth-generation nuclear reactor       :   Uses pressurized water for cooling
2.  SMRs                                     :   Have power generation capacity exceeding 300 MWe only
3.  Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, 1963 :   Specifically addresses SMR safety regulations
4.  Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy, 1960 :   Is superseded by the Brussels Supplementary Convention
5.  Brussels Supplementary Convention to the Paris Convention, 1963 :   Is a later agreement than the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fourth-generation reactors often use gas (like helium) for cooling, not pressurized water, making option 1 incorrect. SMRs have a power generation capacity ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe, making option 2 incorrect. The Vienna Convention addresses broader civil liability, not specifically SMR safety regulations, making option 3 incorrect. The Brussels Supplementary Convention is indeed a later agreement than the Paris Convention, making option 4 correct. The Brussels Supplementary Convention is earlier than the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, making option 5 correct. Therefore, only options 4 and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  Net Energy Gain (NEG) and Nuclear Fusion, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Process                           Characteristic
1.  Nuclear Fusion                           :   Involves the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei
2.  Plasma                                   :   A state of matter consisting of neutral atoms and molecules

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Fortified rice kernels (FRKs) do indeed contain Iron, Vitamin B9 (folic acid), and Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamine). Industrially produced trans fats are formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils.  However, biofortification is *not* a post-harvest method; it's a breeding process.  FSSAI does *not* permit protein binders in dairy products.  And finally, non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) do not always contain zero calories; some have very low calorie content.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.

5.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                         :   Affects only cattle


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Tuberculosis is preventable with the BCG vaccine. Bone marrow transplants can cure sickle cell disease. Chikungunya is mosquito-borne.  Zika virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.  However, Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) can affect other animals besides cattle.  Therefore, option (b) is the most accurate.  Option (c) is incorrect because of the inclusion of LSD’s characteristic.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Term/Concept                              Description
1. Generic Drug                                      :   Marketed after patent expiry of branded drug
2. Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Drug                 :   Always requires prior approval from DCGI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Generic drugs are marketed after the patent expiry of the branded drug.  The API is the biologically active component of a drug. Orphan drugs are indeed for rare diseases.  And the NLEM is used by NPPA for price control.  However, FDCs do not *always* require prior approval from the DCGI; this depends on the specific combination.  Therefore, only options 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to Food Fortification and Related Concepts, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                     Specific Example
1. Micronutrients in Fortified Rice Kernels      :   Iron, Vitamin B12, Vitamin A

4. Ultra-Processed Food (UPF) Example        :    Margarine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Fortified rice kernels indeed include iron, folic acid (Vitamin B9), and Vitamin B12.  Vitamin A is not a standard addition in fortified rice, although other micronutrients might be added depending on regional needs. Biofortification techniques can utilize genetic engineering, but also conventional breeding and agronomic practices.  The FSSAI explicitly prohibits the addition of protein binders to dairy products; they are not permitted as additives.  Margarine is a classic example of an ultra-processed food, often high in unhealthy fats and additives. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are entirely correct.  Option (a) is incomplete, (c) is partially correct but includes a false statement, and (d) is incorrect because it includes the false statement regarding protein binders.


**2. With reference to Traditional Medicine and its Classification, consider the following pairs:**

3. Unani                                      :   A-HIMS platform
4. Traditional Chinese Medicine              :   ICD-11 Module 1

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ICD-11 Module 2 specifically includes Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani systems of medicine. The NAMSTE (National Ayush Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic) portal provides standardized terminologies and morbidity codes for Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. The A-HIMS (Ayush Health Information Management System) is an IT platform managing healthcare in Ayush facilities, including Unani.  ICD-11 Module 1 covers traditional medicine conditions originating in ancient China. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to Non-Sugar Sweeteners (NSS) and their Properties, consider the following pairs:**

    NSS                                        Characteristic
1. Aspartame                                 :   Methyl ester of a dipeptide
2. Acesulfame-K                             :   Derived from fructose
3. Sucralose                                 :   Zero-calorie artificial sweetener
4. Steviol Glycosides                        :   Derived from sugarcane

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aspartame is correctly identified as a methyl ester of a dipeptide. Sucralose is accurately described as a zero-calorie artificial sweetener.  Acesulfame-K is derived from acetoacetic acid, not fructose. Steviol glycosides are derived from the Stevia plant, not sugarcane.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incomplete, (b) is partially correct but includes a false statement, and (d) is incorrect because it includes two false statements.


**4. With reference to Crypto Mining and Related Technologies, consider the following pairs:**

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is mentioned as a cost-effective approach. Subtractive manufacturing is correctly identified as the opposite of additive manufacturing (3D printing). Stereolithography (SLA) uses light to cure resin layers. 4-D printing uses a wider range of materials than just hydrogels;  it employs materials that change shape in response to stimuli. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incomplete, (c) is partially correct but includes a false statement, and (d) is incorrect because pair 2 is false.


**6. With reference to  Gene Editing Technologies, consider the following pairs:**

2. SDN 2                                      :   Indistinguishable from conventionally bred crops
3. SDN 3                                      :   Uses CRISPR technology
4.  GMOs                                      :   Modification of existing genetic material


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

SDN 2 accurately describes gene editing techniques that don't involve foreign genes and result in products indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties. SDN 3 correctly utilizes CRISPR technology as one of its applications. SDN 1 is incorrectly described; it does *not* involve alien genetic material. GMOs are characterized by the introduction of foreign genes, the opposite of what is stated in pair 4. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect, (c) is partially correct but includes a false statement, and (d) is incorrect because it includes two false statements.


**7. With reference to  Genome Sequencing and Related Concepts, consider the following pairs:**

2. Long-read sequencing                        :   Easier assembly for repetitive sequences
3. Y-chromosome                               :   Largest human chromosome
4. Human Genome Project (HGP)                 :   Sequenced 100% of human genome


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Short-read sequencing is indeed more effective for counting specific sequences. Long-read sequencing excels at handling repetitive sequences like those found in the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome is not the largest human chromosome; that would be chromosome 1. The Human Genome Project (HGP) sequenced approximately 92%, not 100%, of the human genome. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect as pair 3 is false, (c) is incorrect as pair 4 is false, and (d) is incorrect as pairs 3 and 4 are false.


**8. With reference to Quantum Technology and its Applications, consider the following pairs:**

3. Gene-drive Technology (GDT)                :   Alters Mendelian inheritance patterns
4.  Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT) :   Uses only two parents' DNA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Genome editing can involve modifying existing genes without introducing foreign genes,  so statement 1 is incorrect. While CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful genome editing tool, it is not inherently a gene-drive technology. Gene-drive technology does indeed aim to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns to increase the frequency of specific genes in a population. Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT) utilizes DNA from three individuals: the parents and a mitochondrial donor, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.

Hyperloop is indeed an ultra-high-speed ground transportation system utilizing magnetic levitation for propulsion. The other statements are incorrect. Lagrange Point L1 is an unstable point, but spacecraft can maintain their position with *reduced* fuel consumption, not significant fuel. Nanohybrids are made of nanoparticles, but nanoparticles themselves are less than 100 nm. Genome sequencing determines the order of DNA nucleotides in an organism's *entire* genome, not just a small fragment.  The question assesses conceptual understanding and requires precise knowledge of scientific terms and their definitions to avoid the cleverly designed distractors.

1.  Extrusion-based metal AM                   :  A less cost-effective method compared to other metal 3D printing approaches
2.  4D Printing                               :  Prints objects that change shape post-production in response to stimuli
3.  Additive Manufacturing                      :  A subtractive manufacturing process
4.  Computer-aided Design (CAD)                :  Used to create digital models for 3D printing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Extrusion-based metal AM is a cost-effective method, contrary to the statement. 4D printing is accurately described. Additive manufacturing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. CAD is correctly identified as a tool for creating digital models for 3D printing. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing of 3D printing concepts with their descriptions or applications.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (a compilation of facts), creating truly difficult questions that are *not* easily guessable while maintaining complete accuracy is challenging.  The difficulty lies more in the precision of recall and the subtle distinctions between correct and incorrect options than in complex reasoning.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                      Key Feature/Concept
1. Quantum Computing             :   Operates at room temperature
2. Deep Learning                  :   Uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
3. Web 3.0                         :   Centralized data control
4. 3D Printing                     :   Subtractive manufacturing process
5. Wi-Fi 7                         :   Lower latency and Multi-Link Operation (MLO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic data and improve model performance.  Wi-Fi 7 is indeed characterized by lower latency and Multi-Link Operation (MLO), enabling faster and more efficient data transmission.

Pair 1 is incorrect because quantum computers, unlike classical computers, are highly susceptible to noise and high error rates, and do not operate at room temperature.  Pair 3 is incorrect because Web 3.0 is fundamentally about decentralized data control, empowering users rather than centralizing it. Pair 4 is incorrect; 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, building up layers of material, the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which removes material.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology           Application/Characteristic
1. Nuclear Fusion                :   Uses natural uranium as fuel
2. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) :   Achieves Net Energy Gain (NEG)
3. Molybdenum-99 Production     :   Parent isotope of Technetium-99m
4. Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) : Removes Strontium from contaminated water
5.  Tokamak                      :  Used in the Manhattan Project


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Molybdenum-99 is indeed the parent isotope of Technetium-99m, a crucial element in nuclear medicine. The Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) is used to remove radioactive materials, including Strontium, from contaminated water.

Pair 1 is incorrect; nuclear fusion uses light atomic nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen), not natural uranium. Pair 2 is incorrect; while PHWRs are used in nuclear power generation, achieving Net Energy Gain is a goal of fusion reactors, not a characteristic of PHWRs. Pair 5 is incorrect; tokamaks are magnetic confinement devices used in fusion research, not associated with the Manhattan Project (which focused on fission).


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology            Description/Characteristic
1. Quantum Coherence            :   Experimental demonstration of quantum computer's advantage over classical computers
2. Quantum Supremacy           :   Ability of a quantum system to maintain a well-defined quantum state over time
3. Blockchain Technology         :   Centralized digital ledger
4. Cryptocurrency                :   Uses cryptographic techniques for security
5. Artificial Intelligence (AI)   :   Exclusively uses rule-based systems


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Cryptocurrencies do indeed utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

Pair 1 is incorrect; quantum coherence is the ability of a quantum system to maintain its quantum state, not quantum supremacy (which involves demonstrating a quantum computer's superior computational power). Pair 2 is incorrect – see explanation for pair 1. Pair 3 is incorrect; blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger. Pair 5 is incorrect; AI utilizes various techniques, including machine learning and deep learning, not solely rule-based systems.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Technology              Feature/Application
1.  Li-ion Battery                 :   Uses sodium ions as charge carriers
2.  Sodium-ion Battery (SIB)       :   Lower cost compared to Li-ion batteries
3.  Small Modular Reactor (SMR)  :   Uses pressurized water for cooling
4.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) : Stores energy using wind energy exclusively
5.  Gravity Battery                :  Lifts and lowers heavy weights to store energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are indeed known for their lower cost compared to lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium. Gravity batteries operate by lifting and lowering weights to store and release energy.

Pair 1 is incorrect; Li-ion batteries use lithium ions, not sodium ions. Pair 3 is incorrect; many SMR designs use alternative coolants (like helium) to enhance safety and efficiency. Pair 4 is incorrect; while BESS can be used with wind energy, they are not exclusively limited to it and are often paired with solar power.


**5. With reference to the  Web technologies, consider the following pairs:**

   Web Technology              Characteristic
1. Web 1.0                     :  Interactive platforms
2. Web 2.0                     :   Centralized, relies on intermediaries
3. Web 3.0                     :   Peer-to-peer transactions
4. Web 4.0                     :   Decentralized data storage
5. Web 5.0                     :   Symbiotic interaction between humans and machines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Web 2.0 is characterized by its centralized nature and reliance on intermediaries. Web 3.0 emphasizes peer-to-peer interactions and decentralized technologies.  Web 5.0 envisions a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines.

Pair 1 is incorrect; Web 1.0 was primarily static, not interactive. Pair 4 is partially correct in that Web 3.0 *includes* decentralized data storage, but it is not the defining characteristic of Web 4.0; that would be the symbiotic interaction between humans and machines.  The other aspects of Web 5.0 (control over identity, decentralized application development) are not listed but are key components.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Associated Entity/Concept
1.  Nuclear Fusion                 :   Coulomb Barrier
2.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)         :   ITER Project
3.  Manhattan Project (MP)        :   Julius Robert Oppenheimer
4.  Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) :   Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant
5.  Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) :   Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion is a process where two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier one, releasing energy.  The Coulomb Barrier is the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged nuclei that needs to be overcome for fusion to occur. This is a fundamental concept in nuclear fusion physics.  The Net Energy Gain (NEG) is a critical milestone for commercial fusion power, meaning the fusion process generates more energy than it consumes.  The ITER project is an international collaboration aiming to demonstrate NEG from fusion reactors.  Julius Robert Oppenheimer played a crucial role in the Manhattan Project, the American effort to develop the atomic bomb during World War II.  The Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant (KAPP) features Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), a type of nuclear reactor using natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as a moderator. The Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) is used at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station to treat contaminated water. All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                           Description/Example
1.  Tokamak                          :   Device used in fission reactions
2.  JT-60SA                           :   World's largest operational nuclear fusion reactor
3.  Uranium Enrichment              :   Increasing the percentage of U-238
4.  Multinucleon Transfer            :   Process leading to discovery of Uranium-241
5.  EV-to-Grid (V2G) Charging       :   Unidirectional charging of electric vehicles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A tokamak is a magnetic confinement device used in nuclear fusion research, not fission.  JT-60SA is indeed the world's largest experimental nuclear fusion reactor. Uranium enrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235, not U-238, to create nuclear fuel. The discovery of Uranium-241 was indeed facilitated by multinucleon transfer, a nuclear reaction process. EV-to-Grid (V2G) charging is bidirectional, allowing electric vehicles to feed energy back into the grid. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                       Application/Characteristic
1.  Blockchain Technology           :   Centralized data storage
2.  Crypto Mining                    :   Proof-of-Stake (PoS) only
3.  Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) :   Regulates NFTs and DeFi
4.  3D Printing                       :   Subtractive manufacturing process
5.  Wi-Fi 7                           :   Slower than Wi-Fi 6


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Blockchain technology is inherently decentralized, not centralized. Crypto mining is used in both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks. MiCA does not regulate NFTs and DeFi. 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, the opposite of subtractive manufacturing. Wi-Fi 7 is significantly faster than Wi-Fi 6.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Component/System               Description/Function
1.  S-400 Air Defence System       :   Developed by a US-based enterprise
2.  Project Kusha                    :   Short-range surface-to-air missile system
3.  Iron Dome System                :   Intercepts only UAVs
4.  Molybdenum-99 production      :   Parent isotope of Technetium-99m
5.  Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) :   Uses liquid hydrogen as fuel


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The S-400 is a Russian, not a US-developed, air defense system. Project Kusha is a long-range, not short-range, surface-to-air missile system. The Iron Dome intercepts various aerial threats, not just UAVs. Molybdenum-99 is indeed the parent isotope of Technetium-99m, a crucial element in nuclear medicine. DMFCs use liquid methanol, not hydrogen, as fuel.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology              Associated Feature/Application
1.  Quantum Computing              :   Low error rates
2.  Quantum Coherence              :   Loss of quantum state over time
3.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)     :   Bletchley Declaration
4.  Deepfakes                       :   Use of shallow learning algorithms
5.  Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) :   Indoor application only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Quantum computing is characterized by high error rates, not low. Quantum coherence is the ability to maintain a quantum state, the opposite of losing it. The Bletchley Declaration is indeed related to AI safety and regulation. Deepfakes utilize deep learning algorithms, not shallow ones. FSOC is used for outdoor, not solely indoor, applications. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Substance              Property/Application
1.  Graphene                        :   Poor electrical conductivity
2.  Calcium-41                      :   Half-life of 5,700 years
3.  Supercritical Carbon Dioxide    :   Used to enhance oil recovery
4.  Tantalum                        :   Low melting point
5.  White Phosphorus                :   Used in nuclear reactors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphene is known for its excellent electrical conductivity. Calcium-41 has a much longer half-life than 5,700 years (its half-life is 99,400 years). Supercritical carbon dioxide is indeed used in enhanced oil recovery techniques. Tantalum possesses a very high melting point. White phosphorus is not used in nuclear reactors. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Concept/Technology    Description/Application
1.  Biosimilar                       :   Identical to the original biological medicine
2.  International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) :   Excludes traditional medicine
3.  Food Fortification              :   Reduces the risk of iron overload
4.  Trans-fat                        :   Naturally occurring forms are always harmful
5.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)   :   Produced using homogeneous hybrid cells


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biosimilars are very close to, but not identical to, the original biological medicine. ICD-11 includes traditional medicine. Food fortification can increase the risk of iron overload in susceptible individuals. Naturally occurring trans-fats are generally safe. Monoclonal antibodies are indeed produced using homogeneous hybrid cells.  Only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease/Virus                   Characteristic/Transmission
1.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)       :   Primarily affects poultry
2.  Hepatitis C                      :   Effective vaccine available
3.  Nipah Virus (NIV)               :   Transmitted only through direct contact
4.  Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus :   Causes only bird flu
5.  Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)        :   Caused by bacteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lumpy Skin Disease primarily affects cattle, not poultry.  There is no effective vaccine for Hepatitis C. Nipah virus can be transmitted through various routes, including contaminated food. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) can cause both bird flu and human influenza. Lymphatic Filariasis is caused by parasitic worms, not bacteria. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                 Related Entity/Application
1.  Mission Coordination Cell (MCC)  :   National Quantum Mission (NQM)
2.  Quantum Supremacy               :   Classical computer dominance
3.  Param-Sidhhi Supercomputer      :   Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)
4.  Digital India RISC-V Microprocessor (DIR-V) Program :   Development of next-generation microprocessors
5.  Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) :   Regulates Over-the-Top (OTT) services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Mission Coordination Cell (MCC) is indeed related to the National Quantum Mission (NQM). Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer's superiority over classical computers. Param-Sidhhi was used in the development of the ASTR facial recognition system. The DIR-V program aims to develop next-generation microprocessors. TDSAT does *not* regulate OTT services; that falls under the purview of other regulatory bodies. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Lunar Mission Element          Feature/Characteristic
1.  Chandrayaan-1                 :   Soft landing on the Moon
2.  Chandrayaan-3                 :   Landed near the lunar North Pole
3.  Tidal Locking                  :   Causes high diurnal temperature range on the Moon
4.  Aditya-L1                      :   Placed in halo orbit around Lagrange Point L2
5.  Lunar Regolith                 :   Lacks agglutinates



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1 did not perform a soft landing; that was a key achievement of Chandrayaan-3. Chandrayaan-3 landed near the South Pole, not the North Pole. Tidal locking does indeed contribute to the extreme temperature variations on the Moon. Aditya-L1 is positioned around Lagrange Point L1, not L2. Lunar regolith does contain agglutinates. Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include pairs with mismatched information.


**1. With reference to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Function/Characteristic
1.  World Health Organization (WHO)           :   Jointly established the CAC with FAO
2.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) :  Sets quality parameters for millets
3.  Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH) : Finalizes quality standards for cardamom
4.  Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) of WTO :  Recognizes Codex standards as voluntary

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is a joint initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), making pair 1 correct.  The FSSAI, in India, plays a crucial role in setting national standards, including those for millets, which were later adopted as group standards by the CAC; hence pair 2 is correct. The CCSCH, a committee under the CAC, indeed finalized quality standards for various spices, including small cardamom, as stated in the provided text, validating pair 3.  Finally, the WTO's SPS Agreement explicitly recognizes Codex standards, although they are voluntary, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Organ and Tissue Transplantation, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Organization                             Provision/Function
1.  Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 :  Allowed organ donation only from live donors
2.  National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) : Operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs
3.  Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act (THOTA), 2011: Amended the 1994 Act
4.  Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules, 2014 :  Established a national registry of organ donation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, allowed organ donation from both live and brain-stem dead donors, contradicting statement 1. NOTTO functions under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, making statement 2 incorrect.  The Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act (THOTA), 2011, did indeed amend the 1994 Act, making statement 3 correct. However, the national registry of organ and tissue donation and transplantation is established and maintained under the National Organ Transplant Programme, not explicitly by the 2014 Rules, rendering statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to e-cigarettes, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Act                                  Definition/Provision
1.  Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) :  Specifically excluded from the PECA, 2019
2.  Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Act, 2019 (PECA) : Banned e-cigarettes in India
3.  Heat Not Burn Products                    : Included under the definition of e-cigarettes in PECA, 2019
4. Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940            : Products licensed under this act are excluded from PECA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

ENDS are explicitly included in the definition of e-cigarettes under PECA, 2019, making pair 1 incorrect.  PECA 2019 successfully banned e-cigarettes in India, correctly matching pair 2.  Heat Not Burn Products are indeed included in PECA's definition of e-cigarettes, making pair 3 correct.  Furthermore, any product licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, is specifically excluded from the purview of PECA, correctly matching pair 4. Thus, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                      Characteristic/Function
1.  PRET Initiative                             :  Operates under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
2.  International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005:  A legally binding agreement of 196 States Parties
3.  SPECS 2030 Initiative                     : Aims to address global vision impairment and blindness
4.  The Big Catch-Up Initiative                : Implemented by WHO, UNICEF, and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PRET initiative operates under the International Health Regulations (IHR), not the WTO, making pair 1 incorrect.  The IHR 2005 is indeed a legally binding agreement with 196 State Parties, making pair 2 correct. The SPECS 2030 initiative accurately aims to address global vision impairment and blindness, making pair 3 correct.  The Big Catch-Up initiative is correctly described as being implemented by WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, validating pair 4. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to diseases, consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                     Characteristic/Vector

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

3D printing is a process that creates three-dimensional objects by layering materials, not a process involving shape-changing materials post-production.  That is the defining feature of 4D printing.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. 4D printing is an advanced form of 3D printing that incorporates materials capable of changing shape after printing, making pair 2 correctly matched.

Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing has been identified by IIT Mandi researchers as a relatively cost-effective approach compared to other metal 3D printing techniques, making pair 3 correctly matched.  Subtractive manufacturing is the traditional method of removing material to create a desired shape, the opposite of additive manufacturing's layer-by-layer approach. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched.

Only option (b) accurately identifies the correct matches. The other options misrepresent the characteristics of 3D, 4D printing, and traditional manufacturing processes.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Function/Characteristic
1. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)           :   Established in 1963 by the World Trade Organization
2. National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) : Operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs
3. Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)    :   Regulates inter-country adoptions only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is an intergovernmental body jointly established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), not the World Trade Organization, in 1963.  Its primary function is to develop international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice to protect consumer health and to ensure fair practices in the food trade.  Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct.  NOTTO functions under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  CARA regulates both in-country and inter-country adoptions in India.  Thus, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to these factual inaccuracies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                  Specific Provision
1. Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019   :   Allows for the licensing of e-cigarettes under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
2. Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994    :   Originally prohibited organ donation from brain-stem dead donors
3. The Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act, 2011 : Introduced the concept of xenotransplantation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019, explicitly bans e-cigarettes in India, with exceptions only for products licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, but this is not a permission, but rather an exception for already existing products. The 1994 Act permitted organ donation from both live and brain-stem dead donors.  The 2011 amendment primarily aimed to strengthen the regulatory framework and did not introduce xenotransplantation as a legal concept at that time, although it laid some groundwork for future consideration. Hence, all three statements are factually incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                         Implementing/Associated Agency
1. Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative :   UNICEF

3. National Quantum Mission (NQM)              :   Department of Science & Technology (DST)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PRET initiative is a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative.  The National Organ Transplant Programme operates under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Power. The National Quantum Mission (NQM) is indeed implemented by the Department of Science and Technology (DST).  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.

3. Lumpy Skin Disease                             :   Primarily affects poultry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, not Anopheles mosquitoes, which are carriers of malaria. Zika virus is indeed associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder. Lumpy Skin Disease primarily affects cattle, not poultry.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type/System                             Key Feature/Application
1. Lithium-ion battery                           :   Uses a solid electrolyte
2. Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) Battery      :   Stores energy only as chemical energy
3. Gravity battery                               :   Utilizes sodium ions as charge carriers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries utilize liquid electrolytes, not solid electrolytes; solid-state lithium batteries are a distinct type. ACC batteries can store energy electrochemically or chemically. Gravity batteries utilize gravitational potential energy, not sodium ions. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.

(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Web 3.0 is characterized by decentralization and aims to reduce reliance on intermediaries. Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger technology. FSOC uses infrared light, not the visible light spectrum.  Therefore, none of the statements are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Drug/Medicine                                  Characteristic/Use
1.  Generic Drugs                                  :   Always require prior approval from DCGI
2.  Fixed Dose Combination Drugs (FDCs)         :   Always enhance efficacy
3.  Biosimilars                                   :   Identical to biological medicines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Generic drugs do not always require prior approval from DCGI; they are typically marketed after patent expiry. FDCs can sometimes reduce efficacy or increase toxicity. Biosimilars are very similar, but not identical, to biological medicines.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology/Concept                     Description/Feature
1.  Nuclear Fusion                               :   Overcomes Coulomb Barrier easily
2.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)               :   Use pressurized water for cooling
3.  Net Energy Gain (NEG) in Nuclear Fusion    :   Consumes more energy than it produces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion requires significant energy to overcome the Coulomb barrier. SMRs often utilize gas cooling, not pressurized water.  NEG means that the fusion process generates more energy than it consumes. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology/Mission                       Characteristic/Outcome
1. Chandrayaan-3                               :   Landed on the lunar near side
2.  Project Taara                                :   Utilizes stratospheric balloons
3.  Project Loon                                 :   Employs Free Space Optical Communication


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully landed near the lunar south pole. Project Taara uses Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC), not stratospheric balloons. Project Loon utilized stratospheric balloons for internet connectivity. Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.

1.  Wi-Fi 7                                      :   Slower than Wi-Fi 6
2.  Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)         :   Does not use AI processes
3.  Supercomputers                               :   Performance measured in MIPS


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 is significantly faster than Wi-Fi 6. FRT heavily relies on AI algorithms. Supercomputer performance is measured in FLOPS, not MIPS. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Virus                                    Characteristic/Associated Fact
1.  Hepatitis C Virus                     :  Has an effective vaccine available
2.  Nipah Virus (NIV)                   : Transmitted solely through contaminated food
3.  Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus      : Causes only bird flu, never human influenza
4.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) Virus     : Primarily affects poultry, not cattle

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **Hepatitis C Virus:**  The statement is incorrect. There is *no* effective vaccine currently available for Hepatitis C.  Hepatitis A and B, however, do have effective vaccines. This is a common misconception, making it a good distractor.

2. **Nipah Virus (NIV):** This statement is also incorrect. While contaminated food is a route of transmission, Nipah virus can also spread through direct contact between people and from fruit bats (natural hosts).  The question plays on the partial truth to confuse the examinee.

3. **Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus:** The statement is false.  While primarily affecting birds, H9N2 *can* cause human influenza, though it's rare.  This plays on the common association but highlights a crucial detail often overlooked.

4. **Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) Virus:** The statement is incorrect. LSD primarily affects cattle, causing fever, skin nodules, and reduced milk yield.  The question uses a related but incorrect animal to create a plausible distractor.


Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Option (d) is chosen because it is the only option that reflects the inaccuracy of all the pairs.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                    Transmission Method/Characteristic
1.  Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)               : Transmitted through ticks
2.  Noma (Cancrum Oris)                   : Primarily affects adults
3.  Japanese Encephalitis                  : A neglected tropical disease
4. Rabies                                  : Caused by a parasitic nematode


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Again, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's break down the inaccuracies:

1. **Lymphatic Filariasis (LF):** LF is transmitted through mosquitoes, not ticks.  The use of a similar blood-feeding arthropod creates a strong distractor.

2. **Noma (Cancrum Oris):** Noma primarily affects malnourished children aged 2-6 years, not adults.  This plays on a potential misunderstanding of the disease's demographic.

3. **Japanese Encephalitis:** While potentially a serious health concern in tropical regions, Japanese Encephalitis is *not* officially classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) by the WHO. The inclusion of a related but not entirely accurate descriptor is a common UPSC question technique.

4. **Rabies:** Rabies is caused by a virus, not a parasitic nematode.  This utilizes a completely different class of pathogen to mislead.


Therefore, option (d) is selected because all pairs are incorrectly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                        Description/Application
1.  Phage Therapy                            : Uses bacteriophages to treat viral infections
2.  Macrophages                               :  A type of virus that attacks bacterial cells
3.  Nuclear Medicine                          : Exclusively uses non-ionizing radiation
4.  HeLa Cells                                 : The first human cells to exhibit senescence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The inaccuracies are:

1. **Phage Therapy:** Phage therapy uses bacteriophages to treat *bacterial*, not viral infections.  This plays on the similar-sounding terms to create confusion.

2. **Macrophages:** Macrophages are a type of *white blood cell*, not a virus. They are part of the body's immune system.  The replacement with a completely different biological entity is a key distractor.

3. **Nuclear Medicine:** Nuclear medicine *does* use ionizing radiation, which carries inherent risks. The omission of a crucial detail is a common question-setting technique.

4. **HeLa Cells:** HeLa cells were the first human cells to be successfully *cloned* and importantly, they *never* reached senescence (the point where cells stop dividing). This subtle but significant difference is a strong distractor that demands precise knowledge.


Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer as all pairs are incorrectly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Sweetener                                 Characteristic
1. Aspartame                               : A polyhydric alcohol
2. Acesulfame-K                             : Derived from Acetoacetic acid
3. Sucralose                                 : Made from sugar through a chemical process
4. Thaumatin                                : 100-250 times sweeter than sugar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Only two pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **Aspartame:** This is incorrect. Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide, not a polyhydric alcohol (like sorbitol).  The substitution of a chemically related but distinct substance is a sophisticated distractor.

2. **Acesulfame-K:** This is correctly matched.  Acesulfame-K is indeed derived from acetoacetic acid.

3. **Sucralose:** This is correctly matched. Sucralose is a zero-calorie sweetener produced from sugar through chemical modification.

4. **Thaumatin:** This is incorrect. While Thaumatin is an intensely sweet protein, it's not 100-250 times sweeter than sugar; that description better fits monk fruit extract.  The use of a similar high-intensity sweetener creates confusion.


Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Nuclear Technology/Concept               Description/Application
1.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses enriched uranium as fuel

3.  Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS): Removes Strontium from contaminated water at Fukushima
4.  Tokamak                                  : A magnetic fusion device designed to tap into the potential of fusion energy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR):**  Incorrect. PHWRs use *natural*, not enriched uranium as fuel.  This plays on the general knowledge of uranium's role in nuclear reactors without requiring specific knowledge of PHWRs.

2. **Molybdenum-99:** Correct. Molybdenum-99 is indeed the parent isotope of Technetium-99m, a crucial element in nuclear medicine.

3. **Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS):** Correct. ALPS was specifically designed to remove various radionuclides, including strontium, from the contaminated water at Fukushima.

4. **Tokamak:** Correct. A tokamak is a device that uses magnetic confinement to create and control plasma for nuclear fusion research.


Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option.  The incorrect pairing of PHWRs with enriched uranium is a subtle but effective distractor.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Astra Missile                       :   A short-range, air-to-air missile with a range of 110 km

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dhanush is indeed a 155 mm, 45-calibre towed artillery gun, not a 52-calibre one.  The provided description in option 1 is therefore incorrect.  Varunastra is a ship-launched anti-submarine torpedo, but its maximum speed is 40 knots, not 50 knots, making option 2 also incorrect. The Astra missile is an air-to-air missile with a range that extends beyond 80 km and up to 160 km depending on the variant (Mk1 and Mk2), making option 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in descriptions. The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring careful attention to detail.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Project 17A is the Niligiri class of frigates, not the Shivalik class, making statement 1 incorrect. Project 17 is the Shivalik class, not the Niligiri class, rendering statement 2 incorrect. Project 75 (India) involves the construction of six conventional submarines, with the Kalvari class being one of the submarines built under this project.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall of Indian naval projects and their corresponding frigate classes. The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related projects.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Tidal locking correctly describes the phenomenon where one side of a celestial body is always facing another, as seen with the Moon and Earth.  A gravity assist flyby is a legitimate spaceflight maneuver that uses a planet's gravity to change a spacecraft's velocity, making statement 2 correct.  Lagrange Point L1 is an unstable point, not a stable one, where gravitational forces partially cancel out, not completely.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question assesses understanding of astronomical concepts and spaceflight techniques. The incorrect option includes a partially correct statement, emphasizing the necessity of precise knowledge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Graphene does exhibit anomalous giant magnetoresistance (GMR) at room temperature, a phenomenon that is exploited in various technological applications. Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator, a defining characteristic used in electronic devices. Superconductors exhibit zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature (which is typically very low, not high). The question tests factual knowledge of material science. The incorrect pairing is a distractor designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of superconductivity and its temperature dependence.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tuberculosis Type                     Drug Resistance
1. Extrapulmonary TB                 : Resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
2. Multidrug Resistance TB (MDR)     : Prevents extrapulmonary TB but not pulmonary TB
3. Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) : Resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the definition of Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) accurately reflects its resistance to all first- and second-line TB drugs.  The other options are incorrect. Extrapulmonary TB does not inherently imply a specific drug resistance profile; resistance can vary depending on the specific strain and prior treatment.  Similarly, Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is defined by resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, not by preventing a specific type of TB.  The statement in option 2 is a characteristic of another TB type, possibly a less severe form or one that hasn't developed resistance to those key drugs.  Therefore, only option (c) presents a factual and precise match.  Understanding the nuances of drug resistance in different tuberculosis types is crucial for effective treatment strategies. The classification and definitions used here align with standard medical terminology and guidelines for TB management.

(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).  NOTTO (National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation) operates under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The National Organ Transplant Programme is related to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 (although its establishment predates the 2011 amendment). The PRET (Preparedness and Resilience For Emerging Threats) Initiative operates under the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005.  The SPECS 2030 Initiative is a WHO initiative, but it's implemented in collaboration with several partners, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly include or exclude pairs. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                  Defining Characteristic/Feature
1. E-cigarettes                               :   Licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
2.  Quantum Computing                         :   Based on principles of superposition and entanglement
3.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)                :   Exclusively uses Generative AI models
4.  Deepfakes                                  :   Utilize only Variational Autoencoders
5.  Web 3.0                                   :   Centralized data management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Quantum computing leverages the principles of superposition and entanglement, which are fundamental quantum phenomena. The other statements are inaccurate. E-cigarettes are explicitly excluded from products licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. AI encompasses various models, not just Generative AI. Deepfakes utilize multiple AI techniques, including GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), not solely Variational Autoencoders. Web 3.0 is characterized by decentralized data management, not centralized control.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology                       Description/Application
1.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)   :   Exclusively uses Lead-Acid batteries

3.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)           :   Uses only pressurized water for cooling
4.  Nuclear Fusion                           :   Consumes more energy than it produces
5.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)                    :   Achieved only in theoretical models


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. BESS utilizes various battery types, not just Lead-Acid. Li-ion batteries use ether-based electrolytes, not water. SMRs can utilize different cooling methods, including gas cooling.  Nuclear fusion aims to achieve net energy gain, and while it hasn't been commercially achieved yet, experimental results show progress towards this goal. Net energy gain is a scientific goal, not limited to theoretical models.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology/Concept              Characteristic/Application
1.  Biosimilar                               :   Identical to the original biological medicine
2.  International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11):  Excludes traditional medicine
3.  Food Fortification                         :   Always improves health outcomes
4.  Trans-fat                                 :   Naturally occurring forms are always harmful

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Biosimilars are very similar, but not identical, to the original biological medicine. ICD-11 explicitly includes traditional medicine. Food fortification can have negative consequences for certain individuals. Naturally occurring trans-fats are generally safe. NSS can vary in calorie content.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                        Related Term/Concept
1.  Blockchain Technology                     :   Centralized data management
2.  Crypto Mining                             :   Proof-of-Stake only
3.  Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)           :   Regulates all crypto assets
4.  3D Printing                               :   Subtractive manufacturing
5.  Wi-Fi 7                                    :   No backward compatibility


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrectly matched. Blockchain technology is inherently decentralized. Crypto mining uses both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake. MiCA does not regulate all crypto assets, excluding certain categories. 3D printing is additive, not subtractive. Wi-Fi 7 maintains backward compatibility.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                   Transmission Method/Characteristic
1.  Chikungunya                              :   Transmitted solely through air
2.  Zika Virus                                :   Not transmitted from mother to fetus
3.  Swine Flu Strain H1N2                     :   Exclusively transmitted through human contact
4.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                  :   Transmitted only through direct contact
5.  Hepatitis C                              :   Always displays immediate symptoms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None

2.  Rare Earth Elements (REEs)               :   Used only in low-end technology
3.  Vanadium                                 :   Not used in batteries
4.  Lab-Grown Diamonds (LGDs)               :   Always more expensive than natural diamonds
5.  Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)           :   Unaffected by magnetic fields


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Superconductivity is characterized by zero resistance below a critical temperature. REEs are crucial for high-end technologies. Vanadium is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries. LGDs can be more affordable than natural diamonds. GMR's functionality is directly influenced by magnetic fields.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology/Treatment              Description/Application
1.  CRISPR-based Gene Therapies           :   Ineffective for treating genetic diseases
2.  National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission:   Focuses only on adults
3.  Generic Drugs                             :   Always more expensive than brand-name drugs
4.  Fixed Dose Combination Drugs (FDCs)     :   Always have improved efficacy
5.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)           :   Bind to multiple antigens


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrectly matched. CRISPR-based gene therapies are designed to treat genetic diseases. The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission includes children and young adults. Generic drugs are typically cheaper than brand-name drugs. FDCs can have reduced efficacy or increased toxicity. mAbs are designed to bind to a single, specific antigen.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Viral Disease                     Transmission Method
1.  Lumpy Skin Disease             :   Blood-feeding insects
2.  Hepatitis C                      :   Reuse of medical equipment
3.  Nipah Virus                      :   Fruit bats
4.  Avian Influenza A (H9N2)     :   Contact with infected poultry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lumpy skin disease is transmitted by blood-feeding insects like certain species of flies, mosquitoes, and ticks.  Hepatitis C is primarily transmitted through the reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, particularly syringes and needles. Nipah virus is zoonotic, with fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae and genus Pteropus serving as natural hosts.  Transmission to humans can occur through contaminated food or direct contact. Avian influenza A (H9N2) is transmitted through exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.  All the pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                     Characteristic
1.  Lymphatic Filariasis                 :   Caused by bacteria
2.  Noma                                   :   Affects mainly adults
3.  Hepatitis B                           :   Effective vaccine available
4.  Tuberculosis                          :   Always pulmonary

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) is caused by parasitic nematodes (roundworms), not bacteria. Noma (cancrum oris) primarily affects malnourished children aged 2-6 years, not adults.  An effective vaccine is available for Hepatitis B, unlike Hepatitis C. Tuberculosis can be both pulmonary and extrapulmonary. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or incorrectly state that none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Term/Concept                 Description
1.  Phage Therapy                       :   Uses bacteriophages to treat viral infections
2.  Macrophages                         :   Type of white blood cell that attacks healthy tissue
3.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)      :   Produced from heterogeneous hybrid cells
4.  HeLa Cells                           :   First human cells to be successfully cloned

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Phage therapy utilizes bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections. Macrophages are indeed white blood cells that are part of the body's first line of defense against infection, they do not attack healthy tissue (that's a characteristic of autoimmune diseases). Monoclonal antibodies are produced from homogeneous (identical) hybrid cells, not heterogeneous ones. HeLa cells were the first human cells to be successfully cloned.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or incorrectly state that only a subset of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                      Application
1.  Optical Tweezers                    :   Study of large-scale structures in galaxies
2.  Nuclear Medicine                     :   Uses radioactive tracers for diagnosis and treatment
3.  Inverse Vaccine                       :   Treats bacterial infections
4.  Genome Editing (CRISPR/Cas9)       :   Creating low-pungent mustard varieties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Optical tweezers are used to manipulate microscopic objects, not for studying large-scale structures in galaxies. Nuclear medicine uses radioactive tracers for diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Inverse vaccines aim to re-educate the immune system to ignore self-antigens in autoimmune diseases, not to treat bacterial infections. Genome editing, specifically CRISPR/Cas9 technology, has been successfully used to create low-pungent mustard varieties. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source/Technology              Characteristic
1.  Li-ion Battery                         :   Uses sodium ions as charge carriers
2.  Small Modular Reactor (SMR)          :   Uses gas cooling
3.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) :   Stores energy using wind energy
4.  Net Energy Gain (NEG) in Fusion      :   Consumes more energy than it produces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Li-ion batteries use lithium ions, not sodium ions. Small modular reactors often utilize gas cooling, a key differentiator from traditional pressurized water reactors.  Battery energy storage systems typically store energy from renewable sources like solar, not necessarily wind.  Net energy gain in fusion means the process produces more energy than it consumes. Thus, only statement 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Defense System/Technology          Characteristic
1.  S-400 Air Defence System         :   Short-range air defense system
2.  Project Kusha                       :   Development of short-range surface-to-air missiles
3.  Iron Dome                           :   Intercepts ballistic missiles
4.  David's Sling                       :   Short-range surface-to-air missile system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The S-400 is a long-range, not short-range, air defense system. Project Kusha involves the development of long-range surface-to-air missiles. The Iron Dome system is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells, not necessarily ballistic missiles. David's Sling is a medium-to-long-range air defense system, not a short-range one.  Only the statement regarding the Iron Dome's capability to intercept ballistic missiles is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or incorrectly state that none of the pairs are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                      Transmission Mode
1.  Lymphatic Filariasis                        :   Blood-feeding insects
2.  Nipah Virus                               :   Contaminated food
3.  Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus            :   Exposure to infected poultry
4.  Hepatitis C                               :   Reuse of unsterilized medical equipment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is primarily transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes.  The statement accurately reflects this mode of transmission. Nipah virus, a zoonotic virus, can indeed be transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food (particularly fruit) from infected animals, such as fruit bats.  The virus can also spread directly between humans through close contact. Avian influenza A (H9N2), a subtype of influenza A virus, is transmitted through close contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments.  Exposure to infected birds or their droppings is a significant transmission route. Hepatitis C virus is commonly transmitted through the reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, especially syringes and needles. This is particularly relevant in healthcare settings where such practices can lead to outbreaks. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Viral Disease                     Vaccine Availability
1.  Hepatitis A                       :   Available
2.  Hepatitis B                       :   Available
3.  Hepatitis C                       :   Not Available
4.  Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus :   Available (for chickens)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Effective vaccines are available for both Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, making statements 1 and 2 correct.  Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for Hepatitis C, making statement 3 accurate.  While a vaccine for avian influenza A (H9N2) is not routinely available for humans, an inactivated vaccine has been developed for chickens by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD), making statement 4 also correct.  All four pairs accurately reflect the current status of vaccine availability for these diseases. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, encompassing all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease Category              Disease Example
1.  Neglected Tropical Disease     :   Noma
2.  Notifiable Disease             :   Leprosy
3.  Zoonotic Disease               :   Rabies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

Noma (cancrum oris), a severe gangrenous disease affecting the mouth and face, is categorized by the WHO as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), making pair 1 correct.  Leprosy is a notifiable disease, meaning it is legally mandated to be reported to health authorities, making pair 2 correct. Rabies, transmitted from animals to humans, is a classic example of a zoonotic disease, making pair 3 correct.  All three pairs accurately reflect the classification of these diseases. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, excluding at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                     Description
1.  Phage Therapy                           :   Uses bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections
2.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)          :   Produced by homogeneous hybrid cells
3.  Optical Tweezers                         :   Use a focused laser beam to manipulate microscopic objects
4.  Inverse Vaccine                           :   Makes the immune system "forget" a specific molecule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Phage therapy utilizes bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to combat bacterial infections, making statement 1 correct.  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are indeed produced by homogeneous hybrid cells (hybridomas), which are clones of a single antibody-producing B cell, making statement 2 correct. Optical tweezers employ a highly focused laser beam to trap and manipulate microscopic objects, making statement 3 correct. Inverse vaccines aim to re-educate the immune system to ignore specific self-antigens, effectively making it "forget" these molecules in the context of autoimmune diseases, making statement 4 correct.  All four pairs accurately describe the given technologies/concepts. Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Term/Concept                    Description
1.  Senescent Cells                         :   Cells that do not die and accumulate in tissues
2.  Macrophages                             :   White blood cells that act as the body's first line of defense against infection
3.  HeLa Cells                               :   First human cells successfully cloned

4. Recombinant DNA technology                   :  Exclusively used in plant genetic modification


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 uses guide RNA to target specific DNA sequences, not zinc finger nucleases. SDN 1 and SDN 2, site-directed nucleases, do not involve alien genetic material. Genome editing accurately describes the modification of existing genetic material. Recombinant DNA technology has broader applications than just plant genetic modification. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to  Space Missions and Technologies, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission/Technology                           Key Finding/Feature
1. Chandrayaan-3                               : Confirmed the presence of Sulphur near the lunar South Pole
2.  Project Loon                                 : Utilizes stratospheric balloons for internet connectivity
3.  Starlink                                     :  Uses geostationary satellites for internet access
4.  Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III : Used to launch Chandrayaan-3


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully detected the presence of sulphur on the Moon's surface near the South Pole. Project Loon did indeed use stratospheric balloons for internet connectivity. The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III was the launch vehicle for Chandrayaan-3. Starlink uses a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites, not geostationary satellites.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Government Initiative**                     **Ministry/Department**
1. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. National Health Mission (NHM) Free Drugs Service Initiative : Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
3. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals : Ministry of Commerce and Industry
4. Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945              :  Department of Pharmaceuticals

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched in 2008 by the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.  Option 1 is thus incorrect. The National Health Mission's (NHM) Free Drugs Service Initiative falls under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, making option 2 incorrect. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, making option 3 correct.  Finally, the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, are a key regulatory framework under the Department of Pharmaceuticals, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Generic Medicines in India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Regulatory Act/Body**                      **Provision Regarding Generic Medicines**
1. Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 : Mandates the sale of generic medicines even if prescriptions specify branded versions.
2. National Medical Commission Act, 2019      :  Empowers state medical councils to take disciplinary action against doctors for not prescribing generics.
3. Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945            : Makes it mandatory to grant licenses for drug formulations with a single active ingredient in its proper name.
4. Drugs Technical Advisory Board of India (DTAB) : Prescribes that every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Medical Council regulations encourage generic prescribing but don't mandate the sale of generics over branded ones; that's the role of the DTAB. The National Medical Commission Act does empower state medical councils to take disciplinary action against doctors for violating prescribing guidelines, including the preference for generics. The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, correctly focus on licensing for single-ingredient drugs using their proper names, facilitating generic availability. The DTAB, not the IMC regulations, allows pharmacies to sell generic medicines even when branded versions are specified on prescriptions. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Traditional Medicine System**             **Related Database/Portal**
1. Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (ASU)       : NAMSTE portal
2. Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (ASU)       : Ayush Health Information Management System (A-HIMS)
3. Traditional Medicine from ancient China : ICD-11 Module 1
4.  Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (ASU)       : ICD-11 Module 2


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NAMSTE portal provides standardized terminologies and morbidity codes specifically for Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani systems of medicine.  A-HIMS is a comprehensive IT platform for managing healthcare delivery and patient care in Ayush facilities. ICD-11 Module 1 indeed covers traditional medicine conditions originating in ancient China.  Crucially, ICD-11 Module 2 is dedicated to Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani (ASU) data and terminology. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Food Fortification in India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Fortification Program/Initiative**         **Micronutrient(s)**
1. Fortified rice kernels (FRKs)                 : Iron, Vitamin B9 (folic acid), Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)
2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0          :  Iron, Iodine, Vitamin A
3. Centrally sponsored pilot scheme on “Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System” : Zinc, Vitamin D
4.  Biofortification                          :  Genetically enhanced micronutrient content


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fortified rice kernels (FRKs) in India are mandated to contain Iron, Vitamin B9 (folic acid), and Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin).  While Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 involve food fortification, the specific micronutrients may vary beyond just iron, folic acid, and Vitamin B12. The centrally sponsored rice fortification scheme primarily focuses on Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12, not Zinc and Vitamin D. Biofortification, by definition, involves breeding micronutrients into crops through genetic modification or agronomic practices. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are definitively correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Rare Disease**                           **Treatment Category (NPRD 2021)**
1. Tyrosinemia-Type 1                         : Group 2 (long-term treatment, relatively lower cost)
2. Gaucher's Disease                          : Group 1 (one-time curative treatment)
3. Wilson’s Disease                            : Group 3 (very high cost, lifelong therapy)
4. Dravet or Lennox Gastaut Syndrome         : Group 2 (long-term treatment, relatively lower cost)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for Rare Diseases (2021) categorizes rare diseases into three groups based on treatment costs and duration. Tyrosinemia Type 1 and Dravet/Lennox Gastaut syndrome generally require prolonged and expensive management, placing them in Group 2 or Group 3 depending on individual circumstances. Wilson's disease often necessitates lifelong, costly treatment, fitting into Group 3. Gaucher's disease, while requiring ongoing care,  might fall under Group 2 or Group 3 depending on the specific treatment approach and individual response.  Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 show a more accurate reflection of the categorisation.  The categorization can be nuanced and vary based on specific cases.



**6. With reference to Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Drugs, consider the following pairs:**

   **Aspect of FDCs**                       **Characteristic**
1.  Merits                                     : Enhanced toxicity
2. Demerits                                  : Increased efficacy
3.  Regulation in India                         : Drugs & Cosmetics (Amendment) Act, 2008
4.  Approval Process for New FDCs             : Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While FDCs offer the merit of increased efficacy and reduced cost, enhanced toxicity is a potential demerit, making option 1 incorrect.  Conversely, increased efficacy is a merit, not a demerit. The Drugs & Cosmetics (Amendment) Act, 2008, plays a significant role in regulating FDCs in India.  New FDCs require prior approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), a correct statement.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Type of Non-Sugar Sweetener (NSS)**   **Chemical Basis/Source**
1. Aspartame                                 : Methyl ester of a dipeptide, containing aspartic acid and phenylalanine
2. Acesulfame-K                               : Derived from aceto-acetic acid
3. Sucralose                                  :  A zero-calorie artificial sweetener made from sugar
4. Steviol Glycosides                          :  Natural constituents of Stevia rebaudiana leaves


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aspartame's chemical structure accurately reflects its description as a methyl ester of a dipeptide composed of aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Acesulfame-K is correctly identified as being derived from aceto-acetic acid. Sucralose's origin from sugar through chemical processing is also accurate.  Steviol glycosides are indeed natural constituents of the Stevia rebaudiana plant.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to  Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), consider the following pairs:**

    **Aspect of SCD**                        **Characteristic/Treatment**
1.  Inheritance                             : Inherited when a child receives one gene for abnormal hemoglobin from each parent.
2.  Symptoms                                : Include jaundice, liver and spleen enlargement
3.  Cure                                      : Stem cell or bone marrow transplants
4.  Prevalence in India                    : More common in populations historically endemic to malaria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A child inherits SCD when they receive two genes for abnormal hemoglobin, one from each parent, not just one.  Jaundice, liver, and spleen enlargement are indeed symptoms. Stem cell or bone marrow transplants represent the only known cure for SCD.  The higher prevalence of SCD in certain Indian populations is linked to historical malaria endemicity because of the evolutionary advantage conferred by the sickle cell trait in malaria-prone regions.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   **Viral Disease**                           **Transmission Vector**
1. Chikungunya                               : Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes
2. Zika Virus                                 : Aedes aegypti mosquitoes
3. Swine Flu (H1N2)                           : Direct or indirect contact with infected pigs
4. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                   : Blood-feeding insects (flies, mosquitoes, ticks)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The Zika virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Swine flu (H1N2) transmission occurs through direct or indirect contact with infected pigs or contaminated environments. Lumpy skin disease spreads via blood-feeding insects like certain flies, mosquitoes, and ticks.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to  Tuberculosis (TB), consider the following pairs:**

    **Type of TB**                           **Drug Resistance Characteristic**
1. Pulmonary TB                              : Resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
2. Multidrug Resistance TB (MDR-TB)       : Resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one injectable second-line drug
3. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) : Resistance to all first- and second-line TB drugs
4. Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) : Resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pulmonary TB doesn't inherently define drug resistance; drug resistance applies to various TB forms, including pulmonary TB. MDR-TB accurately describes resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, plus additional drugs. XDR-TB correctly describes resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, and at least one injectable second-line drug. TDR-TB is defined as resistance to all first- and second-line drugs, not just isoniazid and rifampicin. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The definitions of MDR-TB, XDR-TB, and TDR-TB are precise.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Weapon System                      Developer/Manufacturer
1. Dhanush Artillery Gun             :  Bharat Dynamics Limited
2. Varunastra Torpedo                 :  Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers
3. Neerakshi AUV                     :  Naval Science and Technological Laboratory
4. BrahMos Missile                    :  Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Dhanush artillery gun is an indigenously built long-range artillery gun, but its development and production are primarily attributed to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), not Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), although BDL might be involved in some aspects of production.  Varunastra is an indigenous ship-launched anti-submarine torpedo designed and developed by the Naval Science and Technological Laboratory (NSTL) under DRDO and manufactured by Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), not Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE). Neerakshi AUV was developed in collaboration between GRSE and Aerospace Engineering Private Ltd (AEPL), not solely by NSTL.  While BrahMos is used on ships built by MDL, its development and production are a joint venture between India and Russia, not solely attributed to MDL.  The pairings deliberately mix up developers and manufacturers to create plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of Indian defense systems.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Missile System                       Feature
1. Pralay Ballistic Missile            :   Hypersonic speed
2. Astra Missile                        :   Surface-to-surface
3. Spike NLOS Anti-Tank Missile       :   Beyond Visual Range


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Pralay ballistic missile is a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), not hypersonic. The Astra missile is an air-to-air missile, not a surface-to-surface missile. The Spike NLOS is an anti-tank guided missile, but its key feature is its long range and fire-and-forget capability, not being Beyond Visual Range (BVR) exclusively—although it can operate beyond visual range.  The question tests detailed knowledge of missile characteristics and deliberately uses incorrect or partially correct attributes to create challenging distractors.


**3. With reference to Project 17A Frigates, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                    Description
1. Stealth Features                         :  Based on Shivalik Class Frigates
2. Weapons & Sensors                      :  Indigenous torpedo launchers
3. Platform Management Systems           : Designed by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Options 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Project 17A frigates are an improved class over Project 17 (Shivalik Class), featuring enhanced stealth features, but the statement "Based on Shivalik Class Frigates" is an oversimplification; they are a follow-on class with significant improvements. The frigates do incorporate indigenous torpedo launchers as part of their advanced weapons systems.  The design of the Project 17A ships was indeed undertaken by the Indian Navy’s Warship Design Bureau.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of warship development and uses a slightly misleading description in option 1 to increase difficulty.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Nuclear Technology                    Application
1.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)       :   Used in Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant
2.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) :  Uses gas for cooling
3.  Molybdenum-99 Production           :   Produces Technetium-99m for medical use


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correctly matched. While SMRs are a type of reactor, the Kakrapar plant uses PHWRs. PHWRs utilize heavy water as a moderator, not gas for cooling. Molybdenum-99 is indeed a key precursor in the production of Technetium-99m, a crucial isotope in nuclear medicine. The question deliberately includes incorrect pairings of nuclear technologies with their applications to test specific knowledge and differentiate between similar reactor types.


**5. With reference to Cluster Bombs, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                   Description
1. Canisters                                 :   Carry bomblets launched from missiles only
2. Bomblets (sub-munitions)                 :   Explode on impact
3. Timer Fuse                                :   Determines explosion height


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correct. Cluster bombs use canisters that can be deployed from various platforms (aircraft, missiles, artillery), not just missiles. Bomblets are designed to explode near or on the ground, not necessarily on impact. The timer fuse is a crucial component that dictates the detonation height above the target. The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the technical aspects of cluster munitions and employs incorrect or incomplete descriptions in options 1 and 2 to increase the challenge.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Battery                        Characteristic
1. Lithium-ion Battery                    : Uses a solid electrolyte
2. Flow Battery                           : Includes Lead-Acid batteries
3. Sodium-ion Battery                    : Low cost and abundant sodium


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correctly matched.  While lithium-ion batteries are commonly used, they typically employ liquid electrolytes, not solid-state electrolytes (although solid-state versions are under development). Flow batteries are a distinct category and do not include lead-acid batteries.  Sodium-ion batteries are indeed characterized by their lower cost and the abundance of sodium. The question tests knowledge of battery types and their specific features, using plausible but incorrect attributes to raise the difficulty level.


**7.  With reference to the Nobel Prize in Physics 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Awardee                                     Contribution
1. Pierre Agostini                         :  Generation of attosecond pulses of light
2. Ferenc Krausz                           :  Study of electron dynamics in matter
3. Anne L’Huillier                          : Production of verified attosecond pulses in a ‘train’


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only options 1 and 2 are correctly matched. While all three laureates contributed to the understanding of attosecond pulses and electron dynamics, the specific contributions are as follows: Pierre Agostini and Ferenc Krausz worked on producing verified attosecond pulses in a 'train,' while Anne L’Huillier's work focused on the generation of attosecond pulses of light through a novel method.  The question tests recall of specific contributions of individual Nobel laureates and uses subtle differences in their achievements to create difficult distractors.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023 Awardee     Contribution
1. Moungi G. Bawendi                     :  Discovery of size-dependent quantum effects in coloured glass
2. Louis E. Brus                           :  Development of a technique to make QDs of well-defined sizes
3. Aleksey Ekimov                         :  First to prove size-dependent quantum effects in particles in fluid


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The contributions of the Nobel laureates are as follows: Alexei Ekimov's research demonstrated size-dependent quantum effects in colored glass; Louis Brus was the first to show these effects in freely suspended particles in a fluid; Moungi Bawendi developed methods to synthesize high-quality quantum dots of highly controlled sizes. The question deliberately mismatches the laureates with their actual research to test precise knowledge and create challenging distractors.


**9. With reference to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                                  Description
1.  Nucleoside base modifications          :  Increased mRNA instability
2.  In vitro transcribed mRNA              :  Triggers inflammatory reactions
3.  mRNA vaccines                           :  Teach cells to make a protein that triggers an immune response


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Nucleoside base modifications were crucial to *reducing* mRNA instability and inflammatory reactions. In vitro transcribed mRNA, before the Nobel laureates' work, did indeed trigger inflammatory responses, and mRNA vaccines fundamentally work by instructing cells to produce a protein triggering an immune response.  The question tests understanding of the scientific challenges addressed by the Nobel laureates and uses a partially correct but misleading description in option 1 to increase the difficulty.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

       Technology                          Description
1.  Gene-drive Technology                 :   Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance
2.  CRISPR Technology                     :   Uses zinc finger nucleases
3.  Genome Sequencing                      :   Always uses long-read techniques


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

4. Nipah Virus (NIV)                         :   Fruit bats and contaminated food
5. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Virus          :   Exposure to infected poultry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is primarily transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes, not ticks.  Zika virus is indeed transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes and can also spread through sexual contact. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is correctly paired with its transmission via blood-feeding insects.  Nipah virus transmission through fruit bats and contaminated food is accurate. Avian Influenza A (H9N2) is correctly linked to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect due to the inaccurate transmission mode for Chikungunya. Option (b) is also partially incorrect because of the same reason. Option (d) is wrong as it includes the partially incorrect pairing of Chikungunya.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Virus                                       Characteristic/Treatment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) is an NTD caused by parasitic nematodes (roundworms), not bacteria. Noma is a severe gangrenous disease primarily affecting children, not adults. Tuberculosis is a notifiable disease and is preventable with a vaccine. Hepatitis B is a viral liver infection, and a vaccine is available. Sickle cell disease is a genetic condition affecting red blood cell shape. Thus, only 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Technique                      Application/Description

(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Phage therapy utilizes bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections. Genome editing (SDN) accurately describes its function in modifying existing genetic material. Gene-drive technology modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance. Recombinant DNA technology correctly describes its ability to transfer genes across species. Enzyme replacement therapy is accurately described as replacing malfunctioning enzymes.  Therefore, 3, 4 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair concerning phage therapy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology                       Description/Application
1.  Genome Sequencing (Long-read)        :   Breaks genome into small fragments

3.  Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)                  :   Fragments of DNA found outside cells
4.  Optical Tweezers                        :   Uses laser beam to manipulate microscopic objects
5.  HeLa Cells                               :   First human cells to be successfully cloned


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Long-read genome sequencing does not break the genome into small fragments; it sequences longer DNA fragments. Mitochondrial donation treatment uses DNA from the parents and mitochondrial material from a donor, not two mothers and one father. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) accurately describes its nature as DNA fragments found outside cells. Optical tweezers utilize a focused laser beam to manipulate microscopic objects. HeLa cells were indeed the first human cells successfully cloned. Therefore, only 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Concept/Technology              Description/Application
1.  Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)           :   Mixture of antibodies from different B cell lineages
2.  Inverse Vaccine (IV)                     :   Primes immune system to fight pathogens

5.  Macrophages                              :   First line of defense against infection, a type of white blood cell


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are not a mixture of antibodies; they are clones of a single antibody. Inverse vaccines do not prime the immune system to fight pathogens; they retrain it to ignore specific molecules. Cervavac is accurately described as a quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Nuclear medicine correctly uses radioactive tracers. Macrophages are accurately described as the first line of defense and a type of white blood cell. Therefore, options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs, particularly concerning mAbs and inverse vaccines.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

  Topic                                      Related Concept/Initiative
1.  Food Fortification                       :   Biofortification is a post-harvest method
2.  Generic Medicines                       :   Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)
3.  Trans-fats                               :   Naturally occurring trans-fats are unsafe
4.  International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) :   Includes only conventional medicine conditions
5.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)    :   Sets mandatory food standards for all countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biofortification is not a post-harvest method; it is a breeding process.  The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) is indeed related to generic medicines. Naturally occurring trans-fats are safe; industrially produced ones are harmful.  ICD-11 includes traditional medicine conditions. Codex Alimentarius standards are voluntary, not mandatory for all countries. Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Web Technology                            Characteristic
1. Web 1.0                                  :   Interactive and collaborative features

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Web 1.0 was primarily static; Web 2.0 introduced interactive and collaborative features. Web 3.0 is characterized by decentralized transactions, not Web 2.0. Web 4.0 (Symbiotic Web) aims at human-machine symbiosis. Web 5.0 focuses on personal data control and decentralized platforms, not Web 4.0. Therefore, only options 4 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Substance                        Property/Application

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Graphene is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Calcium-41 has a half-life of 99,400 years, not 5,700 years (that's Carbon-14). White phosphorus is used in some munitions and is an incendiary agent, not a chemical weapon under the CWC. Tantalum has a very high melting point and is highly corrosion-resistant. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used for enhanced oil recovery. Therefore, only option 5 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dhanush is a long-range artillery gun, not short-range. Cluster bombs carry many smaller bomblets. Neerakshi AUV is accurately described. Varunastra has a long range, not limited. Thermobaric bombs create a large blast wave and vacuum.  Therefore, only 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the mismatched characteristics of Dhanush, cluster bombs and Varunastra torpedo.

   Technique                                 Application
1. CRISPR/Cas9 technology                 :   Reducing pungency in mustard
2. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)           :   Developing pest-resistant Bt cotton
3. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) :  Sequencing the human Y-chromosome

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to reduce the pungency of mustard by lowering glucosinolate levels, as explicitly stated in the provided text.  This makes option 1 correct.  Options 2 and 3 are incorrect. While ZFNs and TALENs are indeed genome editing techniques, there's no mention in the provided text of their use in developing pest-resistant Bt cotton or in sequencing the human Y-chromosome. The text highlights the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for mustard modification and long-read sequencing for the Y-chromosome.  Therefore, only pair 1 is accurately matched.  The other pairs represent plausible distractors, associating known genome editing techniques with relevant biotechnological applications, but without factual basis in the given context. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between correct and plausible but incorrect applications of specific genome editing techniques.


**2. With reference to  Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                           Characteristic
1. Lead-Acid (PbA) battery                :   High energy density
2. Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery           :   Short lifespan (400-500 cycles)
3. Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery          :   Used in electric automobiles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  Lead-acid batteries are known for their relatively low energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are renowned for their long lifespan, exceeding 5000 cycles, significantly more than the 400-500 cycles mentioned. While lithium manganese oxide is used in electric automobiles, the text does not specifically state that sodium-sulfur batteries are used in this application.  The question tests factual knowledge about different battery types and their properties. The incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, tempting candidates to make assumptions based on general knowledge about battery technologies rather than requiring precise recall of information from the text.


**3. With reference to  Food Fortification, consider the following pairs:**

   Nutrient                                 Food Fortified
1. Iron                                     :   Normal Rice (Custom Milled Rice)
2. Vitamin B9 (folic acid)                 :   Fortified Rice Kernels (FRKs)
3. Vitamin B12 (Cynocobalamine)           :   White Bread

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that fortified rice kernels (FRKs) are fortified with iron, folic acid (Vitamin B9), and cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12). This makes pairs 1 and 2 correct.  While vitamin B12 is a common fortificant in various foods, the provided text doesn't specify white bread as a recipient of this fortification. The question tests the ability to recall specific micronutrients used in a particular food fortification program. The inclusion of “White Bread” as a distractor tests the examinee's understanding of the broader context of food fortification but requires precise knowledge about the specific example discussed in the text.


**4. With reference to  Artificial Intelligence (AI), consider the following pairs:**

   AI Type                                   Example
1. Generative AI                             :   Krutrim
2. Multimodal AI                             :   ChatGPT
3. Frontier AI                               :   Image recognition software

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly names Krutrim as an example of a generative AI model developed in India. This makes option 1 correct. ChatGPT, while a powerful AI model, is primarily a large language model and is categorized as generative AI, not multimodal AI.  Image recognition software utilizes AI but doesn't solely define a specific AI type; it can be implemented using various AI approaches, including deep learning and convolutional neural networks.  The question tests knowledge of different AI categories and their applications. The distractors aim to confuse candidates by associating AI models with functions they may perform but do not strictly define their AI type.

1. Qubit                                     :   Represents 0 and 1 simultaneously
2. Quantum Coherence                       :   Ability of a quantum system to maintain a well-defined quantum state over time
3. Quantum Supremacy                       :   Dominance of a classical computer over a quantum computer

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text defines a qubit as representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously, which is a core concept of quantum computing.  It also correctly describes quantum coherence as the ability of a quantum system to maintain a specific state over time. However, the description of quantum supremacy is incorrect.  Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer's ability to outperform classical computers, not the other way around.  The question tests understanding of fundamental quantum computing concepts. The incorrect option regarding quantum supremacy serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of this key term.


**6. With reference to  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                  Description
1. Size                                      :   Larger than conventional nuclear reactors
2. Modularity                               :   Factory-assembled components for easy transport
3. Refueling Interval                       :   Every one to two years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the statement about modularity is correct. SMRs are designed to be smaller and their components are factory-assembled for easier transport and installation.

(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries indeed utilize ether as a common electrolyte.  Gravity batteries function by lifting and lowering heavy weights, converting potential energy to kinetic energy and then generating electricity through a motor. This makes pair 4 correct.  Sodium-ion batteries, as their name suggests, use sodium ions as charge carriers for energy storage, making pair 5 correct.

Pair 2 is incorrect; SMRs utilize gas (often helium) for cooling, not pressurized water, which is characteristic of older reactor designs.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; ACC batteries can store energy both electrochemically and chemically depending on their design and configuration. Thus, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include pairs that involve inaccurate or incomplete descriptions of the technologies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology               Associated Characteristic
1.  Nuclear Fusion                     :   Overcomes Coulomb Barrier with minimal energy input
2.  Tokamak                            :   Operates on principles different from those powering the Sun
3.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)             :   Fusion process consumes more energy than it produces
4.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses enriched uranium as fuel
5.  Molybdenum-99 production          :  Parent isotope of Technetium-99m


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect; overcoming the Coulomb Barrier in nuclear fusion requires a massive energy input, far exceeding the energy generated in current fusion reactions. Pair 2 is also incorrect; tokamaks operate on the same fundamental principles as the Sun and stars—magnetic confinement of plasma for fusion. Pair 3 is incorrect; NEG signifies that the fusion process generates *more* energy than it consumes, a critical milestone for commercial viability. Pair 4 is incorrect; PHWRs utilize natural uranium, not enriched uranium, as fuel. Therefore, only option (d) accurately reflects the correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technology                Description/Application
1.  Optical Levitation                 :   Requires additional support to hold the object

(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched. Optical levitation, by definition, does *not* require additional support. Deepfakes utilize various AI techniques beyond just deep learning, including GANs and variational autoencoders. Web 3.0 explicitly aims to eliminate intermediaries, contrasting with the statement in the pair. Quantum supremacy demonstrates a *quantum* computer's dominance over classical computers, not the other way around. Finally, the biodegradable paper supercapacitor, while primarily using seaweed, might incorporate other materials in its construction.  Hence, none of the given pairs are correctly matched.

2. Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery   :   Low self-discharge rate
3. Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery       :   High energy density
4. Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery     :   Used in electric automobiles


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries are known for their high energy density, making them suitable for various applications, including portable electronics and electric vehicles.  Nickel-Cadmium batteries exhibit a low self-discharge rate, meaning they retain their charge for extended periods even when not in use.  Lead-acid batteries, while widely used, typically have a much shorter lifespan compared to lithium-ion, with significantly fewer charge-discharge cycles (around 400-500, not 5000+).  Lithium manganese oxide, not Sodium-Sulfur batteries, is a common cathode material in electric automobiles. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Type                 Feature
1. Fourth-generation nuclear reactor :   Uses pressurized water for cooling
2. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)       :   Physically a fraction of the size of a conventional reactor
3. Conventional nuclear power reactor :   Longer refueling interval (3-7 years)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed to be significantly smaller than conventional nuclear power reactors, a key feature differentiating them.  Fourth-generation reactors, while innovative,  typically utilize gas (like helium) for cooling, not pressurized water, which is a characteristic of many conventional designs. The longer refueling interval (3-7 years) is a significant advantage of SMRs, not a feature of conventional reactors which usually require refueling every 1-2 years. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Battery                     Application
1.  Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery :  Stores energy as chemical energy only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Web 2.0 is characterized by its centralized nature and reliance on intermediaries like social media platforms. Web 3.0, in contrast, aims for decentralization, enabling direct peer-to-peer interactions and transactions. Web 1.0, the static web, primarily focused on providing information access, not interactive platforms like Facebook which are a hallmark of Web 2.0.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cryptocurrency Concept              Description
1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)                 :   Delegates network control to token owners

3.  Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)   :  Regulates NFTs and DeFi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) utilize algorithms to validate cryptocurrency transactions and maintain blockchain security.  However, PoW is known for its energy-intensive mining process, while PoS aims to reduce energy consumption by delegating validation responsibilities. MiCA focuses on regulating crypto-asset service providers and consumer protection, but it specifically excludes NFTs and DeFi from its scope. Thus, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   3D Printing Concept                  Description
1. Extrusion-based metal AM           :   Always more cost-effective than other metal 3D printing methods
2. 4D printing                         :  Objects change shape post-production
3. Additive Manufacturing              :   Opposite of subtractive manufacturing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

4D printing involves creating objects that change shape after printing, often in response to external stimuli. Additive manufacturing, the broader term encompassing various 3D printing methods, is indeed the opposite of traditional subtractive manufacturing, which involves removing material to create a shape.  While extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing can be cost-effective, it's not *always* more so than other methods; the cost-effectiveness depends on various factors such as material, complexity, and scale. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 6 does offer backward compatibility, allowing it to connect with devices using older Wi-Fi standards.  Wi-Fi 7, based on the IEEE 802.11be standard, is indeed an Extremely High Throughput (EHT) technology. Wi-Fi 7 is four times faster than Wi-Fi 6, not Wi-Fi 5. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   AI Concept                           Description

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on Aditya-L1 is designed to study the dynamics of the Sun's upper atmosphere.  The Visible Emission Line Coronograph (VELC) is used to observe the solar corona,  and the Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya (PAPA) measures the properties of the solar wind. The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) does not observe the solar disk in near UV band; it is the function of VELC. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**11. Consider the following pairs:**

  Disease                                    Transmission Method
1. Chikungunya                              :   Contact with infected poultry

(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Macrophages are indeed a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. Senescent cells are cells that have stopped dividing but do not undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), accumulating in tissues and potentially contributing to age-related diseases. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, not cells that make cartilage; chondrocytes are the cells that make cartilage. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**13. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology                     Description
1. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)         :   Produced by homogeneous hybrid cells
2. Optical Tweezers                     :   Use a highly focused laser beam to hold microscopic objects

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Quantum Mission (NQM) aims to develop quantum computing capabilities, including intermediate-scale quantum computers with a range of 50-1000 physical qubits.  Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses various methods beyond deep learning, including machine learning, natural language processing, and more. Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system, not a centralized database. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lunar Feature                      Characteristic
1. Lunar Regolith                    : Primarily composed of basalt
2. Agglutinates                      : Volcanic glass formed during impacts
3. Chandrayaan-3 Propulsion Module: Successfully orbited Mars
4.  Chandrayaan-2                    : First successful soft landing on the Moon

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lunar regolith is the layer of unconsolidated, powdery, dusty surface material that covers the Moon. While it contains various components including rock chips, mineral fragments, impact and volcanic glasses, and agglutinates, it is not primarily composed of basalt. Basalt is a common rock type found on the Moon, particularly in the maria (dark, basaltic plains), but it's not the defining characteristic of the entire regolith. Agglutinates are indeed a unique component of lunar regolith, formed by the welding together of fine-grained materials during impacts.  The Chandrayaan-3 Propulsion Module successfully returned from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit, not Mars orbit. This was a significant achievement, demonstrating a gravity assist flyby. Chandrayaan-2 did not achieve a soft landing; its lander crashed.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Chandrayaan missions, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission                         Finding
1. Chandrayaan-1                 : Detected significant quantities of water ice at the lunar south pole
2. Chandrayaan-2                 : Confirmed the presence of Argon-40 in the lunar exosphere
3. Chandrayaan-3                 : Successfully deployed a rover named "Pragyan"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1 detected water in vapor form and evidence suggesting water ice in the polar regions, but not significant quantities of water ice at the south pole. This discovery was later corroborated and expanded upon by subsequent missions. Chandrayaan-2 did detect the hydroxyl radical (OH) and the water molecule (H2O) separately, along with observations related to the distribution of Argon-40 in the lunar exosphere.  Chandrayaan-3 successfully deployed the Pragyan rover. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lunar Feature                     Description
1. Shiv Shakti Point                :  Crash site of Chandrayaan-2 lander
2. Tiranga Point                    :  Landing site of Chandrayaan-3 lander
3. Lunar South Pole                : Easier to land on than the lunar equator due to smoother terrain
4. Permanently shadowed craters   : Estimated to hold water ice

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Shiv Shakti Point is the successful landing site of Chandrayaan-3, not the crash site of Chandrayaan-2. Tiranga Point is indeed the designated name for the crash site of Chandrayaan-2's lander. The lunar south pole is considered more challenging to land on than the lunar equator due to its rough terrain, permanently shadowed craters, and extreme temperature variations. However, permanently shadowed craters are indeed estimated to hold significant quantities of water ice, making them areas of great scientific interest for future exploration.


**4. With reference to the Moon, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                              Definition
1. Tidal Locking                     :  One side of the Moon always faces away from the Earth
2. Lunar Day                          : Approximately 29.5 Earth days
3. Near Side of the Moon            :  Rougher terrain with more craters than the far side
4. Far Side of the Moon              : Only successfully landed on by China's Chang'e-4

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Tidal locking refers to the synchronization of the Moon's rotation around its axis and its orbit around Earth, resulting in one side always facing the Earth. A lunar day is indeed approximately 29.5 Earth days. The near side of the Moon is relatively smoother with large volcanic plains, while the far side is characterized by a heavily cratered surface.  China's Chang'e-4 mission was indeed the first to successfully land on the far side of the Moon.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Feature                       Description

2. Chromosphere                      : Reaches from the solar surface to about 400 km above
3. Corona                             : Outermost layer, temperature of 500,000 K or more
4. Coronal Holes                      : Cooler, less dense regions appearing dark in EUV images

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The photosphere's temperature ranges from about 6500 K at the bottom to 4000 K at the top. The chromosphere lies between the photosphere and the corona and does not reach to 400 km above the solar surface. The corona is the outermost layer of the Sun, with temperatures reaching 500,000 K or more. Coronal holes are indeed cooler, less dense regions that appear dark in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft x-ray solar images.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Criticality in a nuclear reactor refers to the condition where a self-sustaining chain reaction is achieved. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) use natural uranium, not enriched uranium. The CE-20 cryogenic engine uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, not kerosene. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed to be smaller and modular than conventional reactors. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**9. With reference to alternative energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                         Description

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) utilize various electrochemical reactions to store energy. Li-ion batteries use liquid electrolytes, not solid electrolytes (solid-state batteries use solid electrolytes). Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) use nuclear fission, not fusion, for power generation. V2G charging allows for bidirectional energy flow between electric vehicles and the power grid. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nanotechnology Term                Description
1.  Nanohybrids                       :  Materials with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm
2.  Graphene                          :  Allotrope of carbon with exceptional electrical conductivity
3.  Optical Tweezers                  :  Use focused laser beams to manipulate microscopic objects
4.  White Phosphorus                 :  Used in fertilizers and cleaning compounds

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nanohybrids are a combination of at least two different nanoparticles, not materials with sizes from 1 to 100 nm. Graphene is an allotrope of carbon and is known for its excellent electrical conductivity. Optical tweezers utilize focused laser beams to trap and manipulate microscopic particles. White phosphorus is primarily used in military applications as an incendiary agent, not as a component in fertilizers or cleaning compounds. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Solar Layer                     Characteristic Temperature Range
1. Photosphere                 : 4000 K - 8000 K
2. Chromosphere                : 6500 K - 4000 K
3. Transition Region           : 8000 K - 500,000 K
4. Corona                      : 500,000 K or more, up to a few million K

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the temperature ranges of the Transition Region and Corona, respectively.  The photosphere's temperature range is approximately 6500 K at the bottom to 4000 K at the top, making option 1 incorrect. The chromosphere's temperature varies from about 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top, reversing the values presented in option 2.  The Transition Region exhibits a sharp temperature increase from approximately 8000 K to 500,000 K, and the Corona's temperature extends to millions of Kelvin, as stated correctly in option (b). Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair. Option (c) incorrectly pairs the chromosphere and transition region. Option (d) includes the incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 2.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Solar Phenomenon              Description
1. Sunspots                    : Areas of extremely strong magnetic fields in the corona
2. Coronal Holes                : Cooler, less dense regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields in the photosphere
3. Solar Prominences           : Large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface into the chromosphere
4. Solar Flares                 : Giant explosions associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the description of solar flares is entirely accurate. Solar flares are indeed giant explosions on the Sun that release energy, light, and high-speed particles into space, frequently associated with CMEs.  Option 1 is incorrect because sunspots form in the photosphere, not the corona, and are characterized by intense magnetic fields, not necessarily "extremely strong" in comparison to other solar phenomena. Option 2 is incorrect because coronal holes are found in the corona, not the photosphere.  Option 3 is incorrect as prominences extend into the corona, not the chromosphere. Option (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Solar Feature                  Characteristic
1. Photosphere                 : Outermost layer of the Sun
2. Chromosphere                : Layer between photosphere and corona
3. Corona                      : Visible only during a total solar eclipse or with a coronagraph

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 2 and 3 accurately describe the chromosphere and corona. The chromosphere is indeed the layer between the photosphere and corona, and the corona is only directly visible during a total solar eclipse or with the use of a coronagraph.  Option 1 is incorrect as the photosphere is the deepest layer of the Sun directly observable, not the outermost.  Option (a) and (c) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs. Option (d) includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.


**4. With reference to the Gaganyaan mission, consider the following pairs:**

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) as pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Gaganyaan mission utilizes the LVM3 launch vehicle, and the CE-20 cryogenic engine does indeed use a combination of refined kerosene and liquid oxygen.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the ECLSS was indigenously developed by ISRO, not NASA. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 2.


**5. With reference to NavIC, consider the following pairs:**

Feature                          Characteristic
1. Number of Satellites           : 7 (3 geostationary, 4 inclined geosynchronous)
2. Coverage Area                 :  Entire Indian landmass and up to 1,500 km beyond its boundaries
3. Services Offered              : Standard Position Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. NavIC indeed comprises 7 satellites (3 geostationary and 4 inclined geosynchronous), provides coverage across India and extends up to 1500 km beyond its borders, and offers both Standard Position Service (SPS) for civilian use and Restricted Service (RS) for strategic purposes.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

**1. With reference to Chandrayaan missions, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission                      Key Finding
1. Chandrayaan-1             :   Detected water ice in the North polar region of the Moon
2. Chandrayaan-2             :   Detected hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately
3. Chandrayaan-3             :   Successfully returned the Propulsion Module from lunar orbit to Earth's orbit

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument provided strong evidence for the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters near the Moon's north pole.  This was a significant finding, confirming the existence of water in a form previously unknown on the Moon. Chandrayaan-2, while its lander mission unfortunately failed, its orbiter continued to function, making significant contributions to lunar science.  Its observations confirmed the presence of both hydroxyl (OH) and water (H2O) molecules separately, providing further insights into the lunar water cycle. Chandrayaan-3 achieved a remarkable feat by successfully demonstrating the retrieval of the Propulsion Module from lunar orbit back to Earth's orbit, a first-of-its-kind maneuver in space exploration, showcasing India’s advanced space technology capabilities.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the challenges of lunar soft landing, consider the following pairs:**

   Challenge                         Mitigation Strategy in Chandrayaan-3
1. Difficult terrain                 :   Increased landing velocity from 2 m/sec to 3 m/sec
2. Distance from propulsion module :   Larger landing site (four km by 2.5 km)
3. Lunar dust                      :   Improved thrusters (four instead of five)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 addressed the challenge of unpredictable lunar terrain by increasing the landing velocity to 3 m/sec, allowing for a more robust and adaptable descent. This enhanced the lander's ability to handle unexpected surface variations. The mission also significantly expanded the landing site from the previous 500m x 500m to a much larger area of four km by 2.5 km, thus increasing the chances of a successful landing in a safe zone. While Chandrayaan-3 did incorporate improvements to its thrusters, reducing the number from five to four, this was primarily focused on efficiency and reliability, not directly addressing lunar dust mitigation.  Lunar dust mitigation strategies primarily focused on robust camera systems and software designed to filter out dust-induced errors. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs related to Aditya-L1's payloads:**

   Payload Type                     Specific Payload
1. Remote sensing                 :   Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment (ASPEX)
2. In-situ                           :   Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT)
3. Remote sensing                 :   Plasma Analyser Package For Aditya (PAPA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1 carries a suite of remote sensing and in-situ payloads.  The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is a remote sensing instrument designed to capture images of the Sun's ultraviolet emissions.  ASPEX and PAPA are both in-situ payloads, meaning they directly measure the properties of the solar wind and plasma environment near the L1 Lagrange point.  The  Plasma Analyser Package For Aditya (PAPA) is an in-situ instrument. Thus, only the pair linking SUIT to remote sensing is correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly assign payload types.


**4. With reference to the Gaganyaan mission, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                      Description

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gaganyaan mission will utilize the LVM3 launch vehicle, a powerful rocket developed by ISRO. The ECLSS is indeed an indigenously developed system by ISRO, not a private company. The CE-20 cryogenic engine uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, not refined kerosene. Therefore, only the pair linking the launch vehicle to LVM3 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to NavIC:**

   Feature                          Description
1. Number of Satellites             :   7 (3 geostationary, 4 inclined geosynchronous)
2. Coverage Area                   :   Entire Indian landmass and up to 1,500 km beyond
3. Positioning Accuracy            :   10 meters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

NavIC comprises a constellation of seven satellites—three in geostationary orbit and four in inclined geosynchronous orbit.  Its coverage extends across the entire Indian landmass and reaches up to 1,500 km beyond its borders.  NavIC offers a positioning accuracy of approximately 10 meters, superior to the accuracy of some other global navigation systems.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to Gravitational Waves, consider the following pairs:**

   Wave Characteristic             Source
1. Higher frequency                 :   Merging supermassive black holes
2. Lower frequency                 :   Smaller pairs of black holes
3. Detection method                :   Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1,2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Higher-frequency gravitational waves are typically generated by smaller, less massive objects like smaller pairs of black holes.  Lower-frequency gravitational waves are associated with more massive events, such as the merging of supermassive black holes.  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a crucial instrument for detecting gravitational waves, having made groundbreaking observations.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs related to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):**

   Finding                           Description
1. Discovery of fully formed galaxies :   Earlier than predicted by the standard cosmological model
2. Galaxy brightness                 :   Directly proportional to mass in all cases
3. Star formation                   :   Identical process in early and present-day galaxies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

JWST observations have revealed the existence of fully formed galaxies much earlier in the universe's history than predicted by the standard cosmological model, challenging our understanding of galaxy formation. The relationship between galaxy brightness and mass is more nuanced than a simple direct proportionality; JWST findings have shown that less massive galaxies can exhibit surprisingly high brightness.  Star formation processes have been shown to differ significantly between the early universe and the present day. Thus, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the components of Lunar Regolith, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                       Description
1. Rock chips                       :   Exclusively found on the Moon
2. Mineral fragments                :   Sharp with fresh fractured surfaces
3. Agglutinates                     :   A peculiar component only found on the Moon

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lunar regolith is composed of various components, including rock chips, mineral fragments, impact and volcanic glasses. Agglutinates are indeed a unique component found only on the Moon, formed by the welding together of smaller particles by micrometeorite impacts.  While soil grains can have sharp, fresh surfaces, it's not an exclusive characteristic of lunar regolith. Rock chips are not exclusively found on the Moon, they are found on other planetary bodies as well.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs regarding the layers of the Sun:**

   Layer                            Temperature Characteristic
1. Photosphere                    :   Temperature varies between 4000 K and 8000 K
2. Chromosphere                   :   Temperature rises abruptly from about 8000 to 500,000 K
3. Transition Region               :   Temperature is 500,000 K or more

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The photosphere's temperature varies between approximately 6500 K at the bottom and 4000 K at the top. The chromosphere's temperature ranges from about 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top.  The transition region is characterized by a dramatic temperature increase, from roughly 8000 K to 500,000 K. The corona has temperatures of 500,000 K or more.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the different types of Black Holes, consider the following pairs:**

   Black Hole Type                   Mass Characteristic
1. Primordial Black Holes          :   Hundreds of thousands of times the Sun's mass
2. Stellar Black Holes              :   Around one hundred to hundreds of thousands of times the Sun's mass
3. Supermassive Black Holes        :   Formed from the collapse of a large star

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Primordial black holes are hypothesized to have formed in the early universe and are expected to have relatively small masses. Stellar black holes form from the collapse of massive stars, typically ranging from a few to tens of solar masses. Supermassive black holes reside at the centers of galaxies and possess masses millions or even billions of times that of the Sun. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Initiative                     Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana : Ministry of Health & Family Welfare
2. National Ayush Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMSTE) portal : Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers
3. Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals : Department of Biotechnology
4.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) : Ministry of New and Renewable Energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched in 2008 by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, not the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.  The National Ayush Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Electronic (NAMSTE) portal falls under the purview of the Ministry of Ayush, which works towards promoting traditional medicine systems, including Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Pharmaceuticals is indeed implemented by the Department of Biotechnology, aiming to boost domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing.  Finally, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) operates independently under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to  Food Fortification, consider the following pairs:**

   Micronutrient                                      Source/Initiative
1. Vitamin B9 (folic acid)                               : Saksham Anganwadi
2. Vitamin B12 (Cynocobalamine)                       : Centrally sponsored pilot scheme on “Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System
3. Iron                                                  : Biofortification
4.  Iron, Folic Acid, Vitamin B12                      :  Custom Milled Rice


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Vitamin B9 (folic acid) and Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) are micronutrients added during rice fortification under various schemes including Saksham Anganwadi and the centrally sponsored pilot scheme, the question plays on the specifics.  Iron is a micronutrient added to rice, but biofortification is a distinct process of breeding nutrients into crops themselves, not adding them post-harvest.  The combination of Iron, Folic Acid, and Vitamin B12 is specifically added to custom-milled rice to create fortified rice kernels (FRKs). Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the source/initiative of specific micronutrients in the context of food fortification.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Fat                                  Characteristic/Source
1. Industrially-produced trans fat           : Occurs naturally in some dairy and meat products
2. Naturally-occurring trans fats            : Formed during hydrogenation of vegetable oil
3. Saturated fats                              : Increase LDL (“bad” cholesterol) levels
4.  Unsaturated fats                           : Primarily found in foods from animals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Industrially-produced trans fats are formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, not naturally occurring in dairy and meat.  Naturally occurring trans fats are indeed found in some dairy and meat products. Saturated fats are correctly paired with their effect on increasing LDL cholesterol levels.

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the blockchain by requiring computational work.  Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism where the right to create new blocks and validate transactions is assigned to users proportionally to the number of tokens they hold.  A stablecoin maintains a relatively stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, unlike the description provided in option 3. Security tokens represent ownership in a real-world asset, making option 4 correct. Utility tokens provide access to a product or service, not a fixed value as stated in option 5. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d)  contain incorrect pairings, highlighting common misconceptions about PoW, PoS, stablecoins, and utility tokens. Option (b) incorrectly assigns characteristics of PoS to PoW and mischaracterizes stablecoins and utility tokens. Option (c) overlooks the correct matching of security tokens. Option (d) incorrectly links the description of PoS to PoW.

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries indeed utilize ether as an electrolyte, a key component in their electrochemical operation.  Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries due to the lower cost and abundant availability of sodium.  However, the statement about Lead-Acid batteries having 5000+ charge-discharge cycles is incorrect. Lead-acid batteries typically have a significantly shorter lifespan, with 400-500 cycles being more representative, whereas Lithium-ion batteries offer a much higher number of cycles (5000+).  Option (a) is incorrect because only the second pair is correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes the second pair, neglecting the accurate third pair. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the inaccurate first pair.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are indeed characterized by their power generation capacity, typically ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe, making the second pair correct. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are known for using natural uranium as fuel, a defining characteristic of their design. Therefore, the third pair is also correct.  However, the first pair is incorrect. Fourth-generation nuclear reactors utilize gas, such as helium, for cooling, unlike conventional power plants that employ pressurized water. Option (a) is incorrect as only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched second pair. Option (d) is incorrect because the first pair is factually wrong.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

2. ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) :   A type of genetic engineering technique
3. TALENs (Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases):  Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

TALENs (Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases) are indeed a type of gene editing technology that modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns by precisely targeting and modifying DNA sequences.  The statement that CRISPR uses zinc finger nucleases is incorrect; CRISPR utilizes a different mechanism involving guide RNA to target specific DNA sequences for editing.  While ZFNs are gene editing techniques, the description stating they are a type of genetic engineering is true but not uniquely descriptive.  The other options are incorrect because only the third pair accurately reflects the described technique and its function.  Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because they include inaccurate pairs. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason, along with incorrectly including the first pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                           Transmission Method
1. Chikungunya                     :   Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is correctly paired with its transmission vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is accurately linked to its transmission through blood-feeding insects, including flies and mosquitoes.  However, Zika virus transmission is primarily through Aedes mosquitoes, not predominantly blood transfusions. While blood transfusions can be a route of transmission, it's not the primary mode.  The other options are incorrect because only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched, reflecting the primary transmission routes of these diseases. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the second pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                       Application

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a crucial technique used in radiometric dating, specifically for isotopes like Calcium-41, making the third pair accurate.  Optical tweezers are used to manipulate microscopic objects, but their application is not directly related to the study of electron dynamics in matter; attosecond pulses of light are used for this purpose.  Quantum dots have numerous applications but are not used in pencils and lubricants; graphite is the primary component used in these items. The other options are incorrect because only the third pair correctly links the technology to its application.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include either the first or second pair or both.

3.  Tokamak                         :   Magnetic fusion device designed to tap into the potential of fusion energy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A tokamak is indeed a magnetic fusion device designed to harness the energy potential of nuclear fusion reactions, making the third pair correct.  The first pair is incorrect; while nuclear fusion does overcome the Coulomb barrier, the energy currently required to initiate fusion exceeds the energy generated.  The second pair is also incorrect; Net Energy Gain (NEG) signifies that the fusion process generates more energy than it consumes, the opposite of what's stated. The other options are incorrect because only the third pair accurately describes the technology. Options (a), (c), and (d) include inaccurate pairs 1 and/or 2.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                         Property

3. White Phosphorus                :   Used in fertilizers and food additives

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tantalum is correctly paired with its high corrosion resistance, a key characteristic that makes it suitable for various applications. White phosphorus does find use in fertilizers and some cleaning compounds, though its use in food additives is less common and more controversial.  However, the statement about graphene having a low surface area is incorrect; graphene possesses an exceptionally high surface area, a crucial property for many of its applications.  The other options are incorrect because only the second and third pairs accurately reflect the properties of the materials. Options (a), (b), and (d) either incorrectly include the first pair or omit the correctly matched second and third pairs.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology               Application

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is accurately paired with its application in treating congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP). HeLa cells were indeed the first human cells to be successfully cloned, making the third pair correct.  However, the statement about monoclonal antibodies being produced by extracting antibodies from animal blood is largely incorrect. While some monoclonal antibodies may use animal cells in the production process, the core principle involves creating hybridomas of human B cells to produce identical antibodies. The other options are incorrect because only the first and third pairs are accurately matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include the second pair which is inaccurate.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

  Food Additive/Substance       Characteristic
1. Trans fats                     :   Naturally occurring trans fats are unsafe

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The statement about trans fats is incorrect; naturally occurring trans fats, found in some dairy and meat products, are generally considered safe.  The statement about non-sugar sweeteners is also incorrect; while many NSS have few or no calories, some may contain a small amount.  The claim about protein binders being used in dairy product manufacturing is incorrect;  the use of protein binders in dairy products is generally not permitted.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly claim at least one pair to be correct.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                 Function
1. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC): Sets mandatory food standards for all member countries
2. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI): Operationalizes provisions of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is accurately described as the organization that operationalizes the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.  The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) sets voluntary, not mandatory, international food standards. NOTTO's function is related to organ and tissue transplantation, not the regulation of generic medicines. The other options are incorrect because only the second pair correctly matches the organization to its function. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include either the first or third pair or both.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Editing Technique                     Description
1. CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) : Modifies existing genetic material to improve quality
2. Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs)             : Involves genes of foreign origin
3. Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs)      : Does not involve alien genetic material

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR technology is a gene editing technique that modifies existing genetic material within an organism's genome.  It doesn't introduce foreign genes; instead, it precisely alters existing genes. This is a key distinction from genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  Both ZFNs and TALENs are also gene editing tools, but unlike CRISPR, they are less precise and more complex.  Crucially, SDN1 and SDN2, categories of gene editing, do not involve alien genetic material, and the resulting crops are indistinguishable from conventionally bred ones.  SDN3, however, does utilize foreign genes.  Therefore, only pair 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect because the description provided is characteristic of SDN3, not ZFNs specifically.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetically Modified Crop                    Characteristic
1. Bt Cotton                                 : Contains genes from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
2. Bt Brinjal                               : Approved for commercial cultivation in India
3. GM Mustard (DMH-11)                     : Result of a cross between Varuna and Early Heera-2

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bt cotton contains genes from the soil bacterium *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt), which produce proteins toxic to bollworm pests.  Bt brinjal, while developed, was not approved for commercial cultivation in India due to concerns regarding its impact on health and the environment.  GM Mustard (DMH-11) is indeed a transgenic crop resulting from a cross between Varuna and Early Heera-2 varieties, incorporating foreign genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is factually incorrect about the commercial approval status of Bt Brinjal.

3. Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) sequencing : Sequences the entire human genome

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Short-read sequencing breaks the genome into small fragments for sequencing, making it ideal for applications like counting specific sequences or profiling gene expression, but not for easily distinguishing sequences. Long-read sequencing, conversely, generates longer sequences, which are more challenging to assemble due to repetitive elements but are better for distinguishing sequences.  The Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium successfully sequenced the entire human genome in 2022, achieving 100% coverage compared to the Human Genome Project's 92%. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The descriptions for short-read and long-read sequencing are reversed in pairs 1 and 2.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                    Application

2. Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) technology : Reducing mosquito populations
3.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)          : Radiometric dating using Calcium-41

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gene-drive technology aims to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, and has shown promise in controlling populations of disease vectors like mosquitoes.  CRNS technology is a nuclear technique used for measuring soil moisture and optimizing fertilizer use. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used in radiometric dating, particularly with long-lived isotopes like Calcium-41.  Only pair 3 accurately reflects the application of the technology.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is a treatment where replacement enzymes are given to patients with enzyme deficiencies.  Adzynma, approved by the USFDA, is an example used for cTTP. Hybridoma technology is used to produce monoclonal antibodies, not polyclonal antibodies. Optical tweezers use focused laser beams to manipulate microscopic objects, and have been applied to studying materials like Laponite. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 incorrectly describes the application of hybridoma technology.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus, primarily transmitted from fruit bats to humans, not Aedes mosquitoes. Lumpy skin disease is indeed an infectious viral disease affecting cattle, characterized by fever and skin nodules. Avian influenza A (H9N2) is a subtype of influenza A virus affecting birds and causing rare human infections. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The transmission vector for Nipah virus is incorrectly stated in pair 1.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

1.  Nuclear Fusion                               : Involves combining heavy atomic nuclei
2.  Tokamak                                     : A magnetic fusion device
3.  Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS)   : Treats contaminated water from Fukushima

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Nuclear fusion involves combining light atomic nuclei, not heavy ones, to release energy.  A tokamak is a magnetic confinement device used in nuclear fusion research. The Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) is indeed used to treat contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The description of nuclear fusion in pair 1 is incorrect.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are indeed brief, intense bursts of radio waves from distant galaxies. Blazars are active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes.  A quasi-moon, while sharing a similar orbital period with Earth, is not entirely independent of Earth's gravitational influence.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The description of a quasi-moon's relationship with Earth's gravity in pair 3 is inaccurate.

3. Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) : Free Drugs Service Initiative of National Health Mission (NHM)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched in 2008 by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers to promote generic medicines and make them more accessible to the public. This is a correctly matched pair.  The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme is an initiative by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing in various sectors, including pharmaceuticals.  However, it is not directly under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The Free Drugs Service Initiative is a program under the National Health Mission (NHM), which falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect.  The CDSCO is involved in regulating drugs and pharmaceuticals, but the Free Drugs Service Initiative is a public health program, not directly a CDSCO initiative. Options (b) and (d) are thus incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to  Food Fortification, consider the following pairs:**

   Micronutrient                                Fortification Method

2. Vitamin B9 (folic acid)                     :   Coating
3. Vitamin B12 (Cynocobalamine)             :   Extrusion

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Iron, Vitamin B9 (folic acid), and Vitamin B12 (Cynocobalamine) are all micronutrients added to fortified rice kernels (FRKs).  The methods of fortification include coating, extrusion, and dusting. While the exact ratio of each method used might vary depending on the specific process, all three methods are employed in the fortification of rice with these micronutrients.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  There are no incorrect pairings in the given options.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Social Dialogue Report is published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), making pair 3 correct. The World Malaria Report is released by the World Health Organization (WHO), not the UNODC, making pair 2 incorrect. The Global Report on Trafficking in Persons is published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), not WHO, making pair 1 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.

1. CRISPR/Cas9                               :   Uses site-directed nucleases (SDNs)
2. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)               :   Does not involve alien genetic material (SDN1 & SDN2)
3. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) :  Involves genes of foreign origin (SDN3)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 is a genome editing technique that utilizes site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to modify DNA sequences.  Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are also SDN-based techniques.  However,  SDN1 and SDN2 do not introduce foreign genetic material, while SDN3 does.  Therefore, while pair 1 is correct, pair 3 is incorrect as TALENs can be used in both SDN1&2 and SDN3. Pair 2 is partially correct as ZFNs are SDN-based but the description is too broad. Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, with caveats.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Gaucher's Disease                          :   Genetic condition present at birth
3. Tyrosinemia-Type 1                         :   Rare blood clotting disorder

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gaucher's disease and Tyrosinemia-Type 1 are both genetic conditions present at birth.  While Sickle Cell Disease is also a genetic disorder, Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is not a primary treatment for it; stem cell transplants are.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because the treatment mentioned is not applicable to the disease.


**8. With reference to  Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

1. Fortified rice distribution           :   Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0
2.  Micronutrient limits for FRKs       :   Food Safety and Standards Act 2006
3.  Protein binders in dairy products   :   FSSAI permitted additive

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the distribution of fortified rice under Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, making pair 1 correct.  It also states that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, operationalized provisions imposing limits on micronutrients for the manufacturing of fortified rice kernels (FRKs), validating pair 2. However, pair 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the FSSAI clarified that the addition of protein binders or any other additives in dairy products is *not* permitted. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Sweetener Type                     Characteristic/Source
1.  Aspartame                          :   Methyl ester of a dipeptide
2.  Sucralose                           :   Derived from aceto-acetic acid

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text correctly identifies aspartame as a methyl ester of a dipeptide, making pair 1 accurate.  However, pair 2 is incorrect; sucralose is described as a zero-calorie artificial sweetener made from sugar, while acesulfame-K is derived from aceto-acetic acid. Pair 3 is also incorrect because sucralose, not acesulfame-K, is the zero-calorie artificial sweetener made from sugar. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text defines Gene-drive Technology (GDT) as a genetic engineering technique that modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance, making pair 1 correct. The text also explicitly states that scientists successfully sequenced the Y-chromosome using ‘long-read’ genome sequencing techniques, validating pair 2. However, while CRISPR is a gene editing tool and can be used in site-directed mutagenesis, the text does not explicitly state that CRISPR *is* a type of site-directed mutagenesis.  It mentions CRISPR alongside other gene editing techniques, but doesn't define it solely as a site-directed mutagenesis tool. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are definitively correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude a correctly matched pair or include an incorrectly matched pair.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Fusion Related Entity                     Description
1. Coulomb Barrier                               :   A phenomenon where two positive nuclei repel each other.
2. ITER Project                                   :   Aims to demonstrate Net Energy Gain (NEG) from fusion reactors.
3. JT-60SA                                      :   World's biggest experimental nuclear fusion reactor located in France.
4. Aditya Tokamak                               :   An indigenous tokamak constructed by India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Coulomb Barrier accurately describes the repulsive force between two positively charged atomic nuclei, a key hurdle in achieving nuclear fusion.  The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project is a multinational collaboration explicitly aimed at demonstrating Net Energy Gain (NEG) – producing more energy from fusion than is consumed in the process.  Aditya is indeed an indigenous tokamak developed in India. However, the statement regarding JT-60SA is incorrect. While JT-60SA is a significant experimental fusion reactor, it's located in Japan, not France, and serves as a precursor to ITER, not the other way around.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology Term                       Definition/Description

4.  Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) :   Removes strontium and cesium from contaminated water.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Criticality correctly defines the self-sustaining chain reaction in a nuclear reactor.  Multinucleon transfer accurately describes the exchange of protons and neutrons between isotopes.  The Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) is indeed used to remove radioactive elements, including strontium and cesium, from contaminated water. However, the description of PHWR is incorrect. PHWRs utilize natural uranium, not enriched uranium, as fuel.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Crypto mining accurately describes the process of verifying and securing blockchain transactions.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) correctly represent unique digital assets on a blockchain.  However, blockchain technology is decentralized, not centralized. Proof-of-Work is not a mechanism that delegates control to token owners; that's Proof-of-Stake. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lagrangian Point L1 is indeed a point where a spacecraft can stay with minimal fuel. Aditya-L1 is correctly identified as India's solar observatory mission. A gravity assist flyby accurately describes using a celestial body's gravity for trajectory alteration. However, Chandrayaan-3 landed on the Moon's South Pole, not the North Pole.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material Science Term                       Description

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Superconductivity, the Meissner effect, and Cooper pairs are all correctly defined within the context of superconductivity.  However, achieving room-temperature superconductivity under normal atmospheric pressure remains a significant scientific challenge. While some materials exhibit superconductivity at relatively higher temperatures, true room temperature superconductivity at normal pressure is not yet achieved. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively correctly matched.

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The definition of Rare Earth Elements (REEs) is accurate. Red mud is indeed a byproduct of aluminum production containing REEs. Titanomagnetite is correctly identified as a primary source of vanadium. However, vanadium is not a rare earth element; it's a transition metal.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.

2. Biofortification                           : A post-harvest method of enhancing nutrient content
3.  Food Fortification                        : A pre-harvest method of enhancing nutrient content in crops
4.  Trans Fat (Industrially Produced)     : Unsaturated fat formed during hydrogenation of vegetable oils

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A biosimilar is a medicine very close in structure and function to a biological medicine (made in a living system). Option 1 is incorrect. Biofortification is the process of breeding nutrients into food crops, a pre-harvest method. Option 3 is incorrect. Food fortification is the deliberate increase of micronutrients in food, which is a post-harvest process.  Option 2 is incorrect. Industrially produced trans fats are indeed formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oils. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-1's significant findings included the detection of water in vapor form and the discovery of water ice in the Moon's North polar region.  Additionally, it detected x-ray signals during weak solar flares and confirmed the Ocean Magma Hypothesis.  The detection of Argon-40 in the lunar exosphere is also a key finding attributed to Chandrayaan-1. Chandrayaan-2 aimed for a soft landing, but the lander Vikram crashed. However, the orbiter continued its mission, contributing to scientific objectives such as detecting hydroxyl radical (OH) and water molecule (H2O) separately and finding water signatures at all latitudes.  Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the lunar South Pole. While it made significant contributions to lunar exploration, the specific detection of hydroxyl radical and water molecules separately was already a key finding from Chandrayaan-2. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes Chandrayaan-1's Argon-40 detection, ignoring its other key findings and Chandrayaan-2's achievements. Option (c) is incorrect as it mistakenly attributes the detection of (OH) and (H2O) to Chandrayaan-3, even though this was a finding of Chandrayaan-2. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Chandrayaan-3 with the detection of (OH) and (H2O).


**2. With reference to the challenges of lunar soft landing, consider the following pairs:**

    Challenge                     Specific Aspect

    3. Speed of descent            : Going from 6,000 km/h to zero

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Unexpected terrain changes during a lunar landing can indeed lead to altitude sensor errors or software glitches. The distance between the lander and the propulsion module after separation is accurately described as a 100 km x 30 km orbit, representing the farthest and closest points from the Moon's surface. Finally, the significant speed reduction required for a soft landing—from over 6,000 km/h to zero—is a major challenge due to the absence of an atmosphere on the Moon, which prevents the use of parachutes for significant deceleration. Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all three pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to Aditya-L1's payloads, consider the following pairs:**

    1. Web 1.0                    : Peer-to-peer transactions
    2. Web 3.0                    : Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    3. Web 5.0                    :  Centralized data storage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Web 1.0 was characterized by static web pages and limited user interaction, not peer-to-peer transactions. Web 3.0 incorporates technologies like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and DAOs. Web 5.0 emphasizes decentralized data storage and user control, not centralized storage.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect characterizations of Web 1.0, Web 3.0, and Web 5.0.


**17. With reference to  Radiometric Dating, consider the following pairs:**

    Isotope                     Characteristic
    1. Carbon-14                  : Half-life of 99,400 years
    2. Calcium-41                 :  Can date objects older than 50,000 years
    3. Carbon-12                  : Used in radiometric dating

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Carbon-14 has a half-life of approximately 5,700 years. Calcium-41, with its much longer half-life, has potential for dating older objects than Carbon-14. Carbon-12 is the most abundant isotope of carbon and is not directly used for radiometric dating; the ratio of Carbon-12 to Carbon-14 is used. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect information about the half-life of Carbon-14 and the use of Carbon-12 in radiometric dating.



**1. With reference to Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

   Type of BESS                     Characteristic
1. Standard (non-flow) batteries   :   Uses tanks of electrolyte and membrane
2. Flow batteries                  :   Consists of pairs of plates immersed in electrolyte
3. Redox Flow Battery (RFB)       :   Categorized under electrochemical storage system
4. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery    :   Uses ether as an electrolyte

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Standard (non-flow) batteries are characterized by pairs of plates (electrodes) immersed in an electrolyte, separated by non-conducting materials.  Flow batteries, on the other hand, utilize tanks of electrolyte and a membrane to control electron flow, employing pumps to manage electrolyte movement.  The Redox Flow Battery (RFB) is indeed a type of electrochemical storage system, falling under the broader category of flow batteries.  Finally, Lithium-ion batteries utilize ether, a class of organic compounds, as their electrolyte. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly reverse the characteristics of standard and flow batteries.

   Feature of SMRs                      Description
1.  Physical Size                         :   Harness nuclear fission
2.  Modular Design                       :   Longer refueling interval
3.  Cooling Mechanism                    :   Uses gas (helium) for cooling
4.  Refueling Interval                    :   Systems and components factory-assembled

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are characterized by their compact physical size, a key differentiator from conventional nuclear reactors.  Their modular design allows for factory assembly and transport as units for on-site installation.  The cooling mechanism in fourth-generation SMRs utilizes helium gas, unlike the pressurized water used in traditional plants.  Finally, a significant advantage of SMRs is their extended refueling interval, typically three to seven years compared to the one to two years required for conventional reactors. Thus, only pair 3 accurately reflects a feature of SMRs and its description. The other options incorrectly link features with inappropriate descriptions.


**3. With reference to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                 Role/Characteristic
1.  WHO                                  :   Solely responsible for Codex standards
2.  FAO                                   :   Headquartered in Rome
3.  Codex Alimentarius                    :   Collection of mandatory food standards
4.  CCSCH                                :   Finalizes quality standards for spices

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).  The CAC's headquarters are indeed located in Rome.  The Codex Alimentarius is a compilation of voluntary international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice, not mandatory ones.  The Codex Committee on Spices and Culinary Herbs (CCSCH) plays a crucial role in finalizing quality standards for spices. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 incorrectly attributes sole responsibility for Codex standards to WHO, and pair 3 mischaracterizes Codex standards as mandatory.


**4. With reference to Organ and Tissue Transplantation, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Transplant                     Description
1. Autograft                            :   Transplant from a non-human animal source
2. Xenotransplantation                  :   Transplant of tissues within the same person
3. Kidney Transplant                     :   Can be donated by living donors
4. Tissue Transplantation              :   Involves corneas, skin, bone, etc.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Autografts involve transplanting tissues or organs within the same individual, not from a non-human animal source as stated in pair 1. Xenotransplantation, by definition, is the transplantation of non-human tissues or organs into human recipients, making pair 2 incorrect.  Kidney transplants are indeed possible from living donors, making pair 3 correct. Tissue transplantation does encompass corneas, skin, bone, heart valves, and blood vessels, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are accurately matched.  The other options contain incorrect pairings based on definitions of transplant types.


**5. With reference to Li-ion Batteries, consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Component                    Function/Characteristic
1.  Lithium cobalt oxide                :   Electrolyte
2.  Ether                               :   Cathode material
3.  Solid-state lithium battery          :   Uses liquid electrolyte
4.  Lithium manganese oxide             :   Used in electric automobiles

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lithium cobalt oxide serves as a cathode material in Li-ion batteries, not as an electrolyte.  Ether acts as an electrolyte, not a cathode material.  Solid-state lithium batteries, unlike conventional Li-ion batteries, utilize solid electrolytes, not liquid ones. Lithium manganese oxide is indeed used as a cathode material in electric automobiles. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly pair materials/components with their functions/characteristics in Li-ion battery technology.



**6.  Consider the following pairs related to Nuclear Fusion:**

   Term/Concept                         Description
1. Plasma                               :   Two light atomic nuclei combine
2. Net Energy Gain (NEG)               :   Process where two light atomic nuclei combine
3. Nuclear Fusion                        :   A state of matter: hot, charged gas
4.  Atomic Nuclei                       :   Occurs in a state of matter called plasma


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Plasma is accurately described as a hot, charged gas composed of positive ions and free-moving electrons, a state of matter essential for nuclear fusion.  Nuclear fusion is correctly defined as the process in which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier one, releasing a substantial amount of energy.  The other pairs incorrectly link terms and descriptions.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7.  With reference to  Genome Editing, consider the following pairs:**

   Technique/Technology                Characteristic
1. CRISPR/Cas9                        :   Uses zinc finger nucleases
2. SDN 1 & SDN 2                      :   Involve alien genetic material
3.  Genome Editing                     :   Modification of existing genetic material
4.  Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs):  Modification of existing genetic material


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 is a specific genome editing technology that utilizes a different mechanism than zinc finger nucleases.  SDN 1 and SDN 2, unlike SDN 3, do not involve alien genetic material.  Genome editing is accurately defined as the alteration of existing genetic material within an organism.  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) involve the introduction of foreign genes, a distinction from genome editing.  Therefore, only pair 3 correctly matches a technique/technology with its characteristic.


**8. Consider the following pairs related to Web 3.0:**

   Feature of Web 3.0                   Description
1.  Decentralized Nature                :   Relies heavily on intermediaries
2.  Peer-to-peer Transactions          :   Enables control over own data
3.  Data Security                        :   Includes cryptocurrencies and NFTs
4.  User Control                         :   Centralized in nature


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Web 3.0 is characterized by its decentralized nature, a departure from the centralized models of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.  Peer-to-peer transactions are a fundamental aspect of Web 3.0, facilitating direct interactions without intermediaries.  Enhanced data security is a key benefit of Web 3.0's decentralized architecture, providing users with more control over their information.  Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are indeed integral components of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 accurately reflect features of Web 3.0 and their descriptions.  Pairs 1 and 4 incorrectly describe Web 3.0's architecture and user control.



**9. With reference to  Crypto Mining, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Crypto Mining              Description/Characteristic
1.  CPU Mining                         :   Uses graphics cards
2.  GPU Mining                         :   Uses processors
3.  Proof-of-Work (PoW)                :   Delegates control to token owners
4.  Proof-of-Stake (PoS)               :   Verifies and secures blockchains


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CPU mining utilizes central processing units (CPUs) for cryptocurrency generation, not graphics cards. GPU mining employs graphics processing units (GPUs) for enhanced computational power, not processors.  Proof-of-work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that verifies and secures blockchains through computational work, not by delegating control to token owners. Proof-of-stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism that delegates validation rights to token holders based on their stake in the network.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.



**10. Consider the following pairs related to 3D Printing:**

   Type of 3D Printing                Characteristic
1. Extrusion-based metal AM           :   Most cost-effective method
2. 4D Printing                        :   Objects change shape post-production
3. Additive Manufacturing              :   Opposite of subtractive manufacturing
4. Subtractive Manufacturing           :   Laying down successive material layers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing can be cost-effective compared to other methods, it's not universally the most cost-effective option across all scenarios. 4D printing is accurately characterized by its ability to create objects that change shape after production. Additive manufacturing is indeed the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, which involves removing material to create a shape. Subtractive manufacturing does not involve laying down successive material layers; that's the core principle of additive manufacturing.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, and while pair 1 is plausible, it is not universally true.


**11. With reference to Wi-Fi 7, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature of Wi-Fi 7                  Description

4.  Uses Radio Waves                   :   Needs three mediums (base station, router, devices)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 is based on the IEEE 802.11be standard and offers significantly higher speeds compared to its predecessor, Wi-Fi 6.  Backward compatibility is a key feature, allowing connections with devices using different frequency bands.  Multi-Link Operation (MLO) contributes to lower latency by using multiple links simultaneously. Wi-Fi utilizes radio waves, requiring a base station, router, and accessing devices for communication.  Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.

   Regulation/Act                           Provision
1.  Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945        :   Allows pharmacies to sell generic medicines regardless of prescription
2.  Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002 :   Makes it mandatory to license drugs with single active ingredient
3.  National Medical Commission Act, 2019   :   Empowers state councils to take disciplinary action against doctors
4.  Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) :   Prescribes generic names in prescriptions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, mandate licensing for single-active-ingredient drug formulations, not the allowance of pharmacies to disregard prescriptions.  The Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002, prescribe the use of generic names in prescriptions, not the licensing of drugs. The National Medical Commission Act, 2019, does empower appropriate bodies to take disciplinary action against doctors for violations of regulations. The DTAB advises on drug-related matters but does not directly prescribe provisions regarding generic names.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**13. With reference to  Rare Diseases, consider the following pairs:**

   Rare Disease                                    Characteristic
1.  Tyrosinemia-Type 1                         :   Seizures
2.  Gaucher's Disease                           :   Lifelong treatment, relatively lower cost
3.  Wilson’s Disease                             :   One-time curative treatment
4.  Dravet or Lennox Gastaut Syndrome         :   Genetic condition, affecting about 1 in 1000 population


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tyrosinemia-Type 1 is a metabolic disorder, not primarily characterized by seizures. Gaucher's disease does indeed require long-term treatment and falls under a relatively lower-cost category in the National Policy for Rare Diseases. Wilson's disease is not typically amenable to a one-time cure. Dravet or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a genetic condition and its prevalence fits the definition of a rare disease. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**14. Consider the following pairs related to Tuberculosis (TB):**

   Type of TB                                 Characteristic
1.  Extrapulmonary TB                      :   Resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin
2.  Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)      :   Affects lungs only
3.  Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) :   Resistant to all first- and second-line drugs
4.  Totally drug-resistant TB (TDR-TB)    :   Resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, plus specific other drugs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Extrapulmonary TB can affect various parts of the body, not just the lungs, making pair 1 incorrect. MDR-TB is defined by resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, not by solely affecting the lungs, making pair 2 incorrect. XDR-TB is accurately defined by its resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, plus specific other drugs, making pair 3 correct. TDR-TB is correctly described as resistant to all first- and second-line drugs, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

   Term/Concept                           Description
1.  Sickle Cell Anaemia                    :   Modification in red blood cell shape
2.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant    :   Only cure for SCD
3.  National Sickle Cell Anaemia Mission :   Aims to eliminate SCD by 2025
4.  CRISPR-based gene therapies           :   Approved for treatment of SCD


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sickle cell anaemia is accurately characterized by the altered shape of red blood cells.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently considered the only curative treatment for SCD.  The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims for elimination, but not necessarily by 2025. CRISPR-based gene therapies have received approval for treating SCD. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 3 has an inaccurate timeline.


**16. Consider the following pairs related to  Chandrayaan-3:**

   Term/Concept                       Description/Characteristic
1.  Vikram Lander                       :   Accomplish a soft landing on the Moon's South Pole
2.  Shiv Shakti Point                   :   Crashing point of Chandrayaan-2 lander
3.  Tidal Locking                       :   Causes high diurnal temperature range on the Moon
4.  Lunar Regolith                     :   Made up of rock chips, mineral fragments, agglutinates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vikram lander successfully achieved a soft landing on the Moon's South Pole. Shiv Shakti Point is where Chandrayaan-3 landed, not the crash site of Chandrayaan-2. Tidal locking is indeed a significant factor contributing to the extreme temperature variations on the Moon's surface. Lunar regolith comprises rock chips, mineral fragments, impact and volcanic glasses, and agglutinates. Therefore, pairs 1, 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 2 incorrectly identifies the location.


**17. With reference to Aditya-L1, consider the following pairs:**

   Payload/Instrument                  Function/Objective
1.  VELC                               :   Observe in-situ particle and plasma environment
2.  SUIT                               :   Study of Solar upper atmospheric dynamics
3.  ASPEX                              :   Study drivers for space weather
4.  PAPA                               :   Study of chromospheric and coronal heating


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

VELC (Visible Emission Line Coronograph) is designed to study solar upper atmospheric dynamics, not in-situ particle and plasma environment. SUIT (Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) is focused on the study of solar upper atmospheric dynamics. ASPEX (Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment) is designed to study drivers for space weather. PAPA (Plasma Analyser Package for Aditya) is intended to study chromospheric and coronal heating.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 incorrectly describes the function of VELC.


**18. Consider the following pairs related to  Viral Diseases:**

   Disease                                 Characteristic
1.  Chikungunya                           :   Transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes
2.  Zika Virus                             :   Associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome
3.  Swine Flu Strain H1N2                  :   Causes bird flu
4.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)              :   Affects cattle, causing fever and skin nodules


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is indeed transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Zika virus is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, among other complications. Swine flu (H1N1) is a type of influenza A virus, while avian influenza (H5N1, H9N2, etc.) affects birds.  Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral disease primarily affecting cattle, causing fever and skin nodules. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 3 incorrectly links swine flu with bird flu.


**19. With reference to  Key Concepts/Terms in Health, consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                         Description
1.  Phage Therapy                       :   Uses bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections
2.  Macrophages                         :   Act as the body's first line of defense against infection
3.  Nuclear Medicine                     :   Uses radioactive tracers to diagnose and treat disease

5. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)                 :   Fungible tokens that can be exchanged without loss of value


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Software as a Service (SaaS) is indeed a cloud-based software delivery model where the cloud provider develops and maintains the application software.  The other pairs are incorrect. Web 3.0, in contrast to the statement, is designed to minimize reliance on intermediaries. Blockchain technology is fundamentally a decentralized and distributed ledger technology, not centralized. While Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies do utilize algorithms for validation, the description of the algorithm's function is overly simplified and doesn't capture its core purpose of securing the blockchain.  Finally, NFTs are explicitly *non-fungible*, meaning they are unique and cannot be exchanged for one another without a change in value;  the description of them as fungible is completely wrong.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge of subtle differences in definitions and to exploit potential misconceptions about the technologies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cryptocurrency Concept                       Description
1.  Stablecoin                                 :   Values fluctuate based on market forces

3.  Utility Token                               :   Provides access to a product or service
4.  Decentralized Finance (DeFi)               :   Centralized platform for cryptocurrency transactions
5.  Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation :   Applies to all types of crypto assets, including NFTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Security tokens do represent ownership in real-world assets, and utility tokens grant access to products or services.  The other pairs are incorrect. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency, unlike the statement. DeFi is fundamentally decentralized, not centralized.  The MiCA regulation specifically *excludes* NFTs and certain other types of crypto assets from its scope. The distractors are carefully chosen to include plausible but ultimately false statements, testing the candidate's precise understanding of these concepts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   3D Printing Technology Aspect             Description

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing process is, in fact, relatively cost-effective compared to some other methods. Additive manufacturing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing; it builds up objects layer by layer. 4-D printing specifically involves objects that *do* change shape after production. CAD is a crucial component of the 3D printing design process. Finally, the National Strategy for Additive Manufacturing was released by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  All the distractors are designed to challenge the examinee's understanding of the core concepts and technologies involved in 3D printing.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Wi-Fi Technology Feature                     Characteristic

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) None
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Wi-Fi 7 is significantly *faster* than Wi-Fi 6. MLO is designed to *reduce* latency. Backward compatibility is a key feature, allowing connection with older devices. The IEEE is the primary standards organization for Wi-Fi. And finally, Wi-Fi uses radio waves for transmission. All the distractors are designed to test the precise knowledge of Wi-Fi technology features and their characteristics, highlighting potential areas of confusion.

3.  FLOPS (floating-point operations per second):   Not a measure of supercomputer performance
4.  RISC-V microprocessor                     :   A closed-source instruction set architecture
5.  National Knowledge Network (NKN)          :   Not involved in connecting supercomputers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) None
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. AIRAWAT is among India's fastest supercomputers.  The NSM has a broader scope than just quantum computing. FLOPS is a standard metric for supercomputer performance. RISC-V is an open-source architecture. And the NKN is crucial for networking the supercomputers under the NSM.  The distractors are carefully constructed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of supercomputing technologies and initiatives in India.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Quantum Technology Concept                  Description
1.  Quantum Computing                          :   Operates solely on classical physics principles

3.  Quantum Coherence                          :   Susceptibility of quantum systems to external disturbances
4.  Quantum Supremacy                         :   Demonstration of quantum computer inferiority
5.  National Quantum Mission (NQM)            :   Does not involve the development of quantum computers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) None
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics. Qubits can represent 0, 1, or a superposition of both. Quantum coherence is the *ability* to maintain a quantum state, not its susceptibility to disturbances. Quantum supremacy demonstrates superiority, not inferiority.  And the NQM explicitly aims at the development of quantum technologies, including quantum computers. The distractors are designed to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, demanding a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of quantum technology.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Artificial Intelligence (AI) Concept          Description

4.  Deep Learning                              :   A subset of machine learning
5.  Deepfakes                                  :   Created without using artificial intelligence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 4 only
(c) None
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched; deep learning is indeed a subset of machine learning.  The other pairs are incorrect. Generative AI is specifically designed to create high-quality content. LLMs are based on neural networks. Multimodal AI processes multiple inputs. And deepfakes heavily rely on artificial intelligence.  The distractors are crafted to challenge the precise definitions and applications of core AI concepts.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dhanush artillery gun's demonstrated range is around 38 km, not 78 km. The Pralay ballistic missile is a surface-to-surface missile, not surface-to-air. The Astra missile's Mk1 version indeed has a range of 80-110 km. The Spike NLOS anti-tank missile's range is up to 30 km, not 130 km. Thus, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the specific capabilities and characteristics of various Indian defense systems.  Incorrect information regarding ranges and missile types is presented as distractors to challenge the candidate's understanding.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lead-acid batteries are standard (non-flow) batteries, not flow batteries. While some lithium-ion batteries utilize solid-state electrolytes, it's not a universal feature of all lithium-ion batteries. Redox flow batteries are a type of flow battery, not standard (non-flow) batteries. Sodium-ion batteries are indeed known for their low cost and the abundance of sodium resources. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the different types and characteristics of battery technologies, including the distinction between flow and non-flow batteries and the materials used in various battery types.


**4. With reference to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and nuclear technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type/Feature              Description
1. Fourth-generation nuclear reactor :   Uses pressurized water for cooling

4.  SMRs                               :   Modular design, factory assembled


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fourth-generation nuclear reactors often use innovative cooling methods, such as gas cooling (helium), not pressurized water. SMRs are characterized by their smaller size compared to conventional reactors. Conventional nuclear power plants typically use pressurized water as a coolant, not helium gas. SMRs are indeed designed with a modular approach, allowing for factory assembly and easier transportation and installation. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The distractors include inaccurate information about cooling methods and reactor sizes to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge of nuclear reactor technology.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to missiles and their features:**

   Missile System                     Feature
1. Pralay Ballistic Missile          :   Range of 1000-1500 km
2. Astra Missile                     :   Surface-to-surface missile
3.  Spike NLOS Anti-Tank Missile   :   Beyond Visual Range (BVR) capability
4.  Hypersonic Missile              :   Speed exceeding Mach 5


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pralay ballistic missile has a range of 150-500 km, not 1000-1500 km. The Astra missile is an air-to-air missile, not a surface-to-surface missile. The Spike NLOS anti-tank missile does not possess Beyond Visual Range (BVR) capabilities. Hypersonic missiles are indeed defined by their speed exceeding Mach 5. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. The other options include deliberately incorrect information regarding ranges, missile types, and capabilities to test the candidate's knowledge of specific missile systems and their characteristics.


**6. With reference to  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies, consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

TAPAS BH-201 is a MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) UAV, not a short-range, low-altitude drone.  The MQ-9B Reaper is known for its long endurance, not high speed or flying-wing design.  The Autonomous Flying Wing Technology Demonstrator (FWTD) does indeed have a flying-wing design. The Dhruv is a helicopter, not a UAV. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dhanush is indeed a 155 mm, 45-calibre towed artillery gun, but its demonstrated range is around 38 km, not 48 km.  The other details in the description are correct.  Varunastra's maximum speed is 40 knots, not 50, and its range is significantly longer than 10km.  Astra's range is closer to 80-110 km (Mk1) and 160 km (Mk2), and its maximum speed is Mach 4.5, not Mach 3.5. Pralay's range and payload capacity are correctly stated. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 have largely correct information although with minor inaccuracies in the specifics, making (b) the most appropriate choice.  The other options include pairs with significant factual errors.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Quantum computing utilizes quantum physics principles, not solely classical physics. Quantum coherence is the *ability* of a quantum system to maintain a defined state, not the inability. Quantum supremacy demonstrates a quantum computer's *superiority*, not inferiority, to classical computers for specific tasks. QKD uses quantum mechanics for secure communication, not classical cryptography.  Therefore, all pairs are incorrectly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Web Technology Feature                  Description
1. Web 1.0                               :   Enabled peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Web 1.0, also known as the Static Web, was primarily characterized by static web pages and limited user interaction.  It did not feature peer-to-peer transactions.  Web 2.0 is accurately described as centralized and reliant on intermediaries like social media platforms and search engines. Web 3.0 correctly incorporates cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) as key features.  Web 4.0, the Symbiotic Web, aims for seamless human-machine interaction, a key differentiating factor. Web 5.0 accurately focuses on decentralized data storage and user control over identity. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because peer-to-peer transactions are a characteristic of Web 3.0, not Web 1.0.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cryptocurrency Concept                 Description
1. Proof-of-Work (PoW)                   :   Delegates network control to token owners
2. Proof-of-Stake (PoS)                   :   Regulates block creation and network integrity through mining
3.  Stablecoin                              :   Value pegged to a currency like the US dollar
4. Security Token                           :   Represents ownership in a real-world asset or enterprise
5. Utility Token                            :   Provides special access to a product or service


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) Only one
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to secure the network and validate transactions through computational work (mining). Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is an alternative consensus mechanism that delegates the validation of transactions to token holders based on their stake in the network, not through mining. Stablecoins maintain a stable value by pegging their value to a fiat currency or other asset.  Security tokens represent ownership or rights in a real-world asset, and utility tokens provide access to a product or service. Therefore, pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly reverse the descriptions of PoW and PoS.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Additive manufacturing is a process of building up a three-dimensional object layer by layer, the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which removes material. Extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing is indeed a cost-effective method compared to other metal 3D printing approaches. 4D printing uses materials that change shape after printing, often in response to stimuli. CAD is essential for creating the digital models needed for 3D printing.  The National Strategy for Additive Manufacturing was released by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.  Therefore, pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 1 incorrectly describes additive manufacturing as subtractive. Pair 3 is correct.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 is indeed based on the Extremely High Throughput (EHT) standard.  It offers significantly faster speeds than Wi-Fi 6, not slower. Multi-Link Operation (MLO) enhances speed and capacity, not reduces them. Backward compatibility allows Wi-Fi 7 to connect with devices using different bands. LiFi is short-range indoor optical wireless communication, not outdoor.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Quantum Technology Concept           Description
1. Quantum Computing                     :   Low error rates, operates at room temperature

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Quantum computing is known for its high error rates and susceptibility to noise.  Quantum coherence describes the ability of a quantum system to maintain a stable quantum state. Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer exceeding the capabilities of classical computers for specific tasks. A qubit can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously, unlike a classical bit. Classical computing utilizes bits, not qubits. Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pairs 1, 4, and 5 incorrectly describe key characteristics of quantum and classical computing and qubits.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

4. Section 66E of the IT Act 2000        :  Specifically addresses deepfakes
5. Watermarking                           : A regulatory measure against deepfakes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GANs are a type of machine learning algorithm used in creating deepfakes. Variational auto-encoders are another type of neural network architecture that can be used for face-swapping in deepfakes. Deep learning is the AI technique underpinning deepfake technology. Watermarking is a technique used to identify synthetically generated content. Section 66E of the IT Act 2000 is a broader provision addressing cybercrimes, not specifically deepfakes.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

IIT-Mandi research found extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing to be a cost-effective method in metal 3D printing.  Therefore, pair 1 is correct. Stereolithography (SLA) is an additive manufacturing process that uses successive layers of materials such as resins or plastics to build three-dimensional objects. Therefore, pair 2 is also correct. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is also an additive manufacturing process, not subtractive; it uses lasers to melt and fuse metal powders layer by layer. Pair 3 is incorrect.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Wi-Fi Technology Feature                  Description
1. Wi-Fi 7 (IEEE 802.11be)                 : Four times faster than Wi-Fi 6
2. Backward Compatibility                    : Connects only with devices of the same band
3. Multi-Link Operation (MLO)               : Increases latency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Wi-Fi 7 offers significantly increased speeds, approximately four times faster than Wi-Fi 6. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Backward compatibility in Wi-Fi allows devices of different bands to connect, not just the same band.  Pair 2 is incorrect. Multi-Link Operation (MLO) in Wi-Fi reduces latency, not increases it. Pair 3 is also incorrect.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Nuclear Reactor Type                      Feature
1. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR)   : Uses natural uranium as fuel
2. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)              : Uses pressurized water for cooling
3. Fourth-generation nuclear reactor       : Uses gas (helium) for cooling


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) utilize natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as a moderator.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Fourth-generation nuclear reactors, including some SMR designs, utilize gas (like helium) for cooling, unlike conventional reactors that use pressurized water. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect as SMRs do not universally use pressurized water for cooling; some use other coolants.

2. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare    :   Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme
3. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers     : Free Drugs Service Initiative of National Health Mission (NHM)
4. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) :  Operationalized provisions of Draft Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) amendment regulations 2011

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was indeed launched in 2008 by the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers.  Its aim is to provide affordable generic medicines to the public.  The Free Drugs Service Initiative is a crucial component of the National Health Mission (NHM), falling under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare's purview.  FSSAI's role in operationalizing the provisions of the Draft Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) amendment regulations, 2011, is also accurately stated. Option (d) is incorrect because the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme is not associated with the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; it's primarily linked to the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, aiming to boost domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing.  Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.

2. Vitamin B9 (folic acid)                  :   Folic acid
3. Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamine)          :   Iron
4. Fortification method for Rice           :  Coating, extrusion and dusting


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of Vitamin B9 (folic acid) with its chemical name, folic acid, and the correct mention of coating, extrusion, and dusting as key technologies in rice fortification are accurate.  The other pairings are incorrect. Iron is not the chemical name of Vitamin B12; cyanocobalamine is. Conversely, cyanocobalamine is not the chemical name of iron.  Therefore, option (b) is the only one that correctly identifies the matched pairs.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Trans Fat                       Source
1. Naturally-occurring trans-fats         :   Commercially baked or fried foods
2. Industrially-produced trans-fats     :   Some dairy and meat products
3. Industrially-produced trans-fats     :   Partially hydrogenated oil (PHO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Industrially-produced trans fats are indeed formed during the hydrogenation of vegetable oil, resulting in partially hydrogenated oil (PHO). This is a factually accurate statement.  The other options are incorrect. Naturally occurring trans fats are found in some dairy and meat products, not commercially baked or fried foods.  Industrially produced trans fats are not primarily found in dairy and meat products; those contain naturally occurring trans fats. Therefore, only option (b) correctly identifies the accurate match.


**4. With reference to Non-Sugar Sweeteners (NSS), consider the following pairs:**

   NSS                                      Description

3. Sucralose                               :   A zero-calorie artificial sweetener made from sugar
4. Sorbitol                                :   A methyl ester of a dipeptide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Acesulfame-K is correctly identified as being derived from aceto-acetic acid, and sucralose is accurately described as a zero-calorie artificial sweetener made from sugar.  The other pairings are incorrect. Aspartame is a methyl ester of a dipeptide, not a polyhydric alcohol (which is sorbitol). Sorbitol is a polyhydric alcohol, not a methyl ester of a dipeptide.  Therefore, option (b) is the only option that correctly matches the pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                  Description
1.  3D Printing                              :   Subtractive manufacturing process
2.  Wi-Fi 7                                  :   Based on IEEE 802.11be

2. Classical Computing                       :   Calculates with qubits
3. Quantum Coherence                         :   Loss of quantum state over time
4. Quantum Supremacy                       :   Classical computer dominance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description of Quantum Coherence as the ability of a quantum system to maintain a well-defined quantum state over time is accurate. The other statements are incorrect.  Quantum computing utilizes qubits, not transistors. Classical computing uses transistors, not qubits. Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer's superior computational capabilities, not classical computer dominance. Thus, only option (c) correctly identifies the single correctly matched pair.

4. Sodium Ion Battery (SIB)                 :   Low cost and abundant sodium resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Solid-state lithium batteries are indeed known for their excellent potential energy density, and Sodium Ion Batteries (SIBs) do utilize the low cost and abundant nature of sodium resources.  The other statements are incorrect. Li-ion batteries typically use liquid electrolytes, not solid electrolytes. Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) batteries can store energy both electrochemically and chemically. Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.

3. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)                   :   Primarily affects poultry
4. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)                   :   Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a cure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chikungunya is correctly identified as being transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.  Zika virus is accurately associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome.  A hematopoietic stem cell transplant is indeed a potential cure for Sickle Cell Disease. The statement about Lumpy Skin Disease is incorrect; it primarily affects cattle, not poultry.  Therefore, only option (b) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.


**10. With reference to  Genome Editing, consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                  Description
1. CRISPR/Cas9                              :   Uses zinc finger nucleases

4.  Recombinant DNA Technology             :   Does not involve gene transfer across species


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gene-drive technology accurately modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance, and genome sequencing correctly determines the order of DNA nucleotides.  The other statements are inaccurate. CRISPR/Cas9 does not use zinc finger nucleases; it uses a different mechanism. Recombinant DNA technology does involve gene transfer across species. Therefore, only option (b) identifies the two accurately matched pairs.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Type                     Feature
1.  Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses enriched uranium as fuel
2.  Molten Salt Reactor                     : Uses liquid salt and carbon dioxide for cooling

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the features of the respective reactor types. Tokamak reactors, as described in the source text, operate on the same principles that power the Sun and stars.  The JT-60SA, an experimental nuclear fusion reactor, serves as a precursor to the larger ITER project.

Option (a) is incorrect because PHWRs utilize *natural* uranium as fuel, not enriched uranium.  The use of enriched uranium is characteristic of other reactor designs.

Option (b) is incorrect because while a molten salt reactor does use liquid salt and carbon dioxide for cooling, making statement 2 correct, the description of tokamaks in other parts of the text does not fully align with the statement in the question.

Option (d) is incorrect for the same reasons as option (b), additionally, the inclusion of statement 1 makes it incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                    Description
1.  Quantum Supremacy                       :  A quantum computer outperforming classical computers on specific tasks.
2.  Quantum Coherence                        :  The ability of a quantum system to maintain a well-defined state over time.

4.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)                   : A nuclear fusion process consuming more energy than it generates.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because pairs 1, 2, and 3 accurately define the given concepts.  Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer's ability to surpass classical computers in specific computations. Quantum coherence describes the stability of a quantum system's state. The Coulomb barrier accurately describes the repulsive force between positively charged nuclei, a crucial hurdle in nuclear fusion.

Option (b), (c), and (d) are all incorrect because they include statement 4, which is an inaccurate description of Net Energy Gain (NEG).  NEG, vital for commercial fusion power, means the fusion process *generates* more energy than it consumes, the opposite of what statement 4 claims.


**3. With reference to  Nuclear Power in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                      Description

2.  PHWR                                    : Uses heavy water as a coolant
3.  KAPP 3                                  : India's largest indigenous nuclear power reactor.
4.  Uranium Enrichment                      : Increasing the percentage of U-238 in mined uranium.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Statement 1 accurately defines criticality in nuclear reactor operation. Statement 3 correctly identifies KAPP 3 as India's largest indigenous nuclear power reactor.

Statement 2 is incorrect because PHWRs use heavy water as a *moderator*, not a coolant.  Coolants are different substances used to manage heat.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Uranium enrichment increases the percentage of U-235, the fissile isotope, not U-238, which is less reactive.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Battery Type                           Characteristic
1.  Lithium-ion Battery                   : Uses a solid electrolyte
2.  Sodium-ion Battery (SIB)             : A viable substitute for Lithium-ion batteries
3.  Flow Battery                           : Consists of pairs of plates immersed in electrolyte

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct.  Statement 2 accurately describes SIBs as a potential replacement for LIBs due to their cost-effectiveness and readily available sodium resources. Statement 4 correctly defines ACC batteries as capable of storing energy in either electrochemical or chemical forms.

Statement 1 is incorrect; while solid-state lithium batteries exist, standard lithium-ion batteries typically use liquid electrolytes.

Statement 3 is incorrect; flow batteries are distinct from standard batteries in their design and use tanks of electrolyte, not immersed plates.


**5. With reference to  Web Technologies, consider the following pairs:**

   Web Version                          Characteristic
1.  Web 1.0                               : Enabled interactive platforms
2.  Web 2.0                               : Centralized and relies on intermediaries

4.  Web 4.0                               : Features control over identity and decentralized data storage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer. Web 2.0 is accurately characterized as centralized and reliant on intermediaries. Web 3.0 correctly describes a system enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries.

Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misattribute characteristics to the different web versions. Web 1.0 was primarily static, not interactive, while the description of Web 4.0 in the provided text does not include the specific features mentioned in statement 4.  The description of Web 4.0 is more about the symbiosis between humans and machines.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cryptocurrency Concept                   Description
1.  Proof-of-Work (PoW)                    : Delegates network control to token owners
2.  Proof-of-Stake (PoS)                    : Uses algorithms to validate cryptocurrency transactions
3.  Stablecoin                               : Value pegged to a real-world asset like gold

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct.  Proof-of-Stake (PoS) indeed uses algorithms for transaction validation.  Stablecoins are often pegged to fiat currencies (like the USD), a real-world asset, although they can also be pegged to other assets. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) leverages distributed ledger technology to offer financial services.

Statement 1 is incorrect; Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a different consensus mechanism that does not delegate control to token owners in the way described.  Statement 3 is partially correct, but the description is overly specific; stablecoins are primarily pegged to fiat currency.  The description is too specific and does not cover all stablecoins.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   3D Printing Related Term                 Description
1.  Additive Manufacturing                   : A process that removes material to create an object.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Multimodal AI accurately combines multiple inputs. LLMs are correctly described as machine learning models based on neural networks. Deepfakes are correctly associated with GANs.

Statement 1 is incorrect; generative AI is focused on content creation, not combining multiple inputs as its primary function.  Multimodal AI also uses deep learning, but that's not its defining characteristic.

   Solar Feature                          Description
1.  Photosphere                           :  Temperature varies between 4000 K and 8000 K.
2.  Chromosphere                          : Layer between photosphere and corona
3.  Coronal Hole                           : Regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields
4.  Solar Flare                             : Giant explosions on the sun sending energy into space


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The chromosphere is correctly identified as the layer between the photosphere and corona. Coronal holes are accurately described as regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields. Solar flares are correctly defined as giant explosions releasing energy into space.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the temperature range given applies to the chromosphere, not the photosphere.  The photosphere has a different temperature range.
