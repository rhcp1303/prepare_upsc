Lab-grown diamonds, due to their unique properties (high surface area, biocompatibility, thermal conductivity, etc.), are indeed suitable for applications in *both* solar cells and fuel cells, as well as components in supercomputers.  The statement incorrectly limits their applications.

Statement 2 is correct. DMFCs do indeed use methanol as a liquid fuel, providing high energy density and a compact system.  The readily transportable nature of liquid methanol is a significant advantage for various applications. The statement correctly describes the advantages of DMFCs.

Statement 3 is correct. Vanadium flow batteries are indeed known for their reliability, safety, and stability in storing renewable energy. While vanadium is a relatively rare element compared to some others, the statement's implication that it is excessively expensive is a potential distractor; the cost-effectiveness compared to other battery technologies is a subject of ongoing research and development.


**4. With reference to radiometric dating and related concepts, consider the following statements:**

1.  Calcium-41, with its half-life of 99,400 years, is a more abundant and easily detectable isotope than Carbon-14 for radiometric dating purposes.
2.  Carbon-14 dating is suitable for determining the age of objects older than approximately 50,000 years.
3. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used to measure the abundance of Calcium-41 for radiometric dating.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Calcium-41 does have a longer half-life than Carbon-14 (making it useful for dating older materials), it is *less* abundant and more difficult to detect than Carbon-14. This makes Carbon-14 a more practical choice for dating younger organic materials.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Carbon-14 dating is *not* suitable for determining the age of objects older than approximately 50,000 years.  Its relatively short half-life limits its applicability to more recent materials.  Beyond 50,000 years, the amount of remaining Carbon-14 becomes too small to measure accurately.

Statement 3 is correct. ATTA is a specialized technique used to measure the extremely low concentrations of Calcium-41, making it possible to apply this isotope to radiometric dating, expanding the range of materials that can be dated accurately.


**5. With reference to nuclear technology, consider the following statements:**

1. India's three-stage nuclear power program utilizes thorium as a primary fuel source in all three stages.
2. Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) primarily use liquid sodium as a coolant, which is a non-moderating coolant.
3.  Thorium reactors are inherently safer than other reactor types because their fuel is already molten and operates at atmospheric pressure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's three-stage program aims to eventually utilize thorium extensively, the *first* stage uses natural uranium, the *second* stage uses plutonium bred from uranium, and *only* the third stage is planned to utilize thorium-based breeder reactors.  The statement is a simplification of a more complex process.

Statement 2 is correct. FBRs indeed utilize liquid sodium as their coolant.  The use of liquid sodium is significant because it is a non-moderating coolant, meaning it does not slow down neutrons, which are essential for maintaining a chain reaction in FBRs.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  Thorium reactors, particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs), do possess inherent safety features.  The fact that the fuel is already molten eliminates the risk of a core meltdown.  However, not all thorium reactors operate at atmospheric pressure; some designs operate at higher pressures. The statement oversimplifies the safety aspects.  The inherent safety is a key advantage, but it's not solely due to the molten fuel and atmospheric pressure.


**1. With reference to the applications of Liquid Nitrogen, consider the following statements:**

1. Liquid nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-corrosive cryogenic fluid with a temperature of -196°C.
2.  Its primary application in the food industry involves freezing and transporting food products, while in medicine, it's used in cryotherapy.
3. Exposure to liquid nitrogen can cause cold burns and frostbite due to its extremely low temperature, but it poses no risk to the central nervous system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the physical properties of liquid nitrogen. It's indeed a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-corrosive cryogenic fluid with an extremely low temperature of -196°C.  Statement 2 correctly identifies its major applications.  Liquid nitrogen's cryogenic properties make it ideal for freezing and preserving food products during transportation, significantly extending their shelf life. In the medical field, cryotherapy utilizes liquid nitrogen's extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissues, such as warts or cancerous cells.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While exposure to liquid nitrogen can indeed cause severe cold burns and frostbite due to rapid freezing of skin tissue,  it can also lead to serious damage to the central nervous system (CNS) if inhaled in large quantities or if there's prolonged exposure.  The extreme cold can damage delicate tissues and cells within the CNS, potentially resulting in long-term neurological problems.


**2. With reference to Methanol and its properties, consider the following statements:**

1. Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol, is a colorless, volatile liquid with a pungent odor, completely miscible with water.
2.  It's primarily used as an alternative fuel and finds applications in the production of synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.
3. Treatment for methanol poisoning involves administering ethanol or an antidote called fomepizole to reduce the toxicity and prevent serious complications.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the characteristics and uses of methanol. Statement 1 correctly describes methanol's physical properties: it is indeed a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic pungent odor and is completely miscible (mixable) with water.  Statement 2 is also accurate in highlighting its uses. Methanol's chemical properties make it a versatile compound. While it can be used as an alternative fuel source (though less common due to toxicity concerns), its major applications lie in various chemical industries. It serves as a crucial building block for synthesizing dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.  Statement 3 correctly outlines the treatment for methanol poisoning.  Methanol is highly toxic if ingested, as it is metabolized into formaldehyde and formic acid, which are extremely harmful.  The treatment focuses on slowing down this metabolic process and neutralizing the toxic byproducts. This is achieved by administering ethanol (which competes for the same metabolic enzymes) or fomepizole, a specific antidote that inhibits the enzyme responsible for methanol's toxic conversion.


**3. With reference to the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Glycemic Index is a measure of how rapidly a carbohydrate-containing food elevates blood glucose levels after consumption, ranging from 0 to 100, with pure glucose at 100.
2.  Professor David Jenkins of the University of Toronto proposed the GI in 1981, and it's primarily determined by internal factors such as amylose content, lipids, proteins, and dietary fiber.
3. High GI foods contribute to rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels, potentially stressing insulin production and utilization, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular issues in the long term.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the Glycemic Index (GI).  It's a numerical scale (0-100) that ranks carbohydrate-rich foods based on their effect on blood glucose levels after consumption.  Pure glucose, being the fastest-acting carbohydrate, serves as the reference point at 100.  Statement 3 correctly explains the health implications of high GI foods.  Foods with a high GI lead to a rapid spike in blood sugar levels.  This rapid increase forces the pancreas to produce large amounts of insulin to regulate blood sugar, potentially overwhelming the system over time.  This continuous stress on the insulin-producing cells increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, high GI diets are often associated with weight gain, increased triglyceride levels, and elevated blood pressure, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  However, statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Professor David Jenkins did indeed propose the GI in 1981,  the determination of GI is not solely based on internal factors. External factors such as cooking methods, processing techniques, and even the way food is stored significantly influence the GI of a food item.  The interaction between internal and external factors determines the final GI value.


**4. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza is caused by avian influenza Type A viruses, classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), with 18 H subtypes and 11 N subtypes.
2. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses cause mild or no disease in poultry, while highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause severe disease and high mortality.
3.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) are key global initiatives involved in monitoring and responding to avian influenza outbreaks, with India being a member of WOAH and having a WHO Collaborating Centre for GISRS in Pune.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct and provide accurate information about avian influenza. Statement 1 correctly identifies the causative agent and the classification system.  Avian influenza is indeed caused by Type A influenza viruses, which are categorized into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface proteins.  The statement accurately mentions the number of known subtypes for both H and N proteins. Statement 2 accurately distinguishes between LPAI and HPAI viruses and their effects on poultry. LPAI viruses generally cause mild or asymptomatic infections in birds, while HPAI viruses cause severe disease and significant mortality, posing a serious threat to poultry populations. Statement 3 correctly highlights the roles of key international organizations in managing avian influenza. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) plays a crucial role in coordinating international efforts to control and prevent animal diseases, including avian influenza.  India is indeed a member of WOAH. The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), under the World Health Organization (WHO), is responsible for monitoring influenza viruses globally, including avian influenza.  The National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune, India, serves as a WHO Collaborating Centre for GISRS, contributing significantly to global surveillance efforts.


**5. With reference to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, consider the following statements:**

1. MRI is a non-invasive medical imaging technique using large magnets and radio waves to generate detailed images of internal body structures without ionizing radiation.
2.  The magnetic field inside the MRI machine interacts with radio waves and hydrogen atoms in the body to create cross-sectional images, providing high resolution and anatomical detail.
3. Iseult, the world's most powerful MRI, produces images of the human brain that could significantly advance our understanding of brain anatomy and diseases like Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, but it uses a different principle than other MRIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the fundamental principles and characteristics of MRI technology. MRI is indeed a non-invasive medical imaging technique that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's internal structures. Unlike X-rays or CT scans, MRI does not use ionizing radiation, making it a safer imaging modality for repeated use.  The process involves a strong magnetic field that aligns the hydrogen atoms in the body.  Radio waves are then used to perturb these aligned atoms, and the signals emitted as they return to their original alignment are detected and processed to generate images.  These images provide high resolution and excellent anatomical detail, allowing doctors to visualize various organs and tissues with remarkable clarity.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Iseult is indeed a powerful MRI machine capable of producing high-resolution brain images that can advance our understanding of brain anatomy and neurological diseases, it utilizes the same fundamental principles of magnetic resonance as other MRI machines.  The difference lies primarily in its enhanced power and sensitivity, allowing for more detailed and precise imaging.  The underlying physics and technology remain consistent across all MRI systems.


**6. With reference to the use of Ethylene in food ripening, consider the following statements:**

1.  FSSAI regulations permit the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening of fruits, provided the concentration does not exceed 100 ppm.
2. Direct contact between any source of ethylene gas and fruits is strictly prohibited by FSSAI regulations to prevent potential health risks and ensure food safety.
3.  The use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening is a universally accepted practice and poses no health risks to consumers as long as the concentration is controlled.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects FSSAI regulations regarding ethylene use in fruit ripening.  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does permit the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening, but it sets a strict limit on the concentration to ensure food safety and prevent harmful effects. Exceeding the permitted concentration of 100 ppm (parts per million) can lead to negative consequences.  Statement 2 accurately describes another crucial FSSAI regulation. Direct contact between ethylene gas sources and fruits is strictly prohibited. This is to prevent uneven ripening, potential contamination, and to ensure that the ethylene gas is distributed properly and safely.  This controlled application method is crucial for food safety.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While controlled use of ethylene can be safe, it's not a universally accepted practice due to potential health and environmental concerns. There are ongoing debates and varying regulations globally regarding its use.  Moreover, even within the permitted concentration, potential health risks, such as respiratory irritation, cannot be completely ruled out, especially with prolonged or high-concentration exposure.  Therefore, FSSAI's regulations reflect a cautious approach to using ethylene in fruit ripening.


**7. With reference to the production methods of biofuels, consider the following statements:**

1. Pyrolysis involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to break it down into bio-oil, syngas, and biochar. Cracking is similar but often uses a catalyst to enhance liquid biofuel yield.
2.  Hydrogenation adds hydrogen to bio-oil under high temperature and pressure to increase the energy content and stability of the resulting fuel. Transesterification is mainly used for biodiesel production, converting fats or oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using an alcohol and catalyst.
3.  Biodiesel production uses only vegetable oils and never animal fats because of potential health risks associated with animal fats.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe established biofuel production methods. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen. This process breaks down complex organic matter into simpler components: bio-oil (a liquid fuel), syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen), and biochar (a solid residue). Cracking is similar to pyrolysis, but it often involves the use of a catalyst to accelerate the breakdown of larger molecules into smaller, more desirable liquid fuel molecules, thereby improving the yield of liquid biofuels.  Hydrogenation is a chemical process used to enhance the quality and properties of bio-oil. In this process, hydrogen is added to bio-oil under high temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst. This increases the energy content and improves the stability of the bio-oil, making it a more suitable fuel. Transesterification is a crucial process specifically used in biodiesel production.  It involves reacting vegetable oils or animal fats with an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst. This reaction converts the triglycerides in the oils or fats into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), which constitute biodiesel, and glycerol, a byproduct.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  Biodiesel can be produced from both vegetable oils and animal fats through the transesterification process. The use of animal fats is not universally prohibited, and many biodiesel producers utilize animal fats as feedstock, especially waste animal fats, to reduce reliance on vegetable oils.  The suitability of animal fats depends on factors such as purity, processing, and the intended application of the biodiesel.


**8. With reference to the energy density of biofuels, consider the following statements:**

1. Diesel fuel has the highest energy density among the commonly used fuels, followed by petrol, biodiesel, and ethanol, respectively.
2.  Biodiesel has a slightly lower energy density than diesel fuel, but its renewable nature and lower emissions profile make it a desirable alternative. Ethanol's energy density is significantly lower than petrol, limiting its use in some applications.
3. The energy density of biofuels is always lower than that of fossil fuels, regardless of the feedstock or production method.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the relative energy densities of the fuels mentioned. Diesel fuel does indeed have the highest energy density among the commonly used transportation fuels, which contributes to its efficiency in heavy-duty applications. Petrol (gasoline) follows with a somewhat lower energy density, making it suitable for various internal combustion engines. Biodiesel typically has a slightly lower energy density than diesel, and ethanol has the lowest energy density among the fuels listed, which is a key factor influencing its application and blending ratios in gasoline.  Statement 2 is also correct in highlighting the trade-offs associated with biodiesel and ethanol. Although biodiesel possesses a lower energy density than diesel, its advantages in terms of renewability and reduced emissions make it an attractive alternative fuel. This is especially important in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental impacts.  Similarly, ethanol's lower energy density is a limitation, but its renewable source and relatively clean burning characteristics make it a valuable component in fuel blends.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The energy density of biofuels is not always lower than that of fossil fuels.  While some biofuels may have lower energy densities, the energy density can vary significantly depending on the feedstock, the production method, and the specific biofuel being considered.  Advanced biofuel production technologies are constantly being developed to improve the energy density of biofuels and make them more competitive with fossil fuels.


**9. With reference to biofuel generations, consider the following statements:**

1. First-generation biofuels are made from food crops such as corn, sugarcane, and soybeans, using fermentation for bioethanol and transesterification for biodiesel. They compete with food supplies.
2. Second-generation biofuels utilize non-food crops and waste biomass, employing gasification, pyrolysis, and biochemical processes. They have lower greenhouse gas emissions than first-generation biofuels.
3. Third-generation biofuels are primarily derived from algae and have minimal competition with food supplies, but their production costs are very low compared to other generations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes first-generation biofuels. These biofuels are indeed produced from food crops like corn, sugarcane, and soybeans. The main production methods are fermentation for bioethanol (from sugars in the crops) and transesterification for biodiesel (from oils in the crops). A major drawback of first-generation biofuels is the competition with food supplies, which can lead to price increases and food security concerns.  Statement 2 correctly describes second-generation biofuels.  These biofuels utilize non-food crops, agricultural residues, and waste biomass as feedstock.  The production processes typically involve more complex technologies such as gasification (converting biomass into syngas), pyrolysis (converting biomass into bio-oil), and advanced biochemical processes. Second-generation biofuels generally have a lower environmental impact and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to first-generation biofuels due to their use of non-food sources.  Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While third-generation biofuels are indeed often derived from algae, and they offer the advantage of minimal competition with food supplies, their production costs are not very low.  Currently, the production of third-generation biofuels is relatively expensive, making them less economically competitive compared to first and second-generation biofuels.  Significant research and development efforts are focused on reducing the production costs of third-generation biofuels to make them more viable.


**10. With reference to hydrogen as an alternative fuel, consider the following statements:**

1. Hydrogen is a non-greenhouse gas emitter, producing only water vapor upon combustion, and it's abundant on Earth, primarily found in water and hydrocarbons.
2.  The main challenges associated with hydrogen fuel are its high extraction cost from water or fossil fuels, low density requiring compression or cryogenic liquefaction for storage and transport, and the need for significant infrastructure investment.
3.  Hydrogen is primarily produced from water using electrolysis powered by renewable energy, a process known as "grey" hydrogen production, which is environmentally friendly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights the key advantages of hydrogen as a fuel. When hydrogen is used as a fuel, the only byproduct of combustion is water vapor, making it a clean energy source with zero greenhouse gas emissions.  Hydrogen is also the most abundant element in the universe, and it's readily available on Earth, primarily in water and hydrocarbons.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the major challenges associated with hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen, particularly from water using electrolysis, is currently energy-intensive and therefore costly. The low density of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure makes its storage and transport challenging.  It requires either high-pressure compression or cryogenic liquefaction to achieve reasonable storage densities, both of which require significant energy input and specialized infrastructure.  Significant investments are needed to develop and deploy the necessary infrastructure for hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and utilization.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The term "grey" hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, which is not environmentally friendly because it involves carbon dioxide emissions.  Hydrogen produced from water using electrolysis powered by renewable energy is known as "green" hydrogen, and it is indeed environmentally friendly.


**11. With reference to Lithium-ion batteries and their components, consider the following statements:**

1. Lithium-ion batteries use graphite as the anode material, lithium oxide as the cathode material, and an electrolyte as the medium for lithium-ion movement between the anode and cathode.
2.  Advantages of lithium-ion batteries include high voltage, high energy density, and low self-discharge rate, making them suitable for various applications from smartphones to electric vehicles.
3. Recent developments include the discovery of lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir, which could potentially reduce India's dependence on lithium imports and boost domestic battery production, completely replacing all lithium imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key components of a typical lithium-ion battery.  Graphite is commonly used as the anode material, providing a site for lithium ions to intercalate (insert between layers) during the battery's discharge cycle.  Lithium metal oxides (such as lithium cobalt oxide or lithium iron phosphate) are frequently used as cathode materials, where lithium ions migrate during the charging process.  The electrolyte is a crucial component, providing a pathway for the lithium ions to move between the anode and cathode during both charging and discharging cycles.  Statement 2 correctly highlights the advantages of lithium-ion batteries that have made them dominant in various applications.  Their relatively high voltage output enables them to power a wide range of devices, from small portable electronics to large electric vehicles.  Their high energy density allows for longer operating times between charges and facilitates the creation of compact and lightweight devices.  The low self-discharge rate means that they retain their charge for a longer period when not in use, making them more efficient for various applications.  Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the discovery of lithium deposits in Jammu and Kashmir is a significant development that could potentially reduce India's reliance on lithium imports and spur domestic battery production, it is unlikely to completely replace all lithium imports in the foreseeable future.  The extent to which these deposits can meet India's growing demand for lithium will depend on factors such as the size and quality of the deposits, the cost and feasibility of extraction, and the development of domestic processing and refining capabilities.


**12. With reference to Sodium-ion batteries and their characteristics, consider the following statements:**

1. Sodium-ion batteries operate similarly to lithium-ion batteries, using sodium ions instead of lithium ions as charge carriers, offering advantages due to sodium's abundance and lower cost.
2.  Advantages of sodium-ion batteries include the abundance and low cost of sodium, resulting in lower battery production costs and a reduced environmental impact compared to lithium-ion batteries.  They also have better safety profiles.
3. Sodium-ion batteries currently have higher energy density and longer cycle life than lithium-ion batteries, making them superior in all applications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the fundamental principle of sodium-ion batteries.  They operate on a similar electrochemical principle to lithium-ion batteries, but they utilize sodium ions (Na+) as the charge carriers instead of lithium ions (Li+).  This substitution offers several potential advantages. Sodium is significantly more abundant and less expensive than lithium, making sodium-ion batteries potentially more cost-effective to produce. Statement 2 correctly points out some key advantages of sodium-ion batteries. The abundance and low cost of sodium directly translate to lower production costs for sodium-ion batteries compared to lithium-ion batteries.  Furthermore, the use of sodium, a less reactive element than lithium, generally results in a lower environmental impact and improved safety profiles. Sodium-ion batteries are generally considered less prone to thermal runaway and fire hazards than lithium-ion batteries.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  Currently, sodium-ion batteries lag behind lithium-ion batteries in terms of energy density and cycle life. While ongoing research and development are aimed at improving these aspects, sodium-ion batteries currently do not surpass lithium-ion batteries in these crucial performance metrics.  Their lower energy density limits their use in applications requiring high energy storage, such as electric vehicles with long driving ranges.  The cycle life, while improving, is still generally shorter than that of high-performance lithium-ion batteries.


**13. With reference to the advantages of biofuels, consider the following statements:**

1. Biofuels have the potential to be carbon-neutral because the CO2 emitted during their combustion is offset by the CO2 absorbed by plants during their growth.
2.  Biofuels can replace or supplement fossil fuels, thereby contributing to energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  They can be used in direct burning, alcohols, and biodiesel.
3.  The use of biofuels poses no environmental risks, and their production methods always have a positive impact on the environment and ecosystems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the potential for carbon neutrality in biofuels. In theory, biofuels can be carbon-neutral because the carbon dioxide (CO2) released during their combustion is approximately equal to the amount of CO2 absorbed by the plants from which they are derived during photosynthesis.  This makes them a potentially cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, which release significant amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.  However, the actual carbon neutrality of biofuels depends on various factors, including the feedstock used, the production processes, and land use changes.  Statement 2 correctly explains the potential applications of biofuels and their contribution to energy security and reduced emissions.  Biofuels can be used to replace or supplement fossil fuels in various applications.  Biomass can be directly burned to produce heat or electricity.  Alcohols like ethanol and methanol can be used as substitutes for petrol, and biodiesel can serve as an alternative to conventional diesel.  These applications contribute to energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While biofuels offer environmental benefits compared to fossil fuels, their production and use aren't entirely without environmental risks.  The production of some biofuels can lead to deforestation, habitat loss, and increased fertilizer use, all of which can have negative consequences for the environment.  Furthermore, the sustainability of biofuel production depends heavily on responsible agricultural practices and efficient resource management.  The environmental impact of biofuels needs to be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering the entire life cycle from production to use.


**14. With reference to Site-Directed Nucleases (SDNs) and their applications, consider the following statements:**

1.  SDNs are categorized into SDN1, SDN2, and SDN3 based on the nature of the edits made to the genome. SDN1 and SDN2 do not involve foreign genetic material, whereas SDN3 does.
2. CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a widely used SDN technique that precisely targets and modifies specific DNA sequences. Other techniques include ZFNs and TALENs.
3.  SDNs are similar to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) as both involve introducing foreign genes to improve crop quality.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the classification of Site-Directed Nucleases (SDNs).  SDNs are indeed categorized into three types (SDN1, SDN2, and SDN3) based on the nature of the genetic modifications made.  SDN1 and SDN2 techniques modify the existing genetic material within the organism without introducing any foreign genetic material. The resulting modifications are indistinguishable from those that could occur naturally through conventional breeding methods.  SDN3 techniques, on the other hand, do involve the introduction of foreign genetic material.  Statement 2 accurately identifies CRISPR-Cas9 as a prominent SDN technology.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing tool that allows for precise targeting and modification of specific DNA sequences. This technology has greatly simplified and accelerated the process of genetic engineering.  Other SDN techniques such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) also exist, but CRISPR-Cas9 has become the most widely adopted due to its relative ease of use and high efficiency.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  SDNs are distinct from Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). While both involve genetic modification, the key difference lies in the nature of the modification.  GMOs involve the introduction of a transgene—a gene from a different species—into the organism's genome.  SDNs, particularly SDN1 and SDN2, modify the existing genetic material within the organism without introducing foreign genes.  Therefore, the resulting organisms are not considered GMOs under most regulatory frameworks.


**15. With reference to Gene-Drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. GDT is a genetic engineering technique that modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, increasing the likelihood of specific genes being passed to future generations.
2.  GDT involves three key components: a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (a molecular scissor), and CRISPR (repetitive DNA sequences).  The genetic material encoding these elements is inserted into an organism’s DNA.
3.  GDT has only been successfully applied to mosquitoes and has not shown promise in other organisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines Gene-Drive Technology (GDT).  GDT is indeed a genetic engineering technique used to alter the natural inheritance patterns of genes within a population.  It aims to increase the probability of a specific gene being inherited by offspring, overriding the typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. This can be used to spread desirable traits or eliminate undesirable ones within a population more efficiently than conventional breeding methods.  Statement 2 correctly describes the key components of GDT systems.  A functional gene-drive system typically requires three main elements: a gene (the target gene to be spread), the Cas9 enzyme (a molecular scissor that cuts DNA at specific locations), and CRISPR (short palindromic repeats that guide the Cas9 enzyme to the target gene).  The genetic material encoding these three components is inserted into the organism's genome.  The Cas9 enzyme, guided by the CRISPR sequence, cuts the target gene, and the cell's repair mechanisms then incorporate a modified copy of the gene into the genome, ensuring the gene is inherited by offspring.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While GDT has shown promising results in controlling mosquito populations (by making them produce sterile offspring), its potential applications extend beyond mosquitoes.  Research is actively underway to explore GDT applications in various organisms, including other disease vectors, invasive species, and even for conservation purposes.  The feasibility and ethical implications of GDT are still being investigated in various species, and it's not limited to mosquitoes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GI compares the blood glucose response to a carbohydrate-containing food with that of pure glucose (which has a GI of 100), not sucrose.  Sucrose is a disaccharide (table sugar), whereas glucose is a monosaccharide (simple sugar) and serves as the reference point for GI calculations.

Statement 2 is correct. The Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive metric than GI, considering both the GI value and the amount of carbohydrates consumed in a particular serving of food.  This provides a better indication of the overall impact on blood sugar levels.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the source correctly attributes the concept of GI to David Jenkins, it was the Glycemic Index (GI), not the Glycemic Load (GL), that he proposed in 1981. GL is a subsequent development building upon the GI concept.


**6. With reference to  Avian Influenza, consider the following statements:**

1.  Avian influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on the proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
2.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has 183 member countries.

1.  MRT involves replacing faulty mitochondria in a mother's egg or embryo with healthy mitochondria from a father's egg.
2.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) is a technique used in MRT where the mother's nucleus is transferred to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria.
3.  Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) involves fertilizing both the mother's egg and a donor egg with the father's sperm before transferring the pronuclei.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MRT uses a *donor egg* with healthy mitochondria, not a father's egg.  The father's sperm is used for fertilization after the mitochondrial replacement process.  Using the father's egg would not address the issue of faulty maternal mitochondria.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of MST accurately reflects the procedure involved: removing the mother's nucleus, transferring it to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, and then fertilizing the reconstructed egg.

Statement 3 is correct.  PNT involves the fertilization of both the mother's and donor eggs, followed by the transfer of the pronuclei (containing the genetic material from both parents) from the mother's egg to the enucleated donor egg.  This ensures the child inherits the mother's nuclear DNA and the donor's healthy mitochondria.


**8. With reference to  the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAC is jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAC is jointly established by the WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), not the WTO. While the WTO recognizes Codex standards, it is a separate organization focused on international trade regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. The source explicitly mentions that India is a member of the CAC, highlighting its participation in the development and adoption of international food standards.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Codex standards are *voluntary*, not mandatory.  Although they are widely recognized and influential, countries are not legally obligated to adopt them.  However, the adoption of Codex standards facilitates international trade by providing a common framework for food safety and quality.


**9. Consider the following statements about E-cigarettes:**

2.  E-cigarettes heat a substance to create an aerosol for inhalation, which may or may not contain nicotine and flavorings.
3.  The Act exempts products licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, from its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019, *bans* the production, manufacture, import, export, transport, sale, distribution, storage, and advertisement of e-cigarettes in India.  This reflects concerns about the potential health risks associated with e-cigarette use.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided definition of e-cigarettes accurately describes their mechanism: heating a substance (which may or may not contain nicotine and flavorings) to produce an aerosol for inhalation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act explicitly excludes products licensed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. This exemption likely applies to specific pharmaceutical nicotine replacement therapies or other regulated products that may have different regulatory frameworks.


**10. With reference to  the  National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO), consider the following statements:**

1. NOTTO is under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, was amended in 2011 to include provisions for tissue transplantation.
3. NOTTO's primary function is to conduct organ transplants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The source text accurately identifies NOTTO as an organization operating under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  This places it within the broader governmental framework for healthcare regulation and policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, was indeed amended in 2011 as the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act (THOTA) 2011 to incorporate provisions for tissue transplantation alongside organ transplantation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. NOTTO's role is primarily focused on *coordination and networking* in organ and tissue transplantation activities, not the direct conduct of transplants.  The actual transplantation procedures are carried out by medical professionals in hospitals and transplant centers.  NOTTO works to facilitate the process, regulate it, and maintain standards.


**1. With reference to the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Glycemic Index ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose having a GI of 100.
2.  Lipids, proteins, and dietary fiber are external factors influencing a food's GI.
3.  High GI foods cause rapid blood sugar fluctuations, potentially straining insulin production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a scale from 0 to 100 that measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels. Pure glucose, being the fastest-acting carbohydrate, has a GI of 100.  Foods with a high GI (above 70) raise blood sugar rapidly, while low GI foods (below 55) cause a slower, more gradual increase.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lipids, proteins, and dietary fiber are *internal* factors that affect a food's GI.  Internal factors are inherent properties of the food itself. External factors such as cooking methods and processing techniques also influence GI, but the statement incorrectly attributes internal factors as external. Amylose structure, lipid content, protein content, phytic acid, dietary fiber, and resistant starch within the food itself all impact the rate of digestion and glucose absorption.

Statement 3 is correct. High GI foods lead to rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. This rapid increase necessitates a swift insulin response from the pancreas.  In individuals with diabetes or impaired insulin function, this rapid fluctuation can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively, leading to various health complications.  Consistent consumption of high GI foods can strain the pancreatic beta-cells responsible for insulin production, potentially contributing to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes over time.


**2. With reference to Methanol, consider the following statements:**

1. Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol, is a colorless, volatile liquid with a pungent odor, completely miscible with water.
2. Methanol poisoning treatment involves administering ethanol as a competitive inhibitor, preventing methanol metabolism into toxic byproducts.
3.  Methanol is primarily used as a fuel source, with limited applications in pharmaceuticals and synthetic dyestuffs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Methanol (CH3OH), also known as wood alcohol, is indeed a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic faintly sweet, pungent odor. Its high polarity due to the hydroxyl group makes it completely miscible (mixable) with water.

Statement 2 is correct.  Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor in the treatment of methanol poisoning. Both methanol and ethanol are metabolized by the same enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase. By administering ethanol, a less toxic alcohol, it competes with methanol for the enzyme's active site, slowing down the conversion of methanol into its toxic metabolites (formaldehyde and formic acid). This buys time for the body to eliminate the methanol before significant harm is done. Fomepizole is another antidote that can be used.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While methanol can be used as an alternative fuel, its primary applications are far more diverse than that.  It serves as a crucial precursor in the synthesis of various chemicals, including formaldehyde (used in resins and plastics), acetic acid (used in vinegar and other chemicals), and other important industrial chemicals.  It also finds use as a solvent in certain processes and has some applications in the pharmaceutical industry as a reactant in the synthesis of specific drugs.  The statement significantly underrepresents its industrial and chemical importance.



**3. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), with 18 H subtypes and 11 N subtypes.
2. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry, while highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause mild or no disease.
3.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) collaborate on global avian influenza surveillance and response, with the National Institute of Virology (Pune) serving as a WHO collaborating center for GISRS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The classification of avian influenza viruses is indeed based on the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).  There are 18 known hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N11). These subtypes determine the virus's ability to infect different host species and its virulence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement reverses the pathogenicity of LPAI and HPAI viruses.  LPAI viruses typically cause mild or asymptomatic infections in poultry, while HPAI viruses are highly pathogenic, causing severe disease and high mortality rates.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the severity and public health implications of different outbreaks.

Statement 3 is correct. The WOAH (World Organisation for Animal Health) plays a significant role in international collaboration on animal health, including avian influenza. The GISRS (Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) is a crucial WHO initiative for monitoring and responding to influenza outbreaks globally.  The National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune is recognized as a WHO collaborating center for GISRS, contributing to global surveillance efforts.


**4. With reference to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, consider the following statements:**

1. MRI uses ionizing radiation, similar to X-rays, to produce detailed images of internal structures.
2.  The strong magnetic field in an MRI machine interacts with radio waves and hydrogen atoms in the body to generate cross-sectional images.
3.  Iseult, the world's most powerful MRI, is primarily used for scanning non-human subjects for research purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MRI is fundamentally different from X-rays in its mechanism.  While X-rays use ionizing radiation, MRI utilizes a strong magnetic field and radio waves. This non-ionizing nature makes MRI a safer imaging technique, especially for repeated scans.

Statement 2 is correct.  The principle of MRI relies on the interaction between a strong magnetic field, radio waves, and the abundant hydrogen atoms in the body. The magnetic field aligns the hydrogen atoms, and radio waves then perturb this alignment. The signals emitted as the atoms realign are detected and used to reconstruct detailed images of the body's internal structures.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Iseult's immense power allows for unprecedented detail and resolution in brain imaging, it is indeed used for human subjects. The purpose is to significantly advance our understanding of brain anatomy and its relation to neurological disorders and psychological conditions. The high resolution images obtained from Iseult are invaluable for research in human neurology and psychiatry.


**5. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, modify existing genetic material, unlike genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which introduce foreign genes.
2.  SDN 1 and SDN 2 genome editing techniques involve the use of alien genetic material, resulting in products indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.
3.  Bt cotton, a genetically modified crop, contains genes from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, conferring resistance to bollworm pests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Genome editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, ZFNs, and TALENs directly modify an organism's existing DNA sequence.  They do not introduce foreign genes from other species. This is a key difference between genome editing and genetic modification (GM). GMOs, on the other hand, involve the insertion of genes from a different species into the target organism's genome.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly describes SDN 1 and SDN 2.  SDN 1 and SDN 2 methods *do not* involve alien genetic material; they modify the existing genome without introducing any foreign DNA.  It is SDN 3 that utilizes foreign genetic material.  The products of SDN 1 and SDN 2 are thus considered to be essentially the same as conventionally bred varieties.

Statement 3 is correct. Bt cotton is a classic example of a genetically modified organism. It has been engineered to incorporate genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). These genes produce proteins toxic to bollworm pests, providing a built-in pest control mechanism that reduces the need for chemical pesticides.  This is a clear example of introducing foreign genetic material to enhance crop characteristics.


**6. With reference to Stem Cells, consider the following statements:**

1. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into specialized cell types.
2.  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are derived from adult cells and can differentiate into all cell types of the body, similar to embryonic stem cells.
3.  Stem cell therapy exclusively involves allogeneic transplantation, using stem cells from a donor to treat diseases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Stem cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew (divide and create more stem cells) and differentiate (develop into specialized cell types). This unique property makes them a focus of regenerative medicine research.  Their pluripotency or multipotency allows them to form a variety of different cell types, depending on the type of stem cell.

Statement 2 is correct. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a revolutionary development in stem cell research.  Scientists can reprogram adult somatic cells (e.g., skin cells) back into a pluripotent state, meaning they can differentiate into any cell type in the body, similar to embryonic stem cells. This avoids the ethical concerns and limitations associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Stem cell therapy encompasses both autologous and allogeneic transplantation.  Autologous transplantation uses the patient's own stem cells, minimizing the risk of rejection. Allogeneic transplantation utilizes stem cells from a donor, requiring careful matching to reduce the risk of rejection.  The statement incorrectly limits stem cell therapy to only one method.


**7. With reference to Gene Drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. Gene drive technology modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, increasing the likelihood that specific genes will be passed on to the next generation.
2.  Gene drive systems consist of a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (acting as a molecular scissor), and CRISPR sequences, all inserted into an organism's DNA.
3. GDT applications have shown promising results in reducing mosquito populations by increasing the frequency of genes that cause sterility in offspring, thereby impacting disease transmission.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gene drive technology is a powerful genetic engineering technique that fundamentally alters the rules of inheritance.  It biases inheritance patterns, ensuring that a specific gene (or set of genes) is passed down to a much higher proportion of offspring than would be expected under normal Mendelian inheritance.  This allows for rapid spread of the modified gene within a population.

Statement 2 is correct. A typical gene drive system incorporates three key components: the target gene to be spread, the Cas9 enzyme (a DNA-cutting enzyme), and guide RNA sequences (CRISPR) that direct Cas9 to the specific location in the genome where the gene should be inserted or modified. These elements are integrated into the organism's genome to ensure their inheritance.

Statement 3 is correct.  One of the most promising applications of GDT is in controlling disease vectors, particularly mosquitoes. By introducing genes that cause sterility or other detrimental effects, GDT can significantly reduce mosquito populations, thereby impacting the spread of diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.  Successful field trials have demonstrated the potential of this technology.


**8. With reference to  Ethylene and Liquid Nitrogen in Food Processing, consider the following statements:**

1. FSSAI permits the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening of fruits, provided the concentration does not exceed 100 ppm.  
2. Liquid nitrogen, a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and extremely cold cryogenic fluid, is used for freezing and transporting food products, but can cause cold burns upon direct contact with skin.
3. The use of liquid nitrogen in food items is unregulated in all Indian states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does allow the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening of fruits. However, strict regulations are in place to ensure safety.  The permitted concentration is capped at 100 ppm (parts per million) to minimize potential health risks associated with excessive exposure to the gas. Direct contact with the gas source is prohibited.

Statement 2 is correct. Liquid nitrogen (LN2) is indeed used extensively in the food industry for its cryogenic properties.  Its extremely low temperature (-196°C) allows for rapid freezing of food products, preserving their quality and extending their shelf life.  However, direct skin contact with LN2 can cause severe cold burns or frostbite due to its extremely low temperature.  Proper safety measures are essential when handling liquid nitrogen.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the regulation of food additives and technologies varies slightly across states, the use of liquid nitrogen is not entirely unregulated across India.  The example given in the source content shows that at least one state (Tamil Nadu) actively monitors its use in food items, indicating a level of regulatory oversight.  This suggests that regulatory frameworks are in place, or in the process of being developed, in other states as well.  The statement is therefore an overgeneralization.


**1. Consider the following statements about stem cells:**

1.  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) are a type of adult stem cell derived from bone marrow.
2.  Stem cell therapy (SCT) can involve allogeneic transplantation, using stem cells from a donor.
3.  The primary application of stem cells in toxicology is to assess the impact of drugs on the immune system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iPS cells are not adult stem cells; they are created by reprogramming adult cells to an embryonic-like pluripotent state.  Adult stem cells are found in various tissues and have limited differentiation potential compared to embryonic stem cells or iPS cells.  Bone marrow contains hematopoietic stem cells, a type of adult stem cell, but not iPS cells.

Statement 2 is correct. Allogeneic transplantation is a key method in stem cell therapy where stem cells from a genetically different donor are introduced into a recipient. This is a common approach, especially in bone marrow transplantation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While stem cells can be used in toxicology research, their primary application isn't assessing drug impact on the immune system. Instead, they are valuable tools for modeling drug effects on various cell types and tissues, helping to predict toxicity and efficacy before human clinical trials.  The immune response to drugs is a separate area of study, often involving immunology techniques.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T cell) therapy:**

2.  CAR-T cell therapy is a type of cellular immunotherapy that uses genetically modified T cells to destroy cancer cells.
3.  A significant challenge of CAR-T cell therapy is the potential for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), an overactive immune response.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NexCar19 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 protein, not CD20.  CD19 and CD20 are both surface markers found on B cells, but they are distinct proteins.  Targeting the wrong antigen would render the therapy ineffective.

Statement 2 is correct. CAR-T cell therapy is indeed a type of cellular immunotherapy that involves genetically modifying a patient's T cells to recognize and eliminate cancer cells more effectively. This is a core principle of the therapy.

Statement 3 is correct. CRS is a serious and potentially life-threatening side effect of CAR-T cell therapy.  The rapid and excessive release of cytokines can lead to organ damage and other complications. This is a significant challenge that researchers are actively working to mitigate.


**3. With reference to the application of synthetic embryos, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Synthetic embryos, by providing a model of early human development, offer a valuable tool for studying the impact of various factors, including genetic and environmental ones, on embryonic growth.  This allows for controlled experiments that are ethically challenging or impossible with natural embryos.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Synthetic embryos, at their current stage of development, lack a beating heart and a fully formed brain. They resemble early-stage embryos, possessing cells that would eventually give rise to structures like the placenta and yolk sac but are far from fully developed organs.

Statement 3 is correct. Studying synthetic embryos holds immense potential for understanding why some pregnancies fail. By observing the development of these models under various conditions, researchers can gain insights into the biological mechanisms underlying recurrent miscarriages and other pregnancy complications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DEEP project's explicit goal is to address the underrepresentation of diverse populations in health research.  It actively seeks to generate genomic datasets from various underrepresented populations across different continents, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  Focusing solely on European populations would contradict the project's core aim.

Statement 2 is correct.  Analyzing DNA methylation data is a central component of the DEEP project's methodology. DNA methylation patterns are crucial epigenetic markers that influence gene expression and are associated with various health conditions. The project uses this information to understand disease mechanisms.

Statement 3 is correct. CSIR-CCMB, India, is explicitly mentioned as a collaborating institution in the DEEP project description.


**5. With reference to  CAR-T cell therapy and its components, consider the following statements:**

1. Cytokines are signaling molecules that play a crucial role in the normal immune response, but excessive production can lead to a cytokine storm.
2.  B cells are a type of white blood cell that directly attacks foreign invaders and produces cytokines.
3.  Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that includes T cells and B cells, both originating in the bone marrow.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cytokines are indeed signaling molecules that are essential for coordinating the immune response.  However, excessive cytokine production, as seen in CRS, leads to a cytokine storm, a potentially dangerous overreaction of the immune system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While B cells are crucial components of the immune system and produce antibodies, they do not directly attack foreign invaders in the same way T cells do.  Cytokine production is primarily associated with T cells, macrophages, and other immune cells.

Statement 3 is correct. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell, and T cells and B cells are the two major types of lymphocytes. Both originate in the bone marrow, although they mature in different locations.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Tissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field that integrates principles from materials science and cell biology to develop methods for creating substitute tissues or enhancing the body's natural repair mechanisms.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the CDSCO's approval of the first indigenously developed animal-derived tissue engineering scaffold for skin wound healing in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Tissue engineering encompasses a broader scope than just creating artificial organs. It also includes strategies to repair or regenerate damaged tissues within the body, using various biomaterials and cell-based techniques.  The focus isn't solely on transplantation.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning  epigenetics and the DEEP project:**

1. Epigenetic changes alter the DNA sequence, making them irreversible.
2.  DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification where a methyl group is added to the DNA molecule.  High levels lead to gene silencing.
3. The DEEP project aims to generate genomic datasets from diverse populations to understand the genetics behind Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A key characteristic of epigenetic modifications is their reversibility. They do not change the underlying DNA sequence but alter how genes are expressed.  Genetic changes, in contrast, are typically permanent alterations to the DNA sequence itself.

Statement 2 is correct. DNA methylation is a well-established epigenetic mechanism. The addition of a methyl group to DNA bases can affect gene expression, often leading to gene silencing when methylation levels are high.

Statement 3 is correct. The DEEP project explicitly focuses on generating genomic data from diverse populations to better understand the genetic basis of NCDs, which are a major global health concern.  This addresses the historical bias in genomic research towards specific populations.


**8. With reference to  plant tissue culture (PTC), consider the following statements:**

1. PTC relies on the totipotency of plant cells, the ability of a single cell to develop into a whole plant.
2.  Embryo culture, a type of PTC, involves culturing the plant embryo in vitro conditions.
3.  PTC primarily focuses on producing genetically identical plants, negating the potential for genetic improvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The foundation of PTC is the totipotency of plant cells, meaning a single cell has the potential to regenerate into a whole plant. This is the basis for techniques like micropropagation.

Statement 2 is correct. Embryo culture is a specific PTC technique where plant embryos are isolated and cultivated in vitro, allowing for the production of plants from immature embryos or embryos with specific characteristics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While PTC can produce genetically identical plants through techniques like micropropagation, it also plays a crucial role in genetic improvement.  It is used in various genetic engineering methods that enhance desirable traits in plants.  PTC is a tool that can be used for both clonal propagation and genetic modification.

Statement 3 correctly reflects the Tamil Nadu Food Safety Commissioner's directive to monitor liquid nitrogen usage due to associated health concerns.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the three statements.


**2. With reference to Methanol and its properties, consider the following statements:**

1. Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol, is a colorless, volatile liquid with a faintly sweet, pungent odor and is completely miscible with water.  Its primary use is as a fuel additive, surpassing its application in synthetic dyestuffs.
2.  The FDA issued warnings regarding methanol-containing hand sanitizers due to the potential for severe health consequences, including permanent blindness and central nervous system damage.
3.  Treatment for methanol poisoning involves administering ethanol or the antidote fomepizole; however, the use of methanol in perfumes is safe due to its low concentration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Statement 1 accurately describes methanol's properties (colorless, volatile, pungent odor, miscibility with water). While methanol *is* considered an alternative fuel, the statement incorrectly prioritizes this use over its applications in other industries like dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals. This makes it a misleading but plausible distractor. Statement 2 accurately conveys the FDA's warnings about the dangers of methanol exposure from hand sanitizers. Statement 3 is incorrect; it falsely claims the safety of methanol in perfumes and misrepresents the complete picture of methanol poisoning treatment. The low concentration in perfumes does not negate the inherent toxicity.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Glycemic Index (GI) and Glycemic Load (GL):**

1.  The Glycemic Index (GI) measures how rapidly a carbohydrate-containing food elevates blood glucose levels after consumption, ranking foods on a scale of 0 to 100 relative to pure glucose (GI of 100).  High GI foods are always associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes.
2. Glycemic Load (GL) combines the GI with the total carbohydrate content of a food serving to provide a more comprehensive measure of a food's impact on blood sugar.  Foods with high GL consistently contribute to weight gain and cardiovascular diseases.
3. The concept of GI was initially proposed by Professor David Jenkins of the University of Toronto in 1981; however, external factors such as food preparation methods have minimal impact on the GI of foods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. While statement 1 correctly defines GI, it incorrectly states that high GI foods are *always* linked to type 1 diabetes. High GI foods are more strongly associated with type 2 diabetes. Statement 2 correctly defines GL and its purpose.  However, it overstates the certainty of the link between high GL and weight gain/cardiovascular disease; while a strong correlation exists, it's not an absolute, deterministic relationship.  Statement 3 correctly attributes the development of the GI concept to Professor Jenkins and the year, but it incorrectly minimizes the significant influence of external factors like cooking and processing on GI values.  The combination of partially correct and partially incorrect statements makes this a challenging question.

1. JWST is primarily designed to observe the universe in visible light, offering high-resolution images of distant galaxies.
2. JWST's infrared capabilities allow it to peer through dust clouds, revealing the formation of stars and planetary systems.
3. JWST is positioned at the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point, maintaining a stable orbit and minimizing interference from sunlight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While JWST does capture visible light, its primary function and groundbreaking advancements lie in its infrared capabilities.  Its ability to detect infrared wavelengths allows it to observe objects that are too faint or distant to be seen in visible light.  The telescope is designed to observe in near-infrared and mid-infrared ranges, allowing it to see farther back in time and penetrate dust clouds that obscure visible light.

Statement 2 is correct. JWST's infrared vision is crucial for observing the early universe and the formation of stars and planets obscured by dust clouds. Infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light and can pass through dust clouds more easily.  This enables JWST to see through these interstellar obstructions, revealing the processes of star and planetary system formation.

Statement 3 is correct.  The L2 Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position in space, allowing JWST to maintain its position with minimal fuel expenditure.  This location also keeps the telescope shielded from the sun, Earth, and moon, minimizing interference and heat that could affect its infrared observations.

1. Aditya-L1 is designed to study the Sun's photosphere, the visible surface of the Sun, with a focus on sunspots and solar flares.
2. Aditya-L1 carries a suite of instruments to measure the solar wind's composition and speed, providing insights into space weather.
3. Aditya-L1 is positioned at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point to enable continuous observation of the Sun.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but incomplete.  Aditya-L1 does study solar phenomena, including solar flares, but its focus extends beyond the photosphere to include the chromosphere and corona. The photosphere is only one layer of the Sun's atmosphere that Aditya-L1 observes.  The mission's instruments are designed to study the dynamics of the Sun's upper atmosphere, going beyond just surface features.

Statement 2 is correct.  Several of Aditya-L1's payloads are dedicated to in-situ measurements of the solar wind. This includes its composition, speed, and other characteristics.  Understanding the solar wind is critical for predicting and mitigating the effects of space weather on Earth.

Statement 3 is correct.  The L1 Lagrange point provides an ideal location for continuous solar observation, as it remains relatively stable between the Earth and the Sun.  This eliminates the need for frequent course corrections and allows for uninterrupted data collection.


**3. With reference to Gene-drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. GDT is a gene editing technology that introduces a new gene into an organism's genome, but it does not alter the existing genes.
2. GDT aims to spread a modified gene through a population rapidly, potentially eliminating undesirable traits.
3. GDT is exclusively used in agriculture to enhance crop yields and pest resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GDT is indeed a form of gene editing, but it doesn't just *introduce* a new gene; it modifies *existing* genes in a way that ensures the modified gene is inherited by almost all offspring.  This is achieved by altering the gene's drive mechanism, increasing the likelihood of the modified gene's transmission to the next generation.

Statement 2 is correct. The core purpose of GDT is to rapidly spread a modified gene within a population. This can be used to eliminate undesirable traits, such as disease resistance in disease vectors, or to introduce beneficial traits, although the latter is still largely theoretical. The rapid spread is a key feature differentiating it from traditional genetic modification methods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While GDT has potential applications in agriculture, its use is not limited to that sector.  It's being explored for various applications, including the control of invasive species, the management of disease vectors, and even conservation efforts. Its potential applications extend far beyond agriculture.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Chandrayaan-3:**

2. The Chandrayaan-3 mission primarily focused on studying the Moon's equatorial region, similar to previous lunar missions.
3. Chandrayaan-3's Vikram lander and Pragyan rover were designed to operate continuously throughout the lunar day-night cycle.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Chandrayaan-3 achieved a historic soft landing, but it landed on the Moon's south pole, not the near side.  This made India the fourth country to achieve a soft landing and the first to land near the lunar south pole.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The selection of the lunar south pole was a deliberate choice, unlike previous missions that primarily targeted the equatorial region. The south pole is of significant scientific interest due to the potential presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vikram lander and Pragyan rover were put into sleep mode before the lunar night to conserve power.  Their solar-powered systems are not designed to withstand the extremely low temperatures of the lunar night.  The mission was planned with consideration for the lunar day-night cycle.


**5. With reference to  Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, consider the following statements:**

1. Li-ion batteries utilize sodium ions as charge carriers to store and release electrical energy.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes methanol's physical properties.  It's indeed a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic pungent odor and is completely miscible (mixable) with water. These properties are important for its handling and applications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While methanol has some applications in the chemical industry, its main uses are not in plastics and polymer production. Its primary use is as a solvent, fuel additive (though less common now due to toxicity concerns), and a feedstock for the production of other chemicals like formaldehyde.  The statement misrepresents the primary role of methanol in chemical production.

Statement 3 is correct. Ethanol is an established treatment for methanol poisoning.  Both methanol and ethanol are metabolized by the same liver enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase.  Administering ethanol essentially saturates the enzyme, reducing the rate at which methanol is converted into its toxic byproducts, formaldehyde and formic acid. This reduces the severity of the poisoning.


**3. With reference to Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how slowly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels after consumption, ranked on a scale of 0 to 100.
2.  Foods with a high GI, such as white bread and sugary drinks, cause a rapid surge in blood glucose, potentially leading to increased insulin secretion and subsequent blood glucose crashes.
3.  The Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the GI of a food and the total amount of carbohydrates in a serving to provide a more comprehensive assessment of its impact on blood glucose levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Glycemic Index measures how *quickly* a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels, not how slowly.  A higher GI indicates a faster rise in blood glucose.  The wording of the statement subtly alters the core meaning of GI.

Statement 2 is correct. High-GI foods do lead to rapid increases in blood glucose levels. This rapid rise triggers a corresponding increase in insulin release to bring the glucose levels back down. This fluctuation can be problematic for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance.  The statement correctly links high GI with rapid glucose surges and potential negative consequences.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive metric than GI alone.  It accounts for both the speed at which blood glucose rises (GI) and the quantity of carbohydrates consumed in a serving.  A food might have a high GI but a low GL if the serving size contains a small amount of carbohydrates. The statement correctly explains the relationship between GI and GL.


**4. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza is caused by infection with avian influenza Type B viruses, which are further categorized into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Dark matter, by definition, does *not* interact with the electromagnetic force. This is precisely why it is so difficult to observe directly; it doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Statement 2 is correct.  The primary evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on the motion of galaxies and galaxy clusters.  Observations show that galaxies rotate faster than they should based on the visible matter alone, indicating the presence of additional, unseen mass. Statement 3 is correct. Current cosmological models estimate that dark matter accounts for approximately 27% of the total mass-energy density of the universe, significantly outweighing the contribution of ordinary (baryonic) matter.


**9. With reference to  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), consider the following statements:**

1. FRBs are brief bursts of electromagnetic radiation observed primarily in radio-wave frequencies, lasting for seconds.
2. The dispersion of FRBs as they travel through interstellar and intergalactic medium allows scientists to measure the distribution of matter between galaxies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FRBs are indeed brief bursts of electromagnetic radiation observed primarily in radio-wave frequencies, but they typically last for milliseconds or thousandths of a second, not seconds.  Their brevity makes them challenging to detect. Statement 2 is correct. The dispersion of FRBs – the phenomenon where low-frequency radio waves slow down more than high-frequency waves as they pass through ionized matter – allows astronomers to map the distribution of this matter, even in regions that are otherwise invisible. Statement 3 is correct.  While the exact mechanisms behind FRBs are still under investigation, stellar remnants like white dwarfs, neutron stars, and potentially even magnetars (highly magnetized neutron stars), are strong candidates as sources.  The intense magnetic fields and energetic processes associated with these objects could plausibly generate the powerful bursts observed.


**10. With reference to  Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GRBs are indeed the most powerful and luminous explosions known in the universe.  These brief, intense bursts of gamma rays release enormous amounts of energy in a short period. Statement 2 is also correct.  Studies suggest that the extreme energy released by GRBs could temporarily affect Earth's ozone layer, although the extent and frequency of such impacts are subject to ongoing research.  The ionization caused by GRB radiation could lead to a temporary reduction in ozone concentration. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the birth of black holes is a significant cause of GRBs, they are also associated with other events, such as the collision of neutron stars.  These mergers can also produce the intense energy release characteristic of GRBs.  Therefore, GRBs are not solely caused by black hole formation.


**11. With reference to  Quasi-Moons, consider the following statements:**

1. A quasi-moon, or quasi-satellite, is a celestial body that orbits the Sun in a similar timeframe to a planet, but is only slightly influenced by that planet's gravitational pull.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A quasi-moon is a small celestial body that maintains a relatively stable orbital relationship with a planet, orbiting the Sun in roughly the same time as the planet, but without being a true satellite (i.e., directly orbiting the planet). The gravitational influence of the planet is relatively weak. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While 2023 FW13 is considered a quasi-moon, it doesn't orbit Earth closely.  It orbits the Sun, with its orbit only slightly perturbed by Earth's gravity.  It's more accurate to say it has a quasi-stable orbital resonance with Earth. Statement 3 is incorrect. While quasi-moons are relatively rare, their existence is not limited to our solar system.  They are likely to be present around other planets in other star systems, though their detection is challenging.


**12. With reference to  Zero Shadow Day, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Zero Shadow Day is a phenomenon where the Sun is directly overhead, resulting in vertical objects casting no shadow at that specific location and time.  The Sun's angle relative to the observer is 90 degrees. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Zero Shadow Day occurs for locations *between* the tropics (Cancer and Capricorn), not just at the equator.  The latitude of the location determines the dates on which this phenomenon occurs. Statement 3 is correct. The apparent movement of the Sun north and south throughout the year, due to Earth's tilt on its axis, is the cause of Zero Shadow Day.  As the Sun crosses the local zenith (directly overhead), the shadow disappears.

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) in Hanle, Ladakh, has indeed observed the brightening of BL Lacertae (BL Lac), a well-known blazar.  This observation highlights the IAO's capabilities in monitoring variable celestial objects. Statement 2 is also correct. A blazar is a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy.  These objects are characterized by their intense emission of highly energetic particles and radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Statement 3 is incorrect. Blazars are actually among the brightest and most powerful objects in the universe. Their luminosity is due to relativistic jets of particles emanating from the central black hole, which are directed nearly towards Earth.  This orientation enhances their observed brightness.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  POEM-2 utilizes the *spent fourth stage* (PS4) of the PSLV rocket, not the first stage, as an orbital platform for conducting scientific experiments. The fourth stage is left in orbit after the main mission's payload deployment.

Statement 2 is correct. POEM-2 is indeed an ISRO mission, showcasing India's innovative approach to utilizing spent rocket stages for further scientific endeavors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. POEM-2 deploys its experimental payload into a *low Earth orbit*, not a geostationary orbit. Geostationary orbits are much higher and require significantly more energy to achieve.  The PS4 stage is left in a low Earth orbit suitable for conducting experiments.



**1. With reference to methanol, consider the following statements:**

1. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, is a colorless, volatile liquid with a pungent odor, completely miscible with water.
2. Methanol exposure can lead to severe health consequences, including nausea, coma, seizures, blindness, and death.
3. The treatment for methanol poisoning involves administering ethanol or an antidote called fomepizole.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe methanol.  Statement 1 correctly identifies methanol's physical properties: it is indeed a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic pungent, slightly sweet odor and is completely miscible with water. Statement 2 accurately reflects the serious health risks associated with methanol exposure.  Methanol is toxic because the body metabolizes it into formaldehyde and formic acid, which are highly damaging to the central nervous system, eyes, and other organs.  The symptoms listed are consistent with methanol poisoning, ranging from mild nausea to life-threatening conditions like coma and death.  Statement 3 correctly describes the treatment approach.  Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor, slowing down the metabolism of methanol, allowing the body to excrete it more readily. Fomepizole is another effective antidote that works similarly. Therefore, all three statements are accurate and the correct option is (c).


**2. With reference to the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Glycemic Index ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose having a GI of 100.
2.  Foods with a high GI cause rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels, potentially straining insulin production or utilization.
3.  Glycemic Load (GL) considers only the GI of a food and not the amount of carbohydrates in a serving.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the Glycemic Index and its scale.  The GI measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels after consumption.  Pure glucose serves as the reference point (GI of 100). Statement 2 correctly explains the health implications of high GI foods, especially for individuals with diabetes.  Rapid spikes in blood sugar levels can overwhelm the body's ability to produce or effectively use insulin, leading to various health complications.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive measure than GI. While GI reflects the speed of glucose absorption, GL accounts for both the GI and the total amount of carbohydrates in a serving.  This makes GL a better indicator of the overall impact of a food on blood sugar levels. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza is caused by avian influenza Type B viruses.
2.  HPAI viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry, while LPAI viruses cause only mild disease.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Avian influenza is caused by Type A influenza viruses, not Type B.  Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. Statement 2 accurately describes the difference between highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. HPAI viruses cause severe disease and high mortality rates in poultry, leading to significant economic losses and public health concerns.  LPAI viruses, in contrast, cause milder forms of the disease.  Statement 3 is correct. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), formerly known as the Office International des Epizooties (OIE), is a crucial intergovernmental organization dedicated to improving animal health worldwide.  It has 183 member countries, including India, and plays a vital role in coordinating global responses to animal diseases, including avian influenza. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4.  With reference to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that does *not* use ionizing radiation. This is a key advantage over techniques like X-rays and CT scans. Statement 2 accurately describes the fundamental principles of MRI. It uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to interact with the hydrogen atoms in the body.  These interactions produce signals that are then processed by a computer to generate detailed cross-sectional images of internal structures.  Statement 3 correctly mentions Iseult and its application. Iseult's high power allows for unprecedented detail in brain imaging, potentially leading to breakthroughs in understanding brain anatomy and various neurological conditions.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**5. With reference to  Ethylene and Liquid Nitrogen in food processing, consider the following statements:**

1. FSSAI permits the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening of fruits, provided the concentration does not exceed 100 ppm.
2. Liquid nitrogen, a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, non-corrosive cryogenic fluid, is used for freezing and transporting food products.
3.  Exposure to liquid nitrogen can cause cold burns and frostbite due to its extremely low temperature (-196 °C).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the FSSAI guidelines on ethylene use.  Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that accelerates ripening, and its controlled use is permitted for this purpose within specified limits.  Excessive use is harmful. Statement 2 correctly describes liquid nitrogen's properties and applications in food processing. Its extremely low temperature makes it ideal for rapid freezing, which helps preserve food quality and extend shelf life during transport.  Statement 3 also accurately points out the risks associated with liquid nitrogen handling. Direct contact with liquid nitrogen can cause severe cold burns (frostbite) due to its extremely low temperature, which rapidly freezes skin and other tissues.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**6. With reference to  Biofuels, consider the following statements:**

1. Biodiesel is produced through the process of fermentation, where vegetable oils or animal fats are converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).
2. Ethanol, produced through fermentation, is a less energy-dense fuel compared to petrol but offers a renewable alternative.
3. Hydrogen, a clean alternative to fossil fuels, is easily and cheaply extracted from water through electrolysis using renewable energy.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Biodiesel production uses transesterification, not fermentation.  Transesterification is a chemical process where vegetable oils or animal fats react with an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce FAMEs (biodiesel) and glycerol.  Fermentation is used in ethanol production. Statement 2 is correct. Ethanol, a biofuel produced via fermentation of sugars, has a lower energy density than petrol (gasoline). However, its renewable source and reduced greenhouse gas emissions make it a valuable alternative fuel.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While hydrogen is a clean fuel and its production via electrolysis using renewable energy is environmentally beneficial ("green" hydrogen), the process is currently energy-intensive and expensive.  The cost of renewable energy sources and the efficiency of the electrolysis process significantly impact the overall cost of hydrogen production.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**7. With reference to  Antimatter, consider the following statements:**

1. Antimatter was first theorised by Albert Einstein in 1928 during his work on quantum mechanics.
2.  When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate each other, releasing energy.
3.  Particle accelerators, like those at CERN, are used to create antimatter, although the total artificial production remains limited due to high costs and handling difficulties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Einstein's work was crucial to the understanding of matter and energy, the theoretical existence of antimatter was first proposed by Paul Dirac in 1928, not Albert Einstein. Dirac's equation predicted the existence of antiparticles, which were later confirmed experimentally. Statement 2 is correct. The annihilation of matter and antimatter is a fundamental principle of physics. When a particle and its antiparticle collide, they completely annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  Statement 3 accurately describes the current state of antimatter production.  High-energy particle colliders, such as those at CERN, can produce antimatter by smashing particles together.  However, the process is extremely energy-intensive, making large-scale antimatter production economically unfeasible and technologically challenging at present. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**8. With reference to  Indian Space Launch Vehicles, consider the following statements:**

1. The PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) mission utilizes the spent PS4 stage of the GSLV Mk III launch vehicle as an orbital platform.
2. The CE-20 cryogenic engine, developed by LPSC, will power the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle for the Gaganyaan mission.
3. The Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE-200) uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) as propellants and is designed for ISRO's existing LVM3 and upcoming heavy-lift launch vehicles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  POEM-2 uses the spent fourth stage (PS4) of the *PSLV* (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle), not the GSLV Mk III.  The PS4 stage is repurposed as a platform for in-orbit experiments. Statement 2 is correct. The CE-20 cryogenic engine, developed by the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) of ISRO, is indeed designed to power the upper stage of the LVM3 (formerly GSLV Mk III) launch vehicle for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight mission. Statement 3 is incorrect. The SCE-200 uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 kerosene (a type of refined petroleum), not liquid hydrogen (LH2), as propellants.  The use of kerosene makes it a semi-cryogenic engine, unlike fully cryogenic engines that utilize LH2. Therefore, only statements 2 is fully correct and statement 1 is partially correct.


**9. With reference to Solar Phenomena, consider the following statements:**

1. Solar flares are intense, localized emissions of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's core, often accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
2. Solar winds are continuous streams of charged particles emanating from the Sun's corona, primarily consisting of electrons, protons, and alpha particles.
3. Solar flares are classified according to their strength (A, B, C, M, X classes), with each letter representing a 10-fold increase in energy output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. Solar flares originate in the Sun's atmosphere (corona and chromosphere), not its core. The core is where nuclear fusion occurs.  While solar flares are indeed intense emissions of electromagnetic radiation and are often associated with CMEs, their origin is not the Sun's core. Statement 2 is correct.  Solar winds are a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, primarily composed of electrons, protons, and alpha particles. These winds travel at high speeds throughout the solar system and interact with planetary magnetospheres.  Statement 3 is also correct. The classification of solar flares based on their X-ray flux (A, B, C, M, X classes) is widely used in solar physics. Each letter class represents approximately a tenfold increase in energy output, with X-class flares being the most powerful.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully correct.


**10. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1. Genome editing techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to alter the DNA of organisms, including plants, to improve their traits or mitigate diseases.
2. SDN 1 and SDN 2 genome editing techniques involve the use of alien genetic material, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
3.  The development of low-pungent mustard using CRISPR/Cas9 technology involved reducing the glucosinolate content to levels comparable to canola.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Genome editing tools like CRISPR-Cas9 allow for precise modifications to an organism's DNA. This can be applied to plants to enhance desirable traits (e.g., yield, disease resistance) or to reduce undesirable ones (e.g., pungency in mustard). Statement 2 is incorrect. SDN 1 and SDN 2 do *not* involve the introduction of alien genetic material.  They only modify existing DNA sequences within the organism.  SDN 3, on the other hand, does involve the transfer of genes from another species.  Statement 3 is correct. The development of the low-pungent mustard variety used CRISPR-Cas9 to reduce glucosinolate levels, a compound responsible for the plant's pungency, to levels comparable to canola, making it suitable for wider consumption and animal feed.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

3.  SDN3 genome editing exclusively utilizes genes of foreign origin, unlike SDN1 and SDN2, which are indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Indian scientists successfully created a low-pungent mustard variety by employing CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing on the 'Varuna' mustard variety.  This significantly reduced glucosinolate levels, bringing them down to canola standards.

Statement 2 is also correct. Genome editing fundamentally involves altering an organism's DNA sequence using SDNs.  These nucleases can introduce various changes—deletions, substitutions, or additions of nucleotides—to achieve the desired genetic modification.  Crucially, the distinction between SDN1 and SDN2 and SDN3 lies in the use of foreign genetic material.  SDN1 and SDN2 methods do not incorporate foreign DNA, resulting in a final product genetically similar to conventionally bred varieties.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While SDN3 does involve foreign genetic material, it's inaccurate to state that *only* SDN3 utilizes foreign genes. The description of SDN1 and SDN2 is partially correct but incomplete. It's more accurate to say that SDN1 and SDN2 do not introduce *detectable* foreign genetic material, whereas SDN3 does. The key difference lies in the traceability and detectability of the introduced genetic material, not its exclusive presence in SDN3.  The final product of SDN1 and SDN2 methods might still contain foreign genetic material that cannot be easily detected using current techniques.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. mRNA vaccines introduce a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule encoding for a specific viral protein (antigen) into cells.  The cells then translate this mRNA into the corresponding protein, which is presented to the immune system.  This harmless antigen triggers an immune response, preparing the body to fight off the actual virus if encountered later.  The mRNA itself is typically degraded shortly after it has been translated.

Statement 2 is also correct. Unlike traditional vaccines, which utilize weakened or inactivated pathogens, mRNA vaccines use only the mRNA molecule carrying the genetic instructions for the antigen.  This method avoids the risks associated with using live or attenuated pathogens.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While mRNA vaccines are highly effective at generating a strong immune response, they typically do not provide lifelong immunity.  Booster shots are often necessary to maintain protection over time, as the level of antibodies produced by the initial vaccination can wane.  The duration of immunity can vary depending on factors such as the vaccine itself, the individual's immune response, and the nature of the pathogen.

2.  High GI foods can cause rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels, potentially straining the body's insulin production and utilization, posing particular challenges for individuals with diabetes.
3.  Glycemic Load (GL) considers only the GI of a food, disregarding the amount of carbohydrates in a serving.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Glycemic Index uses pure glucose (not sucrose) as the reference point, with a GI of 100. Sucrose has a lower GI. Statement 2 is correct. High GI foods lead to rapid increases in blood glucose levels, which can be problematic for individuals with diabetes because their bodies may struggle to produce or effectively utilize sufficient insulin to regulate these spikes. This can lead to various health complications.  Statement 3 is incorrect. Glycemic Load (GL) takes into account both the GI of a food *and* the amount of carbohydrates in a serving.  This provides a more comprehensive measure of a food's impact on blood sugar levels compared to GI alone, since a food might have a high GI but a low carbohydrate content per serving.

Collisions with even small pieces of debris can cause significant damage, potentially leading to satellite malfunction or destruction.  The increasing amount of space debris is a growing concern for the sustainability of space activities. Statement 2 is incorrect. Solar radiation has a substantial impact on satellites.  Prolonged exposure to solar radiation can degrade satellite materials, affecting their performance and lifespan.  This includes damage to solar panels, thermal control systems, and electronic components.  Satellites are designed to mitigate these effects, but they are not immune. Statement 3 is incorrect. Micrometeoroid impacts, although less frequent than other threats, can cause significant damage to satellites.  These small particles traveling at high velocities can penetrate satellite shielding, leading to equipment failures or even complete satellite failure.  Satellite design incorporates measures to minimize the impact of micrometeoroids, but it remains a potential hazard.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While methanol is indeed known as wood alcohol, it's crucial to note that it is *completely miscible* with water, meaning it dissolves readily in water. This miscibility is important for its various applications and also relevant to its toxicity.  The statement falsely claims it is immiscible.

Statement 2 is correct. Methanol serves as a crucial building block in the chemical industry, finding applications as a solvent and precursor in the synthesis of a wide range of products, including synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.

Statement 3 is correct. In cases of methanol poisoning, the standard treatment involves administering ethanol (which competes with methanol for the same metabolic enzyme, reducing methanol's toxic effects) or an antidote called fomepizole, which inhibits the enzyme responsible for converting methanol into its toxic metabolites.


**3. With reference to the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Glycemic Index ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100, based on their ability to raise blood sugar levels compared to sucrose, which has a GI of 100.
2.  The Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates in a food serving to estimate the blood sugar rise after consumption.
3.  High GI foods are associated with increased risks of type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, while low GI foods are generally considered healthier for these conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The reference point for the Glycemic Index is *pure glucose*, not sucrose, which has a GI of 100.  Glucose is used because it represents the fastest and most significant rise in blood sugar.  Sucrose, being a disaccharide (composed of glucose and fructose), would have a lower GI than glucose.

Statement 2 is correct. The Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive measure than GI alone, as it accounts for both the speed of blood sugar elevation (GI) and the quantity of carbohydrates consumed in a particular serving size. This provides a more realistic assessment of a food's impact on blood glucose levels.

Statement 3 is correct.  Numerous studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between diets high in high-GI foods and increased risks of type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. High GI foods cause rapid spikes in blood sugar, potentially overwhelming the body's insulin response and contributing to long-term health complications.  Low GI foods lead to more gradual and controlled blood sugar increases, promoting better metabolic health.


**4. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza is caused by infection with avian influenza Type B viruses, which are divided into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
2. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry.
3. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) is an international organization that collaborates to improve animal health, with India as one of its member countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Avian influenza is caused by *Type A*, not Type B, avian influenza viruses.  The classification into subtypes based on H and N proteins is accurate, but the virus type is misstated.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  *Highly pathogenic avian influenza* (HPAI) viruses, not LPAI viruses, cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry. LPAI viruses often cause mild or no symptoms.  The statement incorrectly attributes the severe effects to LPAI.

Statement 3 is correct. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), formerly known as the OIE (Office International des Epizooties), is indeed a vital international organization working to improve animal health globally, and India is a member.


**5. With reference to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, consider the following statements:**

2. The magnetic field inside an MRI machine interacts with radio waves and hydrogen atoms in the body to generate cross-sectional images.
3. Iseult, one of the world's most powerful MRI machines, is capable of producing high-resolution images of the human brain, which can help in understanding brain anatomy and diseases.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MRI does *not* use X-rays.  It employs powerful magnets and radio waves to create images. X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation, while MRI is a non-ionizing imaging technique.

Statement 2 is correct. The fundamental principle of MRI relies on the interaction between a strong magnetic field, radio waves, and the hydrogen atoms present in the body's tissues.  The signals emitted by these atoms are then processed to generate detailed cross-sectional images.

Statement 3 is correct. Iseult is indeed a highly advanced MRI machine known for its capability to produce exceptionally detailed images of the brain, offering significant advancements in the study of brain anatomy and various neurological diseases.


**6. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1. Genome editing uses site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to make changes in an organism's DNA, which may include small deletions, substitutions, or additions of nucleotides.
2.  SDN-1 and SDN-2 processes involve alien genetic material, while the SDN-3 process does not.
3. Unlike Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), gene editing modifies existing genetic material, not introducing foreign genes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Genome editing techniques utilize site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to precisely target specific locations within an organism's DNA.  These nucleases create double-strand breaks, allowing for the insertion, deletion, or modification of DNA sequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. SDN-1 and SDN-2 processes do *not* involve alien genetic material; they modify the existing DNA within the organism.  It is SDN-3 that involves the introduction of foreign genetic material.  The statement reverses this crucial distinction.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key difference between gene editing and GMO technology lies in the approach. Gene editing modifies existing genes within the organism's genome, whereas GMOs introduce entirely new genes (transgenes) from other species.


**7. With reference to Gene Drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. GDT is a genetic engineering technique that modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, increasing the likelihood that specific genes will be passed on to the next generation.
2.  The three key components of a gene drive are a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (a molecular scissor), and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats).
3. GDT applications have shown promising results in reducing mosquito populations by making them produce sterile offspring, but it also carries potential risks to non-target species.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gene drive technology aims to override the natural inheritance patterns (Mendelian inheritance) by artificially increasing the probability of a specific gene being inherited by offspring. This can be used to spread desirable traits or suppress undesirable ones within a population.

Statement 2 is correct. The core components of a typical gene drive system include a gene of interest, the Cas9 enzyme (which acts as a molecular "scissors" to cut DNA), and CRISPR technology (which guides the Cas9 enzyme to the target DNA sequence).

Statement 3 is correct.  Gene drive technology holds significant promise for controlling populations of disease-carrying organisms, such as mosquitoes.  While initial trials have shown success in reducing mosquito populations by inducing sterility, there are significant concerns about potential unintended consequences, including the impact on non-target species and the long-term ecological effects.

3. The mission includes providing financial assistance for bone marrow transplants, the only cure for sickle cell anaemia.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The target year for elimination is 2047, not 2030. The three-pillar strategy (health promotion, prevention, and management) is accurate.  The timeframe is the key error.

Statement 2 is correct. The mission's initial focus is on the 0-18 age group, with plans to expand coverage to the 0-40 age group in a phased manner. This reflects a strategic approach to addressing the disease's impact across different age ranges.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While bone marrow transplants are a potential cure, the mission doesn't explicitly guarantee financial assistance for this expensive procedure for everyone.  The mission is likely to focus on more widely accessible and affordable interventions.


**9. With reference to the sources and methods of Hydrogen production, consider the following statements:**

1. "Grey" hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage (CCS), while "green" hydrogen is produced via electrolysis of water using renewable energy.
2. Steam methane reforming (SMR) is a hydrocarbon-based method that produces synthesis gas, and further processing generates hydrogen with minimal CO2 emissions.
3. Electrolysis is a water-based method that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, generating "blue" hydrogen when using renewable energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The terminology for hydrogen production methods reflects the environmental impact. "Grey" hydrogen uses fossil fuels without capturing CO2 emissions, resulting in a high carbon footprint.  "Green" hydrogen, on the other hand, is produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources, resulting in minimal or zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SMR is a significant source of CO2 emissions.  The statement falsely implies minimal CO2 emissions.  CCS is necessary to reduce emissions from SMR.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Electrolysis using renewable energy produces *green* hydrogen, not "blue" hydrogen. "Blue" hydrogen is produced via SMR, but with carbon capture and storage, reducing but not eliminating CO2 emissions.  The statement mismatches the color coding for hydrogen production methods.


**10. With reference to Battery Technologies, consider the following statements:**

1. Lithium-ion batteries are favored for their high energy density and low self-discharge rate, but they also pose safety concerns related to flammability and thermal runaway.

3. Sand batteries store energy as heat using excess renewable energy, and they are primarily used in applications requiring thermal energy storage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Lithium-ion batteries are widely used due to their high energy density (meaning they can store a lot of energy in a small space) and low self-discharge rate (they don't lose charge quickly when not in use). However, the use of flammable electrolytes and the potential for thermal runaway (a chain reaction that leads to overheating and fire) remain significant safety concerns.

Statement 2 is correct. Sodium-ion batteries are being developed as a potential alternative to lithium-ion due to the greater abundance and lower cost of sodium.  However, current sodium-ion technology generally has a lower energy density compared to lithium-ion.

Statement 3 is correct.  Sand batteries represent a novel approach to thermal energy storage. They utilize the heat capacity of sand to store excess renewable energy as heat, which can then be released later for heating purposes.  Their primary application is in thermal energy storage systems.

3.  Time dilation, a consequence of Einstein's theory of relativity, is more pronounced near black holes due to their extremely strong gravitational fields, causing time to pass slower for observers closer to the black hole.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately describe aspects of black holes.  Statement 1 correctly distinguishes between supermassive and stellar black holes, highlighting their differing origins and immense size differences.  Supermassive black holes reside at galactic centers and possess masses millions or even billions of times greater than the Sun, while stellar black holes are formed from the gravitational collapse of individual massive stars. Statement 2 accurately defines the Schwarzschild radius as the radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating black hole. This radius marks the point of no return, beyond which the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape, including light.  Statement 3 correctly explains time dilation near black holes as a consequence of Einstein's theory of relativity. The extreme gravitational fields of black holes cause spacetime curvature, leading to significant time dilation effects, where time slows down for observers closer to the black hole relative to those farther away. These statements represent well-established concepts in astrophysics.

Statement 1 is correct. The chromosphere's temperature gradient, ranging from roughly 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top, is a well-established characteristic of this solar atmospheric layer.  This temperature increase is crucial for understanding energy transport within the Sun.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Sunspots and coronal holes are both darker and cooler than their surroundings, but their magnetic field configurations differ significantly. Sunspots possess intensely strong, tangled magnetic fields, leading to their characteristic appearance and activity. In contrast, coronal holes are characterized by open, unipolar magnetic fields, allowing the escape of solar wind plasma.  This distinction is a key aspect of solar physics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While solar prominences are indeed large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface into the corona, their formation timescale is typically on the order of *days*, not weeks. This shorter formation period highlights their dynamic nature and connection to other solar phenomena.  The error in the statement represents a significant deviation from established knowledge.


**2. With reference to the Gaganyaan mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gaganyaan mission utilizes the LVM3 launch vehicle, comprising solid, liquid, and cryogenic stages, to deploy a crew of three astronauts into a 400 km orbit for a 3-day mission.
2. ISRO's indigenously developed Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a critical component of the Gaganyaan spacecraft, ensuring crew survivability in space.
3. The CE-20 cryogenic engine, employed in the Gaganyaan mission, is a semi-cryogenic engine using refined kerosene and liquid oxygen as propellants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The LVM3 rocket, with its three-stage propulsion system, is the chosen launch vehicle for Gaganyaan.  The mission parameters—a crew of three, a 400 km orbit, and a 3-day duration—are also correct. This highlights India's ambition and technological capabilities in human spaceflight.

Statement 2 is also correct.  ISRO's successful development and integration of the ECLSS system demonstrate a significant advancement in India's space technology. The ECLSS is essential for maintaining a habitable environment within the spacecraft, ensuring crew safety and well-being.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CE-20 engine is indeed a key element of the Gaganyaan mission, but it's a *cryogenic* engine, not semi-cryogenic. Cryogenic engines use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, offering higher performance compared to semi-cryogenic variants that use refined kerosene.  The confusion between cryogenic and semi-cryogenic represents a crucial detail for understanding the technological sophistication of the mission.


**3. With reference to NavIC and related navigation systems, consider the following statements:**

1. NavIC, previously known as IRNSS, offers both Standard Position Service (SPS) for civilian users and Restricted Service (RS) for strategic users, providing positioning accuracy of 10 meters.
2.  GAGAN, a regional SBAS jointly developed by ISRO and AAI, enhances GPS accuracy for aircraft navigation over Indian airspace and adjoining regions, extending its coverage from Africa to Australia.
3. SAGAR SAMPARK, an indigenous DGNSS, corrects errors in GNSS signals by using a constellation of terrestrial-based augmentation systems to provide global coverage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NavIC's dual service provision (SPS and RS) and its advertised 10-meter positioning accuracy are accurate representations of its capabilities.  The previous name, IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System), is also historically accurate.  This demonstrates India's commitment to developing an independent navigation system.

Statement 2 is also correct. GAGAN's collaborative development, its purpose of augmenting GPS accuracy for aviation, and its broad regional coverage are all factually accurate. The description of its geographical reach underscores its significance in air navigation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While SAGAR SAMPARK is indeed an indigenous DGNSS aimed at improving GNSS accuracy, it utilizes *terrestrial-based* augmentation, not a constellation of such systems.  Furthermore, DGNSS systems generally provide regional, not global, coverage. The statement incorrectly attributes global coverage to a regional system.


**4. With reference to gravitational waves, consider the following statements:**

1. Gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, are ripples in spacetime caused by extremely energetic cosmic events like black hole mergers and neutron star collisions.
2. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves for the first time in 2015, primarily from mergers of supermassive black holes.
3.  Higher-frequency gravitational waves are thought to originate from smaller pairs of black holes, while lower-frequency waves are associated with mergers of supermassive black holes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Einstein's prediction and the description of gravitational waves as spacetime ripples generated by cataclysmic events are fundamental concepts in astrophysics. The examples given—black hole and neutron star mergers—are well-established sources of these waves.

Statement 3 is also correct. The frequency of gravitational waves is directly related to the mass and orbital speed of the objects that generate them. Smaller black hole mergers produce higher-frequency waves, while supermassive black hole mergers generate lower-frequency waves. This relationship is essential for understanding the different types of sources of gravitational waves.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While LIGO's 2015 detection was a landmark achievement, the initial detection was from the merger of *stellar-mass* black holes, not supermassive black holes. Supermassive black hole mergers produce gravitational waves in a lower frequency range, requiring different detection techniques.  The misidentification of the source of LIGO's first detection is a significant factual error.



**5. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consider the following statements:**

1. The JWST, a collaborative project involving NASA, ESA, and CSA, operates primarily in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to observe phenomena invisible to the Hubble Space Telescope.
2.  Positioned in an L2 orbit, the JWST maintains a stable alignment with Earth, shielding its instruments from the Sun's heat and light via a large sunshield.
3. The JWST's larger mirror (6.5 meters) compared to Hubble's (2.4 meters) enables significantly improved sensitivity and resolution, allowing it to observe "toddler galaxies" formed shortly after the Big Bang.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The JWST's primary operational wavelength range is in the infrared, a crucial differentiator from the Hubble which operates mainly in visible and ultraviolet light. This infrared capability allows the JWST to peer through cosmic dust and observe objects that are too distant or obscured for Hubble.

Statement 2 is also correct. The L2 Lagrangian point is strategically chosen for its gravitational stability and its ability to keep the telescope shielded from the Sun, Earth, and Moon.  The large sunshield is vital for maintaining the extremely low temperatures required for infrared observations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The JWST's enhanced capabilities *do* allow it to observe galaxies formed much earlier in the universe than Hubble can, but the statement incorrectly attributes this to observing "toddler galaxies."  The JWST’s improved resolution allows it to see much *farther* back in time, to observe galaxies that formed closer to the Big Bang, often referred to as "baby galaxies," not toddler galaxies.  This represents a subtle but important distinction in cosmological terminology.


**1. With reference to gene silencing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Dicer is an enzyme that cleaves long double-stranded RNA molecules into short double-stranded fragments called microRNAs (miRNAs).
2.  RNA interference (RNAi) uses small RNA molecules to target and degrade specific mRNA molecules, preventing their translation into proteins.
3.  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are translated into proteins and play a crucial role in gene silencing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Dicer does cleave long double-stranded RNA molecules into short fragments, but these are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), not microRNAs (miRNAs).  miRNAs are also short non-coding RNAs, but they are distinct from siRNAs in their origin and mechanism of action.  While both participate in RNA interference, siRNAs are generally exogenous (introduced from outside the cell), whereas miRNAs are endogenous (produced within the cell). The question plays on this subtle difference to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process and a powerful tool used in gene silencing. It involves the introduction of small RNA molecules (siRNAs or miRNAs) that target and bind to complementary mRNA sequences. This binding triggers the degradation of the mRNA molecule, preventing protein synthesis.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are, by definition, *not* translated into proteins. They are involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation, but their mechanism of action in gene silencing differs from that of siRNAs or miRNAs. They primarily regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, often by interacting with chromatin or other regulatory molecules. The statement incorrectly attributes protein translation to lncRNAs, a key misconception for those not fully grasping the nuances of non-coding RNA functions.


**2. With reference to types of DNA, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a linear DNA molecule found within mitochondria and is inherited paternally.
2.  Circular DNA is found only in bacteria and plasmids.
3.  Microsatellite DNA consists of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences (1-6 base pairs) found throughout the genome and exhibits high variability in the number of repeats between individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While mtDNA is indeed found within mitochondria, it is a *circular*, not linear, DNA molecule.  More importantly, mtDNA is inherited *maternally*, not paternally.  This is a crucial point often tested in UPSC-style questions, highlighting the importance of understanding the specifics of organelle inheritance. The statement uses the correct organelle but flips the inheritance pattern to confuse the candidate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although circular DNA is abundant in bacteria and plasmids, it's also found in other locations, such as the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells.  Restricting its presence to only bacteria and plasmids is a significant oversimplification, making the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct. Microsatellite DNA accurately describes short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences (1-6 base pairs) scattered throughout the genome.  The high variability in the number of repeats between individuals makes them valuable markers in population genetics and forensic science.  This statement provides a precise and accurate description of a specific type of DNA, contrasting with the inaccurate or incomplete information in the other statements.


**3. With reference to the components involved in DNA to RNA translation, consider the following statements:**

1.  RNA polymerase is the enzyme that synthesizes DNA from the RNA template during transcription.
2.  tRNA (transfer RNA) carries amino acids to the ribosome during translation.
3.  Ribosomes are cellular structures composed solely of RNA molecules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA from a *DNA* template, not the other way around. The process described is transcription, the first step in gene expression.  The statement reverses the template and product, a common error in understanding the central dogma of molecular biology.

Statement 2 is correct. tRNA molecules are crucial in translation. Each tRNA molecule carries a specific amino acid and has an anticodon that recognizes a complementary codon on the mRNA molecule.  This ensures the correct amino acid sequence during protein synthesis.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Ribosomes are complex structures composed of both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins.  They are the sites of protein synthesis, where the mRNA sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence.  The statement omits the crucial protein component of ribosomes, a fundamental fact about their structure and function.


**4. With reference to jumping genes (transposable elements), consider the following statements:**

1.  Jumping genes were discovered by Barbara McClintock in the 1950s through her work on fruit flies.
2.  Retrotransposons replicate themselves using a "copy-and-paste" mechanism, creating a copy that inserts into a new genomic location.
3.  The activity of jumping genes is completely unregulated and often leads to harmful mutations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Barbara McClintock did discover jumping genes (transposable elements), she did so in the 1940s, not the 1950s, through her work on corn (maize), not fruit flies.  This statement is factually incorrect in both the timeframe and the organism studied.

Statement 2 is correct.  Retrotransposons are a class of transposable elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate.  They use a "copy-and-paste" mechanism, meaning they create a copy of themselves and insert that copy into a new genomic location. The original element remains in its original location.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the transposition of jumping genes can sometimes lead to harmful mutations, their activity is usually tightly regulated by cellular mechanisms. These regulatory mechanisms help to prevent excessive or uncontrolled transposition that would be detrimental to the organism.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and inaccurate view of the regulation of transposable elements.


**5. With reference to epigenetics, consider the following statements:**

1.  Epigenetics involves changes in the DNA sequence that are heritable.
2.  DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can lead to gene activation.
3.  Histone modifications affect chromatin structure and can influence gene expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Epigenetics involves heritable changes in gene *expression*, not changes in the underlying DNA sequence itself.  Epigenetic modifications alter how genes are expressed without changing the DNA sequence. The statement confuses epigenetic changes with genetic mutations.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. DNA methylation *can* lead to gene silencing (suppression), not activation.  While there are exceptions and complexities, the primary effect of DNA methylation is to repress gene expression by altering chromatin structure and preventing transcription factors from accessing the DNA. The statement presents a simplified and potentially incorrect view of DNA methylation's effects.

Statement 3 is correct. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, directly alter chromatin structure.  Changes in chromatin structure can affect the accessibility of DNA to the transcriptional machinery, thus influencing gene expression. This statement accurately describes a key mechanism of epigenetic regulation.


**6. With reference to gene therapy, consider the following statements:**

1.  Germline gene therapy modifies germline cells (egg or sperm) and the modifications are inherited by future generations. This is legal in India.
2.  Somatic cell gene therapy transfers therapeutic genes to somatic cells (cells other than germline cells). Modifications are not inherited.
3.  The National Guidelines for GTP Development and Clinical Trials (2019) specifies ethical, scientific, and regulatory procedures for conducting clinical trials on gene therapy products (GTP) in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Germline gene therapy does modify germline cells, resulting in heritable changes. However, it is *illegal* in India due to significant ethical concerns about altering the human germline. The statement correctly describes germline therapy but gets the legality in India wrong.

Statement 2 is correct. Somatic cell gene therapy targets somatic cells, and any genetic modifications are confined to the individual patient and are not passed on to offspring. This is a key distinction from germline therapy.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Guidelines for GTP Development and Clinical Trials (2019), issued by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and ICMR, establish the ethical, scientific, and regulatory framework for gene therapy clinical trials in India.  This statement accurately points to a crucial regulatory aspect of gene therapy in India.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India AI mission aims to deploy over 10,000 GPUs, not 5000. The question uses a number close to the actual figure but not the correct one, creating a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While MeitY is the overseeing ministry, the implementing agency is 'IndiaAI', an Independent Business Division under Digital India Corporation. The question misrepresents the implementing agency.

Statement 3 is correct. The IAIC and the India AI Datasets Platform are indeed key components of the mission.


**9. With reference to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is incorrect. The concept of "smart factories" is a central aspect of 4IR, representing the integration of physical and digital systems in manufacturing environments. The statement incorrectly claims a lack of connection.

Statement 3 is correct. Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), is credited with popularizing and defining the term "Fourth Industrial Revolution."


**10. With reference to Methanol, consider the following statements:**

1. Methanol (CH3OH), also known as methyl alcohol, is a colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent odor.
2. Methanol is completely immiscible with water and is considered an alternative fuel.
3. Treatment of methanol poisoning involves administering ethanol or an antidote called fomepizole.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct, but it's important to note that while methanol is colorless and has a pungent odor, the description should state that it is *flammable*, not just "flammable liquid" to be precise.  The term 'pungent' is also subjective.  The question tests the precise properties of methanol.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Methanol is, in fact, completely *miscible* (mixable) with water.  This is a key chemical property that distinguishes it from many other organic solvents. The statement contradicts a fundamental chemical property.

Statement 3 is correct.  Ethanol and fomepizole are indeed used in the treatment of methanol poisoning. Ethanol acts as a competitive inhibitor, slowing down the metabolism of methanol, while fomepizole is a specific antidote.


**11. With reference to Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how slowly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood sugar levels after consumption.
2.  The Glycemic Load (GL) uses GI and the amount of total carbohydrates in a serving of food to estimate how much blood sugar will rise after consumption.
3.  Diets rich in high-GI foods are associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Glycemic Index (GI) measures how *quickly*, not slowly, a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood sugar levels. The statement misrepresents the fundamental concept of GI.

Statement 2 is correct.  Glycemic Load (GL) combines GI with the amount of carbohydrates in a serving to provide a more comprehensive assessment of a food's impact on blood glucose.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Diets rich in high-GI foods are associated with an *increased*, not reduced, risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases due to the rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels. The statement directly contradicts the established link between high-GI diets and health risks.


**12. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1.  Avian influenza is caused by infection with avian influenza Type B viruses.
2.  Avian influenza A viruses are classified into LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) and HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) viruses.
3.  Vaccination against HPAI is permitted in India to control outbreaks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

1.  MRI uses X-rays to produce detailed images of internal structures.
2.  MRI uses a large magnet and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the body.
3.  Ionizing radiation is produced during an MRI exam, unlike X-rays.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MRI does *not* use X-rays. It employs a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate images.  This is a critical distinction between MRI and other imaging techniques like X-rays and CT scans.

Statement 2 is correct.  MRI utilizes a powerful magnet and radio waves to interact with hydrogen atoms in the body, creating detailed cross-sectional images.

Statement 3 is incorrect. MRI does *not* produce ionizing radiation.  This is a key advantage of MRI over techniques that use X-rays or other ionizing radiation sources.  The statement incorrectly attributes radiation production to MRI.


**14. With reference to  Haemophilia, consider the following statements:**

1. Haemophilia is an acquired, life-long bleeding disorder occurring predominantly in females.
2. Haemophilia A is due to a lack or decrease of clotting factor IX.
