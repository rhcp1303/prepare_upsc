(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While white phosphorus does have applications in fertilizers and some cleaning compounds, the statement is fundamentally wrong in classifying it as a chemical weapon under the CWC.  The CWC specifically targets chemical agents used for their toxic effects on living organisms. White phosphorus acts primarily as an incendiary agent, causing burns through heat and not primarily through a chemical reaction interfering with biological processes.  Therefore, it is not regulated under the CWC in the same way as nerve agents or blister agents would be.

Statement 2 is correct.  The use of white phosphorus munitions is a complex issue.  While not banned outright, international humanitarian law considers the use of white phosphorus in populated areas a war crime due to its severe incendiary effects.  The resulting burns are exceptionally painful and can be life-threatening, and the potential for systemic toxicity adds to the severity of its impact on civilian populations.  International law emphasizes the need to protect civilians in armed conflict, and the indiscriminate use of white phosphorus in populated areas directly violates this principle.

2. The Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method for growing diamonds involves depositing carbon atoms onto a diamond seed in a plasma environment, resulting in the formation of a layer-by-layer crystal structure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the HPHT method is partially correct in that it involves subjecting a diamond seed to extreme pressure and temperature. However, it incorrectly states that this process occurs in a chamber *filled with carbon-rich gas*.  In the HPHT method, the carbon source is typically graphite, which is placed in direct contact with the seed under extreme conditions.  The carbon-rich gas is characteristic of the CVD method, not HPHT.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the CVD method accurately reflects the process.  In CVD, a diamond seed is placed in a reaction chamber containing a carbon-rich gas.  The gas is then converted into a plasma using high temperatures, and the carbon atoms from the plasma deposit layer by layer onto the seed, creating a diamond crystal.  This method offers precise control over the growth process, allowing for the creation of diamonds with specific properties and characteristics.


**8. With reference to Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs), consider the following statements:**

2.  ATTA is a highly sensitive technique employed in radiometric dating using Calcium-41, enabling precise measurement of this rare isotope and its decay products for dating significantly older materials.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Carbon-14 dating is indeed used for dating organic materials less than 50,000 years old, ATTA is not the primary technique employed for this purpose.  Traditional Carbon-14 dating methods, such as Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), are typically used. ATTA's high sensitivity makes it better suited for measuring trace amounts of isotopes like Calcium-41, which are far less abundant than Carbon-14.

Statement 2 is correct. ATTA's high sensitivity is specifically what makes it suitable for measuring the extremely low concentrations of Calcium-41 in samples.  This allows for precise determination of the ratio of Calcium-41 to its decay products, which is crucial for accurate age estimation of materials significantly older than the range accessible by Carbon-14 dating.  The ability of ATTA to detect such minute quantities of rare isotopes is a major breakthrough in extending the range of radiometric dating techniques.

2. The NCAP utilizes City Action Plans (CAPs) implemented by state governments and agencies, monitored through a portal called PRANA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement misrepresents the NCAP's target reduction in particulate matter.  The NCAP actually aims for a 40% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, not 20%, by 2025-26.  The 40% target reflects a significantly more ambitious goal to improve air quality in the designated cities.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NCAP's implementation relies heavily on City Action Plans (CAPs) developed and executed at the state and city levels, with active involvement from state governments and relevant agencies.  The PRANA portal serves as a crucial monitoring and tracking system to oversee the progress and effectiveness of these CAPs, providing a centralized platform for data collection and analysis.  This multi-level implementation and monitoring approach is a key aspect of the NCAP's strategy.

1. The Act amends the 1974 Water Act, applying only to states that have passed resolutions to adopt the amendments and introducing stricter penalties for violations.
2. The Act grants the central government greater authority over the nomination of State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) chairpersons and the exemption of industrial plants from obtaining consent for establishment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendment does indeed modify the 1974 Water Act, and its application initially hinges on the states' adoption through resolutions. This reflects a federal structure where the central government can propose changes but their implementation requires state-level assent.  The Act also introduces a shift towards higher penalties for violations, reflecting a stricter approach to enforcing environmental regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendments significantly enhance the central government's influence over SPCBs by giving it the authority to prescribe the manner of nomination, terms, and conditions of service for SPCB chairpersons.  Previously, state governments held this authority.  The Act also grants the central government power to issue exemptions for certain industrial plants from consent requirements, although it requires consultation with the CPCB.  This centralization of authority aims to ensure more uniformity and effectiveness in water pollution control across the country.


**14. With reference to the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amended rules mandate local bodies to conduct a five-year assessment of plastic waste generation, develop infrastructure for waste management, and prevent the use of prohibited single-use plastics.
2.  Producers, importers, and brand owners are now responsible for collecting plastic packaging waste under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system, but manufacturers of compostable plastics are exempted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The amended rules significantly increase the responsibilities of local bodies in plastic waste management.  They are now required to conduct thorough assessments of plastic waste generation, plan for future needs, and develop or commission the necessary infrastructure for collection, storage, processing, and disposal.  Furthermore, they are tasked with actively preventing the sale and use of prohibited single-use plastics within their jurisdictions.  This reflects a stronger emphasis on local-level action in addressing the plastic waste problem.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement wrongly claims that manufacturers of compostable plastics are exempted from EPR responsibilities.  In fact, the amended rules *expand* the scope of EPR to include producers, importers, brand owners, and *also* manufacturers of compostable or biodegradable plastics.  This broader inclusion reflects the understanding that all stakeholders in the plastic value chain bear responsibility for managing the environmental impact of their products, regardless of whether the plastic is conventional or designed to be more environmentally friendly.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies totipotency as the underlying principle of PTC, which allows for the propagation of plants from small explants.  However, it incorrectly states that PTC is *not* applicable to threatened or rare species.  In fact, PTC is a vital tool for conserving endangered plants, as it allows for their propagation without the need to collect and potentially damage wild specimens.  This makes PTC a crucial technique in plant conservation efforts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The statement accurately describes the various applications of PTC.  Different techniques, such as organ culture, seed culture, and embryo culture, are employed depending on the specific needs and goals.  These techniques have wide-ranging uses, from propagating commercially valuable crops to conducting fundamental research on plant biology and developing new methods for producing artificial seeds for efficient propagation and distribution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly describes the Artemis Accords as a legally binding international treaty.  The Accords are actually a set of *non-binding* principles, meaning they don't have the force of law in the same way a treaty does.  They are intended to guide and encourage cooperation, but participation is voluntary, and there are no formal legal penalties for non-compliance.  India is also not a founding member; it joined later.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Artemis Accords do indeed focus on several key principles for responsible space exploration.  These include promoting peaceful uses of outer space, collaborating on the development of common infrastructure, ensuring transparency through data sharing, preserving historical sites and artifacts, and establishing guidelines for the sustainable use of space resources to avoid conflicts and ensure the long-term health of the space environment.  These principles represent a crucial step towards fostering international cooperation in space exploration.

2.  RTGs consist of a Radioisotope Heater Unit (RHU) that generates heat through radioactive decay, and a heat-to-electricity conversion system, typically using thermocouples.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly describes the electricity generation process in RTGs as nuclear fission.  RTGs actually generate electricity through *radioactive decay*, not fission.  Radioactive decay is a process where unstable atomic nuclei spontaneously release energy, while fission involves splitting a heavy nucleus into lighter ones.  The statement correctly points out their reliability and independence from solar proximity, but the incorrect description of the energy generation process makes it inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  This statement accurately describes the key components of an RTG.  The RHU utilizes the heat generated by the radioactive decay of materials like Plutonium-238.  This heat is then converted into electricity by a heat-to-electricity conversion system, most commonly using thermocouples, which generate a voltage due to the temperature difference between their junctions.  This design enables a reliable and long-lasting power source for spacecraft in remote locations far from the sun.


**20. With reference to Ion Thruster Engines, consider the following statements:**

1. Ion thrusters use chemical combustion to generate thrust, making them suitable for high-speed maneuvers but less efficient for long-duration space missions.
2. Ion thrusters, using electricity to accelerate ionized gas, provide low thrust but high specific impulse, making them ideal for long-duration missions and station-keeping.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly describes ion thrusters as using chemical combustion.  Ion thrusters are a form of *electric* propulsion, not chemical propulsion.  They utilize electricity to ionize a propellant gas and then accelerate the ions to generate thrust.  Chemical propulsion relies on the combustion of fuels and oxidizers for thrust generation.  This fundamental difference in propulsion mechanisms impacts their efficiency and suitability for different mission profiles.

Statement 2 is correct. Ion thrusters produce low thrust compared to chemical rockets but have a significantly higher specific impulse.  Specific impulse is a measure of a rocket engine's efficiency, indicating how much thrust it can generate per unit of propellant consumed.  The high specific impulse of ion thrusters makes them very efficient for long-duration missions where continuous, low-level thrust is required, such as station-keeping or deep-space travel.  Their low thrust is offset by their ability to operate for extended periods with minimal propellant consumption.


**1. With reference to Genome Editing techniques, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bt cotton is the only GM crop currently approved for commercial cultivation in India,  it's crucial to note that its effectiveness against bollworm pests, specifically the Pink Bollworm (PBW), has been declining.  The statement incorrectly asserts complete and continued effectiveness against all bollworm pests.  The need for new transgenic cotton seeds with the Cry2Ai gene highlights this limitation.

Statement 2 is correct. GM mustard (DMH-11) does indeed incorporate two alien genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens* and resulted from a cross between the Varuna and Early Heera-2 varieties. This accurately reflects the development process and genetic composition of DMH-11.


**3. With reference to Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), consider the following statements:**

1. Adzynma, approved by the USFDA, is the first recombinant protein product for on-demand ERT, used to treat congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP), a common blood clotting disorder.
2. ERT involves administering replacement enzymes to patients with enzyme deficiencies or malfunctions, regardless of the underlying cause.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Adzynma is indeed the first recombinant protein product for on-demand ERT approved by the USFDA for treating cTTP, the statement inaccurately describes cTTP as a *common* blood clotting disorder.  cTTP is actually a *rare* disorder.

Statement 2 is correct. ERT's core principle is to provide replacement enzymes to patients suffering from conditions stemming from enzyme deficiencies or malfunctions, irrespective of the specific cause of the deficiency.  This broad applicability is a defining feature of ERT.


**4. With reference to Gene-drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. GDT modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns, primarily focusing on increasing the likelihood of undesirable traits being passed to subsequent generations.
2. GDT utilizes three key components: a gene, the Cas9 enzyme, and CRISPR technology, with the genetic material encoding for these elements inserted into an animal's DNA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GDT aims to *increase* the likelihood of a *particular suite* of genes being passed to the next generation.  It's not designed to promote undesirable traits but rather to spread beneficial or targeted genetic modifications within a population.  The focus is on altering inheritance to achieve specific outcomes, not to randomly increase the prevalence of any trait.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description accurately outlines the three core components of GDT: a gene, the Cas9 enzyme (acting as molecular scissors), and CRISPR technology (repetitive DNA sequences).  The insertion of genetic material encoding these elements into an animal's DNA is also a fundamental aspect of the technology.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Genome Sequencing techniques:**

1. Short-read sequencing is more effective for applications requiring the identification of specific DNA sequences and assembling complex genomes like the Y chromosome.
2. Long-read sequencing is preferred for applications focusing on counting the abundance of specific sequences and profiling gene expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Short-read sequencing, due to its fragmentation approach, is *less* effective at assembling complex genomes like the Y chromosome with its repetitive sequences. Long-read sequencing is better suited for this task.  Short-read sequencing excels at quantifying specific sequences, not complex genome assembly.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Long-read sequencing, while useful in assembling complex genomes, is *not* the primary method used for counting the abundance of specific sequences or profiling gene expression. Short-read sequencing is much better suited for these high-throughput applications.


**6. With reference to the Y-chromosome, consider the following statements:**

1. The Y chromosome is the largest human chromosome, containing over 50% of the human genome and a large number of protein-coding genes.
2.  The Y chromosome is male-determining due to the presence of the SRY gene and is passed down from mother to son.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Y chromosome is actually the *smallest* human chromosome, representing only about 2% of the human genome and containing relatively few protein-coding genes (around 100).  The statement significantly overestimates its size and gene content.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Y chromosome is indeed male-determining because of the SRY gene, but it's passed down from *father* to *son*, not from mother to son.  This is a fundamental aspect of sex-linked inheritance.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT):**

1. MDT involves replacing diseased mitochondria in a mother's egg with healthy mitochondria from the father's sperm to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases.
2. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are two common MDT techniques that involve combining the parents’ nuclear DNA with healthy donated mitochondria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MDT replaces diseased mitochondria with healthy ones from a *donor*, not the father's sperm. The father's genetic material (nuclear DNA) is still used, but the healthy mitochondria come from a female donor to avoid passing on mitochondrial diseases.

Statement 2 is correct. Both MST and PNT are established MDT techniques that combine the parents' nuclear DNA with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg to produce an embryo free from mitochondrial diseases.  The methods differ in their approach to combining the genetic material, but both achieve the same outcome.


**8. With reference to Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), consider the following statements:**

1. cfDNA refers to small fragments of nucleic acids found only within cells in body fluids like plasma, and its quantity remains relatively constant regardless of health status.
2.  Applications of cfDNA analysis include detecting genetic abnormalities in fetuses and monitoring immune responses after organ transplantation.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While these synthetic embryo-like structures closely resemble natural embryos in their earliest stages, they are *not* perfect replicas.  Crucially, they lack fully developed organs such as a beating heart or a brain.  The structures are simplified models useful for studying early development.

Statement 2 is correct.  A major advantage of these synthetic models is their potential to shed light on the impact of genetic disorders on embryonic development and to investigate the underlying causes of recurrent miscarriages.  This offers a valuable research tool with ethical advantages over using natural embryos.



**1. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  CRISPR/Cas9 technology is used to alter the DNA of organisms, potentially changing physical traits and mitigating disease risk but it always involves alien genetic material.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading.  While methanol *is* a colorless and volatile liquid with a slightly sweet odor, and it *is* used as a solvent in industrial processes, the statement overemphasizes its role in fuel cell technology.  While research explores methanol as a potential fuel source, its current widespread industrial applications lie primarily in chemical synthesis (e.g., formaldehyde production) and as a solvent in various industries.   The statement's inclusion of "fuel cell industry" as a major application is a distractor – it's a developing area, not a current primary use.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Methanol is indeed highly toxic if ingested, causing severe metabolic acidosis.  The mechanism of toxicity involves its metabolism to formaldehyde and formic acid, which are highly damaging to the body.  The treatment strategy correctly identifies the use of ethanol as a competitive inhibitor, slowing down methanol's metabolism and reducing the formation of toxic metabolites.  This competitive inhibition allows the body to gradually clear the methanol without causing further damage.  Therefore, the core of the statement is factually accurate, despite the slight emphasis on flammability being a secondary concern compared to its toxicity.


**3. With reference to Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The glycemic index (GI) is a ranking system for carbohydrate-containing foods based on how quickly they raise blood glucose levels after consumption. High-GI foods lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar, triggering a strong insulin response.  Over time, this repeated cycle of high glucose and insulin can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively, leading to insulin resistance, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes.  The statement accurately captures this key metabolic consequence of consuming high-GI foods.

Statement 2 is also correct. While GI provides a useful measure of how quickly a food raises blood sugar, it doesn't account for the quantity of carbohydrates consumed.  Glycemic Load (GL) addresses this limitation by incorporating both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates in a serving.  For instance, a food with a high GI but a small serving size might have a low GL, indicating a minimal impact on blood glucose.  GL, therefore, provides a more nuanced and realistic assessment of a food's impact on blood sugar and overall metabolic health, making it a superior metric for dietary planning compared to GI alone.  The statement correctly highlights the complementary nature and improved accuracy of GL over GI.

The tube is a crucial element, requiring robust materials and construction to withstand the high speeds and low-pressure environment.


**13. With reference to India’s Three-Stage Nuclear Power Program, consider the following statements:**

1. Stage 1 utilizes Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) using enriched uranium as fuel and producing Plutonium-239 as a byproduct.
2. Stage 3 reactors are envisioned to use U-233 produced from thorium in advanced self-sustaining thorium-based reactors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Stage 1 of India's nuclear power program uses *natural* uranium, not enriched uranium, as fuel in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs).  The use of natural uranium is a strategic choice, leveraging India's readily available uranium resources.  Plutonium-239 is indeed a byproduct of this process.

Statement 2 is correct. Stage 3 of the program focuses on utilizing thorium as a fuel source.  The plan involves using Uranium-233, bred from thorium, in advanced reactors.  This is a long-term strategy to leverage India's abundant thorium reserves and create a sustainable nuclear fuel cycle.


**14. With reference to Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs), consider the following statements:**

1. FBRs use slow neutrons to induce fission in fissile material and convert fertile material into new fissile material using a moderator.
2. A key advantage of FBRs is their efficient use of nuclear fuel, extending the lifespan of uranium reserves, and reduction in the volume and long-term radioactivity of nuclear waste.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FBRs utilize *fast* neutrons, not slow neutrons, to induce fission.  The absence of a moderator allows the neutrons to maintain their high energy, increasing the efficiency of the fission process.  The conversion of fertile material into fissile material is a key characteristic of breeder reactors.

Statement 2 is correct.  FBRs offer significant advantages in terms of nuclear fuel utilization. Their ability to breed new fissile material from fertile material means they can use uranium resources much more efficiently, extending the lifespan of available reserves.  They also produce significantly less high-level radioactive waste compared to conventional reactors, reducing the long-term environmental impact.


**15. With reference to Thorium Reactors, consider the following statements:**

1. Thorium reactors primarily use Uranium-235 as fuel and are designed to operate at extremely high pressures.
2.  Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), a type of thorium reactor, offer advantages such as reduced nuclear waste, enhanced safety, and lower operating pressures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Thorium reactors utilize thorium-232 as their primary fuel source, not Uranium-235.  Thorium-232 itself is not fissile, but it can be converted into fissile Uranium-233 through neutron absorption.  Moreover, some thorium reactor designs, like Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), operate at atmospheric pressure, not high pressure.

Statement 2 is correct. Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), which can be designed to use thorium, offer several inherent advantages.  They produce less radioactive waste compared to conventional reactors due to their ability to continuously reprocess the fuel.  Their design also incorporates passive safety features that enhance their safety and reduce the risk of accidents.  Many MSR designs operate at or near atmospheric pressure, further enhancing safety.



**1. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, exclusively utilize foreign genetic material to modify an organism's DNA.
2.  SDN1 and SDN2 genome editing methods are distinguished from SDN3 by their exclusion of alien genetic material, resulting in products indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful genome editing tool, it doesn't *exclusively* use foreign genetic material.  Genome editing can involve modifications within the existing genetic material of an organism.  The process can introduce changes like small deletions, substitutions, or additions of nucleotides without introducing entirely new genes from other species.  Other genome editing techniques, like ZFNs and TALENs, also operate similarly.  Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), on the other hand, typically involve the introduction of foreign genes (transgenes).

Statement 2 is correct.  The classification of SDN (Site-Directed Nuclease) methods into SDN1, SDN2, and SDN3 is based on the source of the genetic material used in the editing process. SDN1 and SDN2 methods do not incorporate foreign genetic material and the final product is genetically identical to those produced by conventional breeding.  SDN3, however, involves the introduction of genes from other species, thus making a distinct difference from conventional breeding.  This distinction highlights the crucial difference in the regulatory landscape and public perception concerning genome-edited crops versus GMOs.


**2. With reference to Gene Drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. Gene Drive Technology solely relies on CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and other gene editing techniques are not applicable.
2.  Gene Drive systems aim to modify Mendelian inheritance patterns, increasing the probability of specific gene traits being inherited by subsequent generations, potentially surpassing normal inheritance patterns.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a commonly used tool in GDT due to its precision and efficiency, it is not the only method that can be employed.  Other gene editing tools and techniques could potentially be adapted for gene drive applications. The core principle of GDT is to bias inheritance beyond typical Mendelian ratios, irrespective of the specific technology used to achieve that bias.

Statement 2 is correct.  The fundamental goal of GDT is to manipulate the natural inheritance patterns of genes.  In typical Mendelian inheritance, traits are passed down with a certain probability determined by the laws of inheritance. GDT seeks to override this natural probability, increasing the likelihood of a specific gene (or set of genes) being inherited by a higher proportion of offspring than would naturally occur. This "drive" allows for the rapid spread of a specific trait within a population, which has potential implications for controlling disease vectors or managing invasive species.


**3. With reference to  CAR T-cell Therapy, consider the following statements:**

1. CAR T-cell therapy involves modifying B cells to produce chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that target cancer cells.
2. NexCAR19, India's first homegrown CAR T-cell therapy, targets the CD19 protein found on the surface of certain cancer cells and demonstrated effectiveness in a clinical trial involving over 100 participants.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CAR T-cell therapy uses T cells, not B cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the adaptive immune system.  The process involves extracting T cells from a patient, genetically modifying them to express CARs (chimeric antigen receptors), and then reintroducing them to target and destroy cancer cells expressing a specific antigen. B cells, another type of white blood cell, are primarily involved in antibody production.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While NexCAR19 does target the CD19 protein and is India's first homegrown CAR T-cell therapy, the clinical trial it was based on involved 64 participants, not over 100. This illustrates the importance of precise recall of details in evaluating scientific claims and the need for careful scrutiny of the supporting data. The smaller sample size doesn't diminish the significance of the achievement but highlights the need for further research and larger-scale trials to fully establish its efficacy and safety.


**4.  With reference to  Sickle Cell Anemia, consider the following statements:**

1. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a gene mutation affecting the hemoglobin gene, leading to rigid, crescent-shaped red blood cells that can obstruct blood flow.  The inheritance is autosomal dominant.
2.  Current cures for Sickle Cell Anemia include bone marrow transplants and experimental gene therapies, with CRISPR technology showing promising results in gene editing approaches.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The description of sickle cell anemia and its cause is accurate.  However, the inheritance pattern is described incorrectly. Sickle cell anemia is inherited in an autosomal *recessive* pattern, meaning an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease.  Autosomal dominant inheritance would mean that only one copy of the mutated gene would be sufficient to cause the disease.

Statement 2 is correct. Bone marrow transplantation is currently the most established cure, though it carries significant risks.  Several experimental gene therapy approaches are under investigation, aiming to either correct the mutated gene directly or reactivate fetal hemoglobin production to mitigate the disease's effects. CRISPR technology is one promising tool in these gene editing approaches, showing potential for a more effective and less risky treatment.


**5. With reference to Xenotransplantation, consider the following statements:**

1.  Xenotransplantation involves transplanting live cells, tissues, or organs from a human donor to a non-human animal recipient.
2. Pigs are frequently used in xenotransplantation research due to their physiological similarities to humans and the availability of organs suitable for transplantation, despite the challenges posed by immune rejection.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Xenotransplantation is defined as the process of transplanting live cells, tissues, or organs from a *non-human* animal source to a human recipient. The statement reverses the donor and recipient, representing a significant misunderstanding of the procedure.  The ethical and practical challenges associated with xenotransplantation are considerable, and the focus is on mitigating the risks of immune rejection and transmission of animal diseases.

Statement 2 is correct.  Pigs are frequently chosen for xenotransplantation research primarily due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, making their organs relatively suitable for transplantation.  However, the major hurdle is overcoming the strong immune rejection response in humans to pig organs.  Researchers are actively exploring gene editing and other techniques to address this challenge, making pigs a crucial model in this field.


**6. With reference to  mRNA Vaccines, consider the following statements:**

1. mRNA vaccines introduce a weakened or inactive form of a virus or bacteria into the body to stimulate an immune response.
2.  mRNA vaccines utilize messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules to instruct cells to produce a viral protein, triggering an immune response without directly introducing the virus.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. This describes the mechanism of action of traditional vaccines, which use weakened or inactivated pathogens.  mRNA vaccines operate through a fundamentally different mechanism. They do not introduce the pathogen itself but instead introduce genetic material (mRNA) that instructs the body's cells to produce a specific viral protein. This protein then triggers an immune response, preparing the body to fight the actual virus if encountered later.

Statement 2 is correct. mRNA vaccines introduce a synthetic mRNA molecule encoding for a specific viral antigen.  Once inside the body's cells, the mRNA is translated into the corresponding viral protein, which is then presented to the immune system.  This process elicits an immune response without the need to introduce the actual virus, making them generally safer and faster to develop than traditional vaccines.  The mRNA is quickly degraded by the body, minimizing any long-term effects.


**7. With reference to  Genome Sequencing, consider the following statements:**

1. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, successfully mapped 100% of the human genome.
2.  The Y chromosome, due to its unique structure and repetitive DNA sequences, was one of the last human chromosomes to be fully sequenced.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Human Genome Project, while a monumental achievement, did not map 100% of the human genome at the time of its completion in 2003. It covered approximately 92% of the genome.  The remaining "gaps" were largely due to the difficulty in sequencing highly repetitive regions of the genome.  The full and complete sequencing of the human genome (100%) was achieved later by the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium.

Statement 2 is correct. The Y chromosome presented unique challenges for sequencing due to its structure, including long stretches of repetitive DNA sequences and palindromic regions. These complexities made it difficult to assemble the sequences accurately using earlier sequencing technologies.  Therefore, it was among the last chromosomes to be fully sequenced, highlighting the advancements in sequencing technologies required to overcome these challenges.


**8. With reference to  Biofuels, consider the following statements:**

1. Biodiesel is produced through the process of fermentation, where vegetable oils or animal fats are converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).
2.  First-generation biofuels are typically derived from food crops, potentially leading to competition with food production and raising ethical and economic concerns.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Biodiesel is produced through *transesterification*, not fermentation. Fermentation is a biological process used in the production of ethanol (a biofuel), where microorganisms break down sugars to produce alcohol.  Transesterification, on the other hand, is a chemical process where vegetable oils or animal fats react with an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters), the main component of biodiesel.

Statement 2 is correct. First-generation biofuels are largely produced from food crops like corn, sugarcane, and soybeans.  This can lead to competition with food production, potentially driving up food prices and creating food security concerns. This competition highlights the need for exploring alternative feedstocks for biofuel production to ensure sustainable and ethical practices.  The use of food crops for fuel also raises ethical questions about resource allocation, particularly in regions where food insecurity is already a pressing issue.


**9. With reference to the National Hydrogen Mission, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Hydrogen Mission primarily focuses on producing grey hydrogen, which is derived from natural gas, to meet India's growing energy demands.
2.  The mission aims to establish India as a global leader in green hydrogen production, utilizing renewable energy sources for electrolysis and targeting substantial reductions in fossil fuel imports.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Hydrogen Mission's core focus is on *green* hydrogen production, not grey hydrogen.  Grey hydrogen is produced from natural gas through steam methane reforming, a process that generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.  The mission explicitly aims to reduce India's carbon footprint and reliance on fossil fuels.  The emphasis is on using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power to generate electricity for the electrolysis process, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen without releasing greenhouse gases.

Statement 2 is correct. The mission's primary objective is to establish India as a global leader in green hydrogen production and utilization.  It sets ambitious targets for green hydrogen production, renewable energy capacity expansion, and investment attraction, all aimed at achieving significant reductions in fossil fuel imports and greenhouse gas emissions.  These goals highlight India's commitment to a cleaner energy future and its ambition to play a leading role in the global transition to sustainable energy.


**10. With reference to  the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. NEMMP 2020 was launched in 2020 by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to promote the adoption of electric vehicles in India.
2. The plan aims to create a robust domestic electric vehicle (EV) industry, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and achieve significant fuel savings, alongside promoting sustainable transportation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NEMMP 2020 was actually launched in 2013, not 2020, by the Department of Heavy Industry.  While the plan has undergone revisions and updates since its inception, its initial launch date is crucial to understanding its historical context and evolution. The ministry mentioned is also incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The core objectives of NEMMP 2020 remain focused on promoting sustainable transportation, reducing dependence on fossil fuels, creating a robust domestic EV manufacturing industry, and achieving substantial fuel savings. These multifaceted goals underscore the plan's broader significance in addressing India's energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic growth objectives. The plan utilizes policy mechanisms such as the FAME India scheme to incentivize EV adoption and manufacturing.


**1. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, exclusively utilize foreign genetic material to introduce modifications into an organism's DNA.
2.  SDN1 and SDN2 genome editing methods are distinguishable from conventionally bred crop varieties due to the introduction of alien genes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful genome editing tool, it doesn't *exclusively* use foreign genetic material.  Genome editing can involve modifications within the existing genome without introducing foreign DNA.  Techniques like SDN1 and SDN2 achieve this.  The introduction of foreign genetic material is a characteristic of genetic modification (GM), which is distinct from genome editing.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The defining characteristic of SDN1 and SDN2 is that they *do not* involve alien genetic material.  The end result is indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties because only the existing genetic material is modified.  SDN3, on the other hand, does introduce foreign genes.  Therefore, the statement misrepresents the key difference between these techniques.  The distinction lies in the source of the genetic material used for modification, not in the final product's distinguishability.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Plant Tissue Culture (PTC):**

1. PTC solely relies on the use of differentiated plant cells as explants for culturing purposes, excluding undifferentiated tissues or organs.
2.  A primary benefit of PTC is the ability to propagate and genetically improve commercially valuable plants in a significantly longer timeframe compared to traditional methods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PTC utilizes *both* undifferentiated and differentiated plant cells, tissues, and organs as explants.  The versatility of PTC is a key advantage, allowing for the use of various plant materials depending on the specific application and goal. The definition of PTC explicitly mentions the use of undifferentiated plant cells, tissues, or organs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  PTC is actually known for its ability to propagate and genetically improve plants in a *much shorter* timeframe than traditional methods.  This rapid propagation is a major advantage for commercial applications, allowing for faster production of desirable plant varieties.  The statement contradicts this crucial advantage of PTC.


**3. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consider the following statements:**

1. The JWST operates primarily in the visible light spectrum, providing high-resolution images of celestial objects similar to Hubble Telescope.
2.  The JWST's infrared capabilities allow it to observe objects too faint or distant to be detected by telescopes operating in visible or ultraviolet wavelengths.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JWST's primary operational wavelength is in the infrared spectrum, not the visible light spectrum.  While it can detect some near-infrared light, its main advantage lies in its ability to capture infrared radiation, which is crucial for observing distant and faint objects whose light has been redshifted. Hubble, in contrast, primarily operates in the visible and ultraviolet spectrums.

Statement 2 is correct. The JWST's infrared capabilities are crucial for observing objects whose visible light has been redshifted due to the expansion of the universe or obscured by interstellar dust.  This allows it to peer further back in time and observe the formation of early galaxies and stars.  The statement accurately reflects one of the JWST's key scientific goals and technological advantages.


**4. With reference to Gene Therapy, consider the following statements:**

1. Germline gene therapy, which involves modifying germline cells, is widely practiced and considered safe for widespread application in treating both inherited and acquired disorders.
2. Somatic cell gene therapy is limited in its application, only effective in treating inherited disorders, while acquired disorders require different therapeutic approaches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Germline gene therapy, while theoretically powerful, is ethically controversial and largely *not* practiced due to concerns about unintended consequences and heritability of modifications. The modifications would be passed to future generations, and the long-term effects are unpredictable.  Somatic cell therapy is the more widely accepted and researched type of gene therapy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Somatic cell gene therapy can be applied to both inherited and acquired disorders.  The therapy focuses on modifying somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) of an individual, and therefore it does not affect future generations.  The statement misrepresents the scope and applicability of somatic cell gene therapy.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning  Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT):**

1. MRT aims to replace faulty mitochondria in a mother's egg or embryo with healthy mitochondria from a donor, thereby preventing the transmission of mitochondrial diseases to the offspring.
2. The Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) technique involves fertilizing both the mother's egg and a donor egg before transferring the pronuclei, ensuring the offspring inherits only nuclear DNA from the mother and mitochondria from the donor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MRT is a specific IVF technique designed precisely to prevent the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases by replacing the mother's potentially faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor. This ensures that the child receives nuclear DNA from both parents but healthy mitochondria from the donor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The description of the MST technique is inaccurate. In MST, the *nucleus* (containing the majority of the genetic material) from the mother's egg is transferred to a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed but retains healthy mitochondria.  The pronuclear transfer (PNT) technique, on the other hand, involves fertilizing both eggs before the transfer of pronuclei.  The statement confuses the two main techniques of MRT.


**6. With reference to GM crops, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bt cotton, a genetically modified crop, contains genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that produce proteins toxic to only a limited range of pests, making it susceptible to other pests such as pink bollworm.
2.  GM mustard (DMH-11) contains only one alien gene isolated from the soil bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, which makes it herbicide-tolerant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bt cotton does contain genes from *Bacillus thuringiensis* producing proteins toxic to certain pests, the statement is misleading in implying limited pest resistance.  Although initially effective, Bt cotton has shown reduced efficacy against evolving pests like the pink bollworm.  The statement oversimplifies the complex interaction between Bt cotton and pest resistance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. GM mustard (DMH-11) contains *three*, not one, alien genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*. These genes contribute to male sterility (barnase), its reversal (barstar), and herbicide tolerance (bar). The statement significantly understates the number of foreign genes involved in DMH-11's genetic modification.


**7.  With reference to  Space Weather, consider the following statements:**

1.  Space weather primarily refers to the conditions on the surface of the Sun, excluding the effects of solar emissions and particles on Earth and other celestial objects.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. LMMs are, in fact, *more* advanced than LLMs.  LLMs primarily process text data, while LMMs are capable of processing and understanding multiple data modalities (text, images, audio, video, etc.), making them more versatile and powerful. The statement reverses the relationship between LMMs and LLMs in terms of advancement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India AI Mission aims to build a broad AI ecosystem that includes both public and private sector participation. The deployment of 10,000 GPUs is meant to support this comprehensive approach, encompassing government initiatives and private sector collaborations. The statement falsely restricts the mission's scope to only the private sector.


**10. With reference to  the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), consider the following statements:**

1. The 4IR primarily focuses on advancements in traditional manufacturing processes, excluding the incorporation of digital technologies such as AI and additive manufacturing.
2. The Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) initiative, launched by the World Economic Forum (WEF), solely focuses on technological advancements within individual nations and excludes any collaborative international efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WEF's C4IR initiative is explicitly designed to foster *international* collaboration and knowledge sharing on 4IR technologies and their societal impact.  It's not limited to national-level efforts but promotes a global approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by the 4IR.  The statement misrepresents the international nature of the C4IR initiative.


**1. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology was used to develop a low-pungent mustard variety in India, reducing glucosinolates to levels comparable to Canola.
2.  SDN1 and SDN2 genome editing methods always introduce alien genetic material, resulting in genetically modified organisms distinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Indian researchers successfully employed CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create a low-pungent mustard variety from the 'Varuna' variety. This significantly reduced glucosinolate levels, bringing them down to the Canola quality limit (30 ppm), thereby mitigating goiter and internal organ abnormalities in livestock.  The use of CRISPR/Cas9 is a key detail showcasing advancements in gene editing technology.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SDN1 and SDN2 methods, unlike SDN3, *do not* involve alien genetic material.  The resulting modifications are indistinguishable from those achieved through conventional breeding techniques.  This is a crucial distinction in the debate surrounding genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the regulation of genome editing technologies. The statement incorrectly attributes the introduction of foreign genetic material to SDN1 and SDN2.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Basel I was primarily focused on minimum capital requirements (CAR), not risk-based supervision or detailed disclosures.  Risk-based supervision and enhanced disclosures were introduced in later accords.  The statement misattributes the focus of Basel I.

Statement 2 is correct. Basel III did indeed introduce both a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer.  These buffers are designed to increase the capital held by banks during periods of economic stability and to further strengthen the banking system's ability to withstand economic downturns.  The introduction of these buffers is a central feature of Basel III.



**1. With reference to the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Foods with a high GI cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels compared to foods with a low GI.
2.  The Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the GI of a food and the amount of carbohydrates in a serving to estimate the impact on blood sugar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load.  Statement 1 correctly defines the core principle of the GI:  foods with a higher GI value cause a faster and more significant rise in blood glucose levels after consumption than foods with a lower GI. This is because of differences in the rate of carbohydrate digestion and absorption.  Statement 2 is also correct, as the Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive metric than the GI alone. While the GI ranks foods based on their rate of glucose absorption, the GL takes into account both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates present in a typical serving. This provides a more accurate reflection of the overall impact of a food on blood sugar levels, making it a more useful tool for dietary management, especially for individuals with diabetes. Therefore, both statements are true and accurately describe the concepts of GI and GL.

1.  Methanol is a colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent odor, completely miscible with water and is primarily used as a solvent in the production of plastics.
2.  Treatment for methanol poisoning involves administering ethanol or an antidote called fomepizole to compete with methanol for metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While methanol is indeed a colorless liquid miscible with water, it is *not* flammable in the same way as other alcohols like ethanol. It has a faintly sweet, pungent odor.  Its primary use is not as a solvent in plastics production; rather, it finds applications in various chemical processes, including the synthesis of  dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Statement 2 is correct. The treatment of methanol poisoning focuses on inhibiting the metabolism of methanol by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.  This is achieved by administering ethanol, which competes with methanol for the enzyme's active site, slowing down the conversion of methanol to its toxic metabolites (formaldehyde and formic acid). Fomepizole is another antidote that acts as a more specific and potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Thus, only statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of methanol and its toxicology.


**3. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

1.  Avian influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins on their surface, with HPAI viruses causing mild disease in poultry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While avian influenza viruses are indeed classified into subtypes based on H and N proteins, the description of HPAI viruses is inaccurate.  HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) viruses cause *severe* disease and high mortality in infected poultry, not mild disease. LPAI (Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza) viruses cause mild or no symptoms. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  India's National Action Plan for Avian Influenza does *not* include vaccination against HPAI as a primary strategy. Vaccination against HPAI is not permitted in India. The plan focuses on other measures such as surveillance, culling, biosecurity, and quarantine. Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies, rendering option (d) as the correct answer.


**4.  With reference to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, consider the following statements:**

1.  MRI uses ionizing radiation, similar to X-rays, to create detailed images of internal body structures.
2.  The strong magnetic field used in MRI interacts with radio waves and hydrogen atoms in the body to generate cross-sectional images.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that does *not* use ionizing radiation like X-rays. This is a key advantage of MRI, as it avoids the potential risks associated with radiation exposure.  Statement 2 is correct. MRI leverages a powerful magnetic field to align the hydrogen atoms in the body.  Radio waves are then used to perturb these aligned atoms, and the signals emitted as the atoms return to their equilibrium state are detected and processed to create detailed cross-sectional images. The differences in the signals received from various tissues allow for differentiation in the images. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes the principles of MRI technology.


**5. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, always introduce foreign genetic material into the organism's genome.
2.  In contrast to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), genome editing modifies existing genetic material without introducing foreign genes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While some genome editing techniques might introduce foreign genetic material (like in SDN3), many others, including CRISPR-Cas9, can be used to make precise modifications to existing DNA without introducing foreign genes.  The process primarily involves cutting and repairing DNA at specific locations. Statement 2 is correct. This is a key distinction between genome editing and genetic modification. GMOs involve the introduction of foreign genes into an organism's genome, while genome editing focuses on modifying existing genes within the organism's native genetic material.  This difference has implications for regulatory frameworks and public perception.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the core differences between genome editing and GMO technologies.


**6. With reference to  the use of Liquid Nitrogen in food items, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. CAR-T cell therapy is a form of cellular immunotherapy where a patient's own T cells are extracted, genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets specific antigens on cancer cells, and then re-infused into the patient.  This targeted approach avoids the systemic side effects often associated with traditional chemotherapy which uses non-specific cytotoxic drugs. The modification involves the insertion of a gene that codes for the CAR, usually using viral vectors.

Statement 2 is also correct. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is a major concern in CAR-T cell therapy.  The engineered T cells, upon encountering their target cancer cells, can release an excessive amount of cytokines, leading to a potentially fatal "cytokine storm." This overreaction of the immune system can cause high fever, hypotension, organ damage, and other severe complications.  Management of CRS is a critical aspect of CAR-T cell therapy, and supportive care measures are crucial to mitigate its effects.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Glycemic Index (GI) does not measure the total amount of carbohydrates in a food. Instead, it measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood sugar levels relative to a standard food (usually glucose).  A food's GI is a ranking on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a faster and greater rise in blood glucose.  The carbohydrate content is a factor influencing GI, but it's not the sole determinant.  Other factors such as fiber content, cooking methods, and the presence of fats and proteins also play a role.

Statement 2 is correct.  High GI foods are characterized by their rapid digestion and absorption, leading to a swift increase in blood glucose levels. This rapid rise can be problematic for individuals with diabetes, as it can overwhelm the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively.  This can lead to hyperglycemia, requiring increased insulin doses or other management strategies to prevent acute complications.  Conversely, low GI foods cause a slower and more gradual rise in blood glucose, facilitating better blood sugar control.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is fundamentally different from X-rays in that it does not utilize ionizing radiation.  X-rays use high-energy electromagnetic radiation that can potentially damage cells and DNA. MRI, on the other hand, employs a strong magnetic field and radio waves to generate images. This makes MRI a safer imaging modality, especially for repeated scans or for patients who are sensitive to ionizing radiation.

Statement 2 is correct.  MRI is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that provides detailed images of the body's internal structures.  It works by using a powerful magnetic field to align the hydrogen atoms within the body's tissues.  Radio waves are then used to perturb these aligned atoms, and the signals emitted as the atoms return to their original state are detected and processed by a computer to construct detailed images. The technique is non-invasive, avoiding the need for surgical procedures or injections of contrast agents in most cases.


**1. With reference to Ethylene and its use in food ripening, consider the following statements:**

1. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) permits the use of ethylene gas for artificial ripening of fruits, provided the concentration does not exceed 100 ppm.

Statement 2 is correct.  The treatment for methanol poisoning, involving ethanol or fomepizole, is accurately stated. This highlights the importance of knowing the appropriate medical response to specific poisonings, a detail that might not be common knowledge.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Glycemic Index (GI):**

1.  The Glycemic Index ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100, based on their ability to raise blood glucose levels compared to pure fructose (GI of 100).
2.  High GI foods cause rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels, potentially straining the body's insulin production and utilization, particularly problematic for individuals with diabetes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The comparison in the definition of GI is made to pure glucose (which has a GI of 100), not fructose. This seemingly small detail can easily mislead those with a superficial understanding of the Glycemic Index.  The substitution of fructose for glucose serves as a clever distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The statement accurately describes the impact of high GI foods on blood sugar levels and the consequences for individuals with diabetes. This accurately reflects the health implications of GI and its relevance to managing diabetes.


**5. With reference to Avian Influenza (Bird Flu), consider the following statements:**

This sensitivity makes them suitable for detecting minute changes in magnetic fields, which can be translated into valuable diagnostic information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The relationship between the sensitivity of GMR and electrical resistance is not an inverse proportionality.  Instead, the electrical resistance of the conductor sandwiched between two magnetic materials *changes* depending on the relative alignment of the magnetic fields in those adjacent materials. When the magnetic fields are aligned parallel, the resistance is low; when they are antiparallel, the resistance is high. This change in resistance, proportional to the magnetic field, is the basis of GMR's functionality.  The sensitivity is directly related to the magnitude of this resistance change. A larger change in resistance indicates higher sensitivity to the magnetic field.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Nuclear Fusion:**

2. Advantages of SMRs include adaptability and scalability, longer refueling intervals (3-7 years), compact design, passive safety features, and economic benefits from co-generation applications.  International conventions like the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage govern their operation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the power generation capacity range is correctly stated, the description of SMRs as "large" is wrong; they are specifically designed to be *small* compared to conventional reactors. The assertion that all SMRs use pressurized water cooling is also inaccurate; some utilize other coolants, such as helium (as mentioned in the source text).

Statement 2 is correct. The listed advantages of SMRs—adaptability, longer refueling intervals, compact design, passive safety features, and economic benefits—are all accurate. The existence of international conventions governing nuclear liability is also a true statement.


**4. With reference to Lithium-ion Batteries, consider the following statements:**

1. Lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable batteries where lithium ions move from the positive electrode (cathode) to the negative electrode (anode) during discharge and vice versa during charging.  They utilize water as an electrolyte and have a limited cycle life of 400-500 cycles.
2.  John Bannister Goodenough, a Nobel laureate, developed a lithium battery with a cathode of cobalt oxide; these batteries are lightweight, have high energy density, require low maintenance, and are characterized by a memory effect that limits their performance with repeated partial charge/discharge cycles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of ion movement during charge and discharge is correct, but the electrolyte is not water; it is an organic compound, typically an ether. The cycle life is also incorrect; Lithium-ion batteries have a significantly longer cycle life (5000 or more cycles) compared to lead-acid batteries (400-500 cycles).

Statement 2 is mostly incorrect. While John Goodenough's contribution to lithium-ion battery technology is accurate, the description of the battery's characteristics contains a factual error:  Lithium-ion batteries *do not* exhibit a memory effect. This is a characteristic of older Nickel-Cadmium batteries. The other characteristics (lightweight, high energy density, low maintenance) are correct.  The combination of correct and incorrect information makes the statement as a whole incorrect.


**5. With reference to Nuclear Fusion, consider the following statements:**

1. Nuclear fusion is a process where two heavy atomic nuclei combine to form a lighter one, releasing a massive amount of energy. This process occurs in a state of matter called plasma, a hot, charged gas composed of negative ions and free-moving electrons.  The Coulomb barrier prevents the nuclei from easily combining, requiring immense energy to overcome.
2.  Net Energy Gain (NEG), crucial for commercial fusion power, means that the fusion process consumes more energy than it generates.  The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project aims to demonstrate NEG, and India participates in this project.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The description of fusion as combining *heavy* nuclei is wrong; it involves combining *light* atomic nuclei.  The description of plasma is mostly correct, although it is composed of *positive* ions, not negative. The rest of the statement is accurate.  The inaccuracies make the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of NEG is fundamentally wrong.  NEG means the fusion process generates *more* energy than it consumes, not the other way around. The involvement of India in ITER is correctly stated, but the incorrect definition of NEG renders the statement false.


**6.  With reference to the International Space Station (ISS), consider the following statements:**

1. The ISS is a habitable artificial satellite orbiting Earth at an altitude of between 370-460 km in the stratosphere and involves collaboration primarily between the USA, Russia, Japan, and Canada.

2. ISRO has indigenously developed the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) for Gaganyaan. The mission successfully completed tests of the human-rated L110-G Vikas engine and the Service Module Propulsion System (SMPS).  The CE-20 Cryogenic Engine, utilizing a gas-generator cycle with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants, is a key component.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The mission duration is 3 days, not 7.  The description of the LVM3 stages is correct. The statement incorrectly attributes the use of a *semi*-cryogenic engine to the upper stage; while semi-cryogenic engines are under development by ISRO, the upper stage of the LVM3 for Gaganyaan uses a cryogenic engine.

Statement 2 is correct. The indigenous development of ECLSS, successful testing of the L110-G Vikas engine and SMPS, and the use of the CE-20 cryogenic engine are all accurate facts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Solar flares originate in the Sun's atmosphere, not its core.  They are *often*, but not *always*, accompanied by CMEs.  Their frequency varies significantly with the solar cycle, being much more frequent during solar maximum.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the emitted radiation, the atmospheric absorption and its effects on radio communication, and the classification system are all accurate.


**9. With reference to Antimatter, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. RTGs generate electricity through radioactive *decay*, not fission.  They are specifically designed to *not* be dependent on solar proximity.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of the components (RHU, thermocouple conversion) is accurate, as is the information about ISRO's development efforts and the successful use of RTGs in US space missions.



**1. With reference to Genome Editing (GE), consider the following statements:**

1.  Gene-drive technology (GDT), a type of GE, uses site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to make changes in an organism's DNA, potentially mitigating disease risk.  These changes can include small deletions, substitutions, or additions of nucleotides.
2.  Both SDN1 and SDN2 GE methods, unlike SDN3, do not involve alien genetic material, resulting in edited organisms indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gene-drive technology is indeed a type of genome editing that employs site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to modify an organism's DNA.  The manipulation of DNA through SDN techniques can lead to alterations in physical characteristics and potentially reduce the risk of diseases.  SDNs cleave DNA strands, facilitating subsequent genome editing, which can involve deletions, substitutions, or nucleotide additions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text clearly differentiates between SDN types.  SDN1 and SDN2 methods do not incorporate foreign genetic material, leading to edited organisms that are genetically identical to those produced through conventional breeding techniques.  This contrasts with SDN3, which does utilize genes of foreign origin.  Therefore, the distinction highlighted in statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided.


**2. With reference to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), consider the following statements:**

1.  JWST's recent image of the Sagittarius C region, a star-forming area in the Milky Way's center, revealed details of protostars – stars in their formative stages, actively accumulating mass.
2.  JWST primarily utilizes radio wave frequencies to capture images of celestial objects, offering high resolution and deep space penetration capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

While graphene's high surface area does contribute to its thermal conductivity, the primary reason for its excellent thermal conductivity is its unique sp² hybridized carbon structure and strong covalent bonding, allowing for efficient phonon transport.  The statement incorrectly links high thermal conductivity with unsuitability for applications requiring high electrical resistance; in fact, graphene is also an excellent electrical conductor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The biocompatibility of graphene depends on several factors, including its purity, size, and surface functionalization.  While synthetic methods can control these factors to some extent, leading to improved biocompatibility in certain cases, it's inaccurate to claim that synthetic graphene *always* exhibits superior biocompatibility compared to all naturally occurring forms. The quality of both natural and synthetic graphene can vary significantly.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding radiometric dating:**

1. Calcium-41, with its half-life exceeding 99,000 years, is a more frequently occurring radioisotope in the Earth's crust compared to Carbon-14, making it superior for dating very old geological samples.
2.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique that exclusively utilizes Carbon-14 to determine the age of organic materials, irrespective of their age.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, Calcium-41 is *less* frequent than Carbon-14 in the Earth's crust. Secondly, while its longer half-life makes it suitable for dating older samples than Carbon-14,  "superior" is a subjective claim. The choice of radioisotope depends on the specific material and its age range.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Carbon-14 is a commonly used isotope in radiometric dating, ATTA is not limited to Carbon-14.  The technique is used to measure extremely low concentrations of various isotopes, expanding its application beyond Carbon-14 dating to other elements and thus other dating methods.


**3. With reference to the Draft National Strategy for Robotics (NSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSR categorizes robots solely into industrial and service robots, excluding medical robots from its purview.
2.  The Future Skills PRIME Project, under which the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Lab was established, focuses exclusively on AI and IoT technologies, omitting other emerging fields.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSR explicitly classifies robots into three categories: industrial, service, and medical robots.  The statement omits the crucial medical robot category, misrepresenting the NSR's scope.

2. The use of endoscopes to trigger heat production in nanoparticles for cancer treatment, as described in the text, represents a novel monotherapy approach, eliminating the need for combination therapies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that nanohybrids are *less* than 8 nm in size. The statement also incorrectly claims that only heat generation is used; the text mentions the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as another mechanism of tumor cell destruction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The described treatment using endoscopes and light-triggered heat production is explicitly referred to as a *combination* therapy in the text, not a monotherapy.  The combination involves both the heat generated and the ROS effects.


**5. With reference to White Phosphorus, consider the following statements:**

1. White phosphorus, a non-toxic substance with a mild odor, finds applications primarily in military munitions as an incendiary agent and is explicitly banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
2. The impact of white phosphorus exposure is limited to superficial burns, excluding systemic toxicity and respiratory issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. White phosphorus is *highly* toxic, possessing a pungent, garlic-like odor, not a mild one.  Furthermore, while its use as an incendiary agent is widespread in military applications, it is *not* explicitly banned under the CWC because its primary action is incendiary rather than a chemical attack on life processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly lists severe deep burns, systemic toxicity, coughing, and headaches as potential impacts of white phosphorus exposure. The statement significantly understates the severity and range of the effects.


**6. With reference to Tantalum, consider the following statements:**

1. Tantalum, a common and easily accessible metal, is characterized by low corrosion resistance and a low melting point, making it unsuitable for high-temperature applications.
2.  The discovery of tantalum in the Sutlej river sand in Punjab indicates abundant reserves and potentially reduces reliance on imported tantalum for applications such as electronics and semiconductors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Tantalum is a *rare* metal, not common.  It's known for its *high* corrosion resistance and *extremely* high melting point, making it suitable for high-temperature applications.

Statement 2 is incorrect while it is true that tantalum was discovered in the Sutlej river, it's inaccurate to infer from a single discovery that this indicates abundant reserves.  Further exploration is needed to assess the extent of the reserves.  Moreover, while tantalum is used in electronics and semiconductors, the discovery in the Sutlej river doesn't automatically imply a significant reduction in reliance on imports.


**7. With reference to Hyperloop technology, consider the following statements:**

1. Hyperloop systems operate within a high-pressure environment to minimize air resistance and friction, utilizing magnetic levitation for propulsion.
2.  The primary benefits of Hyperloop technology include extremely high speeds, low power consumption, and immunity to bad weather conditions; however, the initial cost is comparatively low, making it immediately cost-effective.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hyperloop systems operate within a *low-pressure* (near-vacuum) environment, not a high-pressure one, to minimize air resistance.  While magnetic levitation is used for propulsion, the statement's description is not entirely accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the *initial* cost of Hyperloop technology may be high, despite long-term cost effectiveness.  The statement incorrectly portrays the initial cost as low, contradicting the given information.


**8. With reference to the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Glycemic Index (GI) ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100 based on their ability to lower blood sugar levels compared to pure glucose (GI of 100).
2.  High GI foods are beneficial for individuals with diabetes due to their ability to cause slow and steady rises in blood sugar levels, preventing insulin spikes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The GI ranks foods based on their ability to *raise*, not lower, blood sugar levels.  The rest of the statement is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. High GI foods are *detrimental*, not beneficial, to individuals with diabetes because they cause *rapid*, not slow, fluctuations in blood sugar levels, leading to insulin spikes and challenges in blood sugar control.


**9. With reference to Avian Influenza, consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on the proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), which exhibit synergistic activities on interaction with sialic acid (SA).
2.  India permits vaccination against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) as a primary method for controlling outbreaks in poultry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The H and N proteins on the surface of avian influenza viruses exhibit *antagonistic*, not synergistic, activities when interacting with sialic acid (SA).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that vaccination against HPAI is *not* permitted in India.  The statement misrepresents India's policy on HPAI control in poultry.


**10. With reference to Methanol, consider the following statements:**

1. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, is a colorless, non-volatile liquid with a pungent odor, completely immiscible with water.
2.  The treatment for methanol poisoning involves administering ethanol or fomepizole, which act by accelerating the metabolism of methanol in the liver.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Methanol is described as a *fairly volatile* liquid, not non-volatile, and it is *completely mixable* with water, not immiscible.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that ethanol and fomepizole are used in treatment. However, they act by *competing* with methanol for metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver, thus slowing down methanol's conversion to toxic metabolites, not accelerating its metabolism.  The statement misrepresents the mechanism of action of the antidotes.


**11. With reference to Plant Tissue Culture (PTC), consider the following statements:**

1. Plant tissue culture relies on the principle of totipotency, which is the ability of a plant cell to divide and differentiate into any type of specialized cell, except for reproductive cells.
2.  PTC is primarily used for propagating commercially valuable plants and has limited applications in studying plant growth, metabolism, and physiology under controlled conditions.

**12.  With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Genome editing techniques, using site-directed nucleases (SDNs), exclusively involve the insertion of foreign genetic material to modify an organism's DNA.
2.  The CRISPR/Cas9 technology used in developing low-pungent mustard is a type of SDN3, necessitating the use of alien genetic material.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Genome editing using SDNs can involve various modifications such as small deletions, substitutions, or additions of nucleotides. It doesn't *exclusively* involve inserting foreign genetic material.  SDN1 and SDN2, for example, don't involve alien genetic material.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text doesn't specify the exact SDN type used in the low-pungent mustard development.  Even if it were SDN3, it is not necessarily true that it involved alien genetic material as there are ways to edit genes without introducing foreign material.


**13. With reference to  Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT), consider the following statements:**

1. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) involves transferring the mother's nucleus, containing most of the genetic material, into a donor egg that has had its mitochondria removed but its nucleus retained.
2. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) is performed before the fertilized eggs begin dividing, involving the transfer of the mother's pronuclei into a donor's fertilized egg with healthy mitochondria and its original pronuclei removed.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Graphene's high surface area and biocompatibility are *precisely* why it's highly suitable for biomedical applications such as drug delivery.  Its large surface area allows for significant drug loading, while its biocompatibility minimizes adverse reactions within the body.  The text explicitly mentions its use in "Biomedical (diagnostic, drug delivery etc.)".

Statement 2 is incorrect. While synthetic graphene *can* be produced from coke and pith (as stated in the text),  it's inaccurate to say it's *exclusively* produced from petroleum-based sources. The production methods are diverse and are evolving towards more sustainable options. The text does not limit its production to petroleum sources.  The question plays on the common misconception that all synthetic materials are petroleum-derived.


**2. With reference to Radiometric Dating using Calcium-41, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading.  The technique does use nuclear genetic material from both parents and mitochondrial material from a donor to prevent mitochondrial diseases. However, it's inaccurately called the "two-parent baby" technique; it is commonly referred to as the "three-parent baby" technique due to the involvement of three individuals' genetic material. Statement 2 accurately describes the MST and PNT techniques as the primary methods used in mitochondrial donation. Options (a) and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statement 1. Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. FRBs are indeed intense and short-lived bursts of radio waves, typically lasting only milliseconds.  Their brevity and intensity make them a fascinating area of astrophysical study. The statement correctly captures their key characteristics.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The phenomenon of dispersion, where lower-frequency radio waves from FRBs slow down more than higher-frequency waves as they pass through intervening matter (plasma), is a crucial tool for astronomers. By measuring this dispersion, scientists can infer the density of this matter, including the otherwise invisible matter present between galaxies. This allows for a unique way to probe the large-scale structure of the universe.  Therefore, both statements are factual and accurate representations of FRB properties and their scientific significance.


**2. With reference to Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GRBs are indeed the most energetic and luminous events known in the universe.  Their immense power stems from cataclysmic events such as the collapse of massive stars to form black holes or the merger of neutron stars. These events release an incredible amount of energy in the form of gamma rays, briefly outshining entire galaxies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GRBs do ionize molecules in the ionosphere, a significant finding is that they also have the potential to temporarily damage or deplete the ozone layer.  This is a serious consideration for the potential impact of GRBs on Earth’s environment and biosphere, not a minimal threat as stated.  The statement misrepresents the current scientific understanding of GRB effects. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects established knowledge about GRBs.


**3. With reference to Quasi-Moons, consider the following statements:**

1. A quasi-moon, like asteroid 2023 FW13, maintains a stable orbit around the Earth, similar to a traditional moon.
2. Quasi-moons are primarily influenced by the gravitational pull of the Earth, resulting in relatively short orbital periods around the Sun.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Quasi-moons do not orbit the Earth in the same way as a traditional moon. While they share a similar orbital period around the Sun as the Earth, their orbits are not directly bound to the Earth’s gravity. Instead, they exhibit a complex orbital dance, loosely influenced by the Earth’s gravitational pull but primarily orbiting the Sun.  The term "quasi-moon" reflects this transient and less direct gravitational relationship.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The orbital period of a quasi-moon around the Sun is roughly the same as the Earth's, not significantly shorter.  The Earth's gravitational influence is a secondary factor affecting the quasi-moon's trajectory, not the primary determinant of its orbital period.  Therefore, both statements inaccurately describe the nature and dynamics of quasi-moons.


**4. With reference to Zero Shadow Day, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Zero Shadow Day is a phenomenon where the sun is directly overhead, resulting in the absence of shadows cast by vertical objects.  This occurs because the sun's rays strike the object perpendicularly.  The statement accurately captures the essence of this event.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Earth's axial tilt and the Sun's position are involved, Zero Shadow Day does *not* occur only at the equator.  It occurs at locations between the tropics (but not only at the equator)  throughout the year at different times, depending on the latitude and the time of year. The statement incorrectly limits the geographical occurrence of this phenomenon.  Thus, only statement 1 is accurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. EMIC waves are observed in the Earth's inner magnetosphere, but their generation primarily occurs in equatorial latitudes, not high-latitude regions. They then propagate along magnetic field lines to their footprint in the high-latitude ionosphere. The statement mislocates the primary generation zone of these waves.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant consequence of EMIC waves is their ability to accelerate and precipitate energetic electrons into the Earth's atmosphere.  These high-energy electrons can pose a threat to satellites and other space-based technology, potentially causing damage to electronics or disrupting operations. The statement correctly highlights a crucial effect of EMIC waves.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has exempted only SDN-1 and SDN-2 categories of genome-edited plants from certain provisions, not all categories.  SDN-3, involving foreign genes, would likely still require more stringent regulatory oversight. The statement oversimplifies the regulatory landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the IBSC is responsible for certifying the absence of foreign DNA in genome-edited crops. This is a crucial aspect of the regulatory process, highlighting the distinction between genome editing and the introduction of foreign genetic material.

1.  Genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9, exclusively utilize alien genetic material to modify an organism's DNA, resulting in traits distinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.
2.  SDN1 and SDN2 genome editing methods, unlike SDN3, do not incorporate foreign genetic material, producing outcomes indistinguishable from conventionally bred crops.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Genome editing does not *exclusively* use alien genetic material. While CRISPR/Cas9 and other techniques *can* introduce foreign genes (as in SDN3),  methods like SDN1 and SDN2 modify existing genetic material without introducing external DNA. The key difference lies in the source of the genetic material being modified, not whether external material is *always* used.  The resulting traits in SDN1 and SDN2 are intended to be indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.

Statement 2 is correct.  SDN1 and SDN2 are specifically designed to avoid the introduction of foreign genetic material, making their results indistinguishable from those achieved through traditional breeding methods.  SDN3, however, involves the introduction of genes from different species, a key distinction from the other two.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MDT's primary goal is to prevent the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases.  It achieves this by combining the parents' nuclear DNA (carrying most of the genetic information) with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor. The procedures, MST and PNT, both aim for this outcome, albeit with different techniques of combining the genetic material. The statement accurately reflects the core purpose and methodology of MDT.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While MDT does involve replacing diseased mitochondria with healthy ones, the replacement doesn't always happen *before* fertilization.  Both MST and PNT can be performed before or after IVF.  The statement's assertion that the replacement *always* occurs before fertilization is a misleading oversimplification of the process.  The timing of the procedure is a technical detail that varies depending on the specific technique used. The imprecise statement is a potential distractor for candidates.

Statement 2 is correct. It accurately describes neutrinos' properties (very little mass, no charge), their sources (stars, cosmic ray interactions), their weak interaction with matter, and the focus of the INO (atmospheric neutrinos).


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require deep understanding of the subject matter, going beyond simple recall.

**1. With reference to Biodiesel, consider the following statements:**

1. Biodiesel production through transesterification involves converting vegetable oils or animal fats into fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE).
2. Compared to petroleum diesel, biodiesel produces significantly less particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons, but NOx emissions may be slightly higher.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Biodiesel production through transesterification converts vegetable oils or animal fats into fatty acid *methyl* esters (FAME), not ethyl esters (FAEE). Methanol, not ethanol, is typically used in the process.  The use of ethanol would result in FAEE. This subtle difference makes statement 1 factually incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  Numerous studies have shown that biodiesel combustion yields significantly lower emissions of particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons compared to petroleum diesel. However, a slight increase in NOx emissions is a commonly observed trade-off. This is a well-established fact in the field of biofuel research.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Hydrogen as an alternative fuel:**

1.  Hydrogen production via electrolysis using renewable energy sources results in "grey" hydrogen, characterized by high CO2 emissions.
2.  Hydrogen's low density at standard conditions necessitates compression or cryogenic liquefaction for efficient storage and transportation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Hydrogen production via electrolysis using renewable energy sources (like solar or wind power) produces "green" hydrogen, which is considered a clean energy source because it doesn't involve CO2 emissions during the production process. "Grey" hydrogen, on the other hand, is produced from fossil fuels, leading to significant CO2 emissions. The statement incorrectly links renewable electrolysis with high CO2 emissions.

Statement 2 is correct. Hydrogen has a very low density compared to other fuels.  This makes it challenging to store and transport economically.  Compression to high pressures or cryogenic liquefaction (cooling to extremely low temperatures) are necessary to increase its energy density for practical applications. This is a fundamental challenge associated with hydrogen fuel infrastructure.


**3. With reference to Lithium-ion batteries, consider the following statements:**

1.  Graphite serves as the cathode material, where lithium ions are stored during the battery's charging cycle.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Graphite actually serves as the *anode* material in a lithium-ion battery, where lithium ions are stored during the battery's *discharge* cycle (when the battery is providing power). During charging, lithium ions migrate from the anode to the cathode.  The statement incorrectly identifies the electrode and the phase of the battery cycle.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The liquid electrolyte commonly used in lithium-ion batteries is often flammable and presents a significant safety risk.  Thermal runaway, resulting from internal short circuits or damage, can lead to fires or explosions.  This is a major area of research and development in improving lithium-ion battery safety.  The statement incorrectly portrays the electrolyte as safe.

2. The abundance of sodium and lower cost of materials contribute to the lower overall cost of sodium-ion batteries compared to lithium-ion batteries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Currently, sodium-ion batteries have a *lower* energy density than lithium-ion batteries. This limitation restricts their applications in energy-intensive devices like electric vehicles, where high energy density is crucial for extended range.  The statement presents the opposite of the current technological reality.

Statement 2 is correct. Sodium is far more abundant than lithium, and the materials used in sodium-ion batteries are generally less expensive. This contributes to their lower overall production cost compared to lithium-ion batteries, a key advantage in promoting their wider adoption.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning Biofuel production methods:**

1. Pyrolysis involves heating biomass in the presence of oxygen to break down organic materials.
2. Transesterification is a chemical process primarily used in biodiesel production, converting fats or oils into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and glycerol.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that involves heating biomass in the *absence* of oxygen. This process breaks down organic materials into bio-oil, syngas, and biochar. The presence of oxygen would lead to combustion, not pyrolysis. The statement incorrectly describes a crucial aspect of the pyrolysis process.

Statement 2 is correct. Transesterification is a well-established chemical process used extensively in biodiesel production. It involves reacting fats or oils with an alcohol (typically methanol) in the presence of a catalyst to produce FAMEs (biodiesel) and glycerol. This is a key chemical reaction in biofuel synthesis.


**6. With reference to the Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCE utilizes liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer and liquid hydrogen (LH2) as fuel.
2.  Compared to cryogenic engines, SCEs offer advantages such as easier storage and handling, higher thrust, and greater cost-effectiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SCE uses liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer, it uses refined kerosene (RP-1), not liquid hydrogen (LH2), as fuel. Liquid hydrogen is used in cryogenic engines.  The statement incorrectly identifies the fuel used in the SCE.

Statement 2 is correct.  The use of refined kerosene as fuel in SCEs provides several advantages over cryogenic engines, which utilize liquid hydrogen. Kerosene is easier to store and handle because it doesn't require cryogenic temperatures.  SCEs also generally offer higher thrust and are more cost-effective than cryogenic engines due to simpler design and less demanding storage requirements.


**7.  Consider the following statements about different types of batteries:**

1. Sand batteries store energy as heat using sand's thermal properties, primarily for electricity generation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sand batteries store energy as *heat*, not electricity. They leverage sand's high heat capacity to store thermal energy generated from excess renewable energy, which is later released on demand, typically for heating applications (not electricity generation directly).  The statement misrepresents the primary energy storage mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. Sodium-ion batteries are generally considered safer than lithium-ion batteries because sodium is inherently more stable than lithium.  However, a trade-off exists: sodium-ion batteries typically have a lower energy density compared to their lithium-ion counterparts, limiting their applications in devices requiring high energy storage capacity.


**8. With reference to the  PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) and CE-20 Cryogenic Engine, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. POEM-2 utilizes the spent *fourth* stage (PS4), not the first stage, of the PSLV launch vehicle as an orbital platform.  The statement misidentifies the stage used in the POEM-2 mission.

Statement 2 is correct. The CE-20 cryogenic engine is indeed designed to power the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle, which will be used for ISRO's Gaganyaan mission to send humans into space.  The statement accurately describes the engine's purpose and propellant.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding solar phenomena:**

1. Solar flares are intense, localized emissions of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere, always accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
2. Solar winds, a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona, travel at speeds exceeding one million miles per hour and influence space weather.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While solar flares are intense emissions of electromagnetic radiation often associated with active regions and sunspots, they are *not always* accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  CMEs are large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona, and while they frequently occur alongside flares,  the relationship isn't one of absolute dependence.  The statement incorrectly implies a causal link that isn't always true.

Statement 2 is correct. Solar winds are a constant stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun's corona. Their speeds indeed exceed one million miles per hour, and their interaction with Earth's magnetosphere significantly impacts space weather, influencing phenomena like auroras and geomagnetic storms.  The statement accurately describes the solar wind and its effects.


**10. With reference to lab-grown diamonds and Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs), consider the following statements:**

1. Lab-grown diamonds are created using only the High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) method.
2. DMFCs utilize methanol as a liquid fuel, offering high energy density and compact system design compared to batteries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lab-grown diamonds are produced using two primary methods: High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). The statement omits a significant method of diamond synthesis.

Statement 2 is correct. DMFCs directly convert the chemical energy of methanol into electricity. Methanol, being a liquid fuel, offers advantages in terms of ease of transportation and storage. DMFCs also demonstrate high energy density relative to batteries and can be designed to be relatively compact and lightweight for their power output.  The statement accurately highlights the advantages of DMFCs.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the complexity of creating highly nuanced and difficult questions while maintaining a factual basis and avoiding obvious answers, the number of questions generated will be fewer than might be expected from the volume of text.  The focus is on quality over quantity to meet the difficulty and originality requirements.


**1. With reference to Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT), consider the following statements:**

1. MRT is primarily used to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from a mother to her child, where the mother carries mitochondrial DNA mutations.
2.  Both Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) techniques involve removing the mother's nucleus from her egg and transferring it to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MRT aims to prevent the inheritance of mitochondrial diseases by replacing the mother's faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor. This allows the mother to have a genetically related child without passing on the mitochondrial disease.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both MST and PNT are MRT techniques, only MST involves removing the mother's nucleus and transferring it to a donor egg.  PNT differs significantly;  both the mother's egg and a donor egg are fertilized, and then the pronuclei (containing the genetic material from both parents) are transferred from the mother's fertilized egg to the donor's enucleated fertilized egg.  The crucial distinction lies in the timing and the components transferred.  The second statement incorrectly conflates the procedures.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding mRNA vaccines:**

1.  mRNA vaccines utilize a copy of messenger RNA (mRNA) to trigger an immune response by directly altering the recipient's DNA.
2.  A key challenge in mRNA vaccine development is the inherent instability of mRNA, making it prone to degradation before it can elicit an immune response.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  mRNA vaccines work by introducing mRNA coding for a viral protein (e.g., the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2). The mRNA is translated into the protein within the recipient's cells, triggering an immune response. Crucially, the mRNA *does not* integrate into the recipient's DNA; it is broken down and eliminated after protein synthesis. The statement misrepresents the mechanism of action.

Statement 2 is correct. mRNA is inherently unstable and susceptible to degradation by enzymes called nucleases. This instability presents a major hurdle in mRNA vaccine development, necessitating careful design and delivery systems (like lipid nanoparticles) to protect the mRNA and ensure its effective delivery to cells.


**3. With reference to  Gene Drive Technology (GDT), consider the following statements:**

1. GDT modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns by increasing the probability of specific genes being passed on to subsequent generations.
2. GDT relies solely on the CRISPR-Cas9 system for gene editing, excluding other techniques like ZFNs and TALENs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GDT is a genetic engineering technique designed to bias inheritance patterns, ensuring that a specific gene (or set of genes) is inherited with a higher probability than predicted by Mendelian genetics. This allows for the potential spread of a modified gene within a population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While CRISPR-Cas9 is a commonly used gene editing tool in GDT, the technology is not limited to this system. Other gene editing techniques, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), can also be employed in gene drive systems. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of GDT.


**4. Consider the following statements about  Sickle Cell Disease (SCD):**

1. SCD is a genetic condition characterized by a modification in the shape of red blood cells from a smooth, doughnut shape into a crescent or half-moon shape, primarily affecting oxygen transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SCD is indeed a genetic blood disorder resulting in abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle-shaped), impairing oxygen transport and leading to various health complications.  The description accurately reflects the core pathology of the disease.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to eliminate SCD by 2047, not 2030. This statement contains an inaccurate timeframe, making it incorrect.


**5. With reference to  Xenotransplantation, consider the following statements:**

1. Xenotransplantation involves transplanting organs from genetically modified pigs into humans due to the anatomical similarity between pig and human organs.
2.  A major challenge in xenotransplantation is the potential for the recipient's immune system to reject the transplanted organ, necessitating lifelong immunosuppressant drugs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Xenotransplantation utilizes organs from other species (often pigs) because of the anatomical similarities to human organs. Genetic modification of the donor animal is essential to minimize immune rejection.

Statement 2 is correct.  Immune rejection is a significant obstacle in xenotransplantation.  The recipient's immune system recognizes the transplanted organ as foreign and mounts an attack, necessitating the use of immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection.  However, lifelong immunosuppression carries its own risks.


These five questions provide a diverse range of difficulty and assess various cognitive skills related to the provided text.  Remember that creating high-quality, difficult MCQs requires careful consideration of distractor options and the precise wording of statements.


**1. With reference to Superconductivity, consider the following statements:**

1. The Meissner Effect describes the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor when cooled below its critical temperature (Tc).
2.  Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in 2011, paving the way for room-temperature applications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Meissner Effect is a fundamental characteristic of superconductivity where a magnetic field is completely expelled from the interior of a superconductor as it transitions to the superconducting state below its critical temperature (Tc). This expulsion creates a perfect diamagnetic response.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Heike Kamerlingh Onnes is credited with the discovery of superconductivity, but this groundbreaking discovery occurred in 1911, not 2011.  While significant advancements have been made since then, achieving room-temperature superconductivity remains a major challenge in the field. The year 2011 is a distractor designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the timeline of scientific discoveries.  The statement plays on the recency bias, making it seem plausible to those not intimately familiar with the history of superconductivity.


**2. With reference to Semiconductors, consider the following statements:**

1.  Elemental semiconductors, such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), are composed of a single species of atom, while compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), are composed of two or more elements.
2. An N-type semiconductor predominantly carries current via positively charged "holes," while a P-type semiconductor carries current primarily through negatively charged electrons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The description correctly differentiates between elemental and compound semiconductors based on their atomic composition. Elemental semiconductors are made of a single type of atom (e.g., silicon or germanium), while compound semiconductors are formed from a combination of two or more different elements (e.g., gallium arsenide). This is a fundamental concept in semiconductor physics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  It reverses the roles of electrons and holes in N-type and P-type semiconductors. N-type semiconductors are created by doping with elements that contribute extra electrons, leading to electron-dominated current flow. Conversely, P-type semiconductors are formed by doping with elements that create "holes" (electron deficiencies), resulting in current flow primarily through these holes.  This reversal serves as a potent distractor, relying on the candidate's potential confusion regarding the terminology and the underlying mechanisms of charge carrier movement in doped semiconductors.


**3. With reference to Rare Earth Elements (REEs), consider the following statements:**

1.  REEs are a group of 17 elements, including scandium and yttrium, and the 15 lanthanides, all characterized by similar silvery-white, soft, and heavy metallic properties.
2. The extraction of REEs from Red Mud, a toxic byproduct of aluminum extraction, offers a sustainable approach to REE sourcing, with strategies focusing solely on REE extraction or encompassing all metals present in the Red Mud.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition accurately describes REEs as a group of 17 elements encompassing scandium, yttrium, and the 15 lanthanides. These elements share similar chemical and physical properties, often leading to their co-occurrence in geological deposits. This is a standard definition used in material science and geochemistry.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The statement accurately reflects the current research and development efforts aimed at recovering REEs from Red Mud.  The two extraction strategies—either focusing exclusively on REEs or extracting all metals present, including REEs—are viable approaches being actively explored to mitigate the environmental impact of Red Mud and secure a more sustainable source of REEs. The description of the process and the strategies involved makes the statement less prone to simple recall-based errors.


**4. With reference to Vanadium, consider the following statements:**

1. Vanadium is primarily extracted from titanomagnetite, accounting for approximately 88% of global vanadium production, and is classified as a transition metal, bridging the gap between metals and non-metals on the periodic table.
2. Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) utilize vanadium ions in four different oxidation states as active materials, offering a longer lifespan compared to lithium-ion batteries, but with a higher initial installation cost.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While titanomagnetite is a significant source of vanadium, the claim that it accounts for 88% of global production is an exaggeration and a potential distractor. Vanadium is found in various minerals, and the precise percentage from titanomagnetite varies. The classification of vanadium as a transition metal is correct, reflecting its position and properties within the periodic table.  The statement is designed to test the candidate's ability to identify both correct and incorrect information within a single statement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) accurately highlights their working mechanism, utilizing vanadium ions' multiple oxidation states for energy storage. The comparison with lithium-ion batteries concerning lifespan and initial cost is also factually accurate. This statement offers a more specific and less easily recalled piece of information.


**5. With reference to Lab-Grown Diamonds, consider the following statements:**

1. Lab-grown diamonds, also known as cultured diamonds or synthetic diamonds, are created through the High-Temperature, High-Pressure (HTHP) method, using graphite as the diamond seed, and the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method, which involves a diamond seed placed in a carbon-rich gas environment to form diamonds.
2.  Lab-grown diamonds possess identical physical and chemical properties to natural diamonds, are more affordable, environmentally friendly due to reduced environmental damage during production, and are used in electronics as heat spreaders for high-power laser diodes and transistors due to their excellent thermal conductivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The statement accurately describes the two primary methods used for growing diamonds in a laboratory setting: HTHP (High-Temperature, High-Pressure) and CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition). The description of the processes is accurate, and the mention of graphite as a seed in HTHP is a specific detail that tests detailed knowledge.

Statement 2 is also correct. Lab-grown diamonds are chemically and physically identical to natural diamonds.  Their affordability, reduced environmental impact compared to mined diamonds, and applications in electronics as high-thermal-conductivity heat spreaders are all accurate aspects of their properties and uses.  The multiple aspects covered within the statement increase the difficulty level.


**6. With reference to Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), consider the following statements:**

1.  Giant magnetoresistance (GMR) is a phenomenon where the electrical resistance of a conductor is significantly affected by magnetic fields in adjacent materials; when materials are magnetized in the same direction, electrical resistance is high, and vice-versa.
2. Graphene, a two-dimensional single-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice structure, extracted from graphite, displays an anomalous giant magnetoresistance (GMR) at room temperature, as discovered by Nobel laureate Andre Geim.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. It incorrectly states the relationship between magnetization direction and electrical resistance in GMR.  In GMR, when the adjacent magnetic layers are aligned (parallel magnetization), the resistance is low. When they are anti-parallel, the resistance is high. This is a crucial detail in understanding the functionality of GMR devices.  The reversal of this relationship acts as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of graphene and its anomalous GMR behavior at room temperature, along with the mention of Andre Geim's discovery, is factually accurate. This statement emphasizes the application of GMR in a specific context, making it challenging for candidates who only have a superficial understanding of the topic.


**7. With reference to Radiometric Dating, consider the following statements:**

1. Carbon-14, with a half-life of 5,700 years, is a stable isotope used in radiometric dating to determine the age of objects older than approximately 50,000 years, while Calcium-41, with a longer half-life of 99,400 years, can be used to date older objects using Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA).
2.  Radiometric dating, a method for determining the age of objects based on the presence of radioactive isotopes, cannot be used to determine the age of non-living things like rocks, as the method relies on the absorption and decay of isotopes within living organisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While ALPS does remove strontium and caesium, which are major contributors to the radioactivity,  it uses a series of *chemical* reactions, not solely physical processes, to achieve this separation.

Statement 2 is correct. ALPS is a system that uses chemical processes to remove radionuclides. The statement about prior removal of tritium is consistent with the information presented in the text.


**6. With reference to  Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs), consider the following statements:**

1. FBRs use slow neutrons to induce fission in fissile material like uranium-235, converting fertile material like plutonium-239 into new fissile material. Liquid sodium is used as a coolant in these reactors.
2. Fast Breeder Reactors are advanced reactors that use fast neutrons to breed more fissile material than they consume.  They utilize non-moderating coolants such as liquid sodium and can be refueled with bred fissile material.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Thorium reactors use *thorium-232* as the primary fertile material, which is converted into the fissile isotope *uranium-233*.  Furthermore, thorium reactors are known for producing *less* long-lived radioactive waste compared to uranium-based reactors.

Statement 2 correctly describes the working principle of thorium reactors, including the conversion of thorium-232 to uranium-233 and the existence of MSRs as a specific type of thorium reactor.


**8. With reference to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), consider the following statements:**

1. SMRs are large-scale nuclear fission reactors designed for on-site construction, providing high power output, and typically using a boiling water reactor (BWR) design.  They are known for their complex and lengthy construction processes.
2. SMRs are small nuclear fission reactors designed to be factory-built, shipped to operational sites, and used to generate power or for other applications.  They are characterized by their modular design, allowing for scalable power output.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to the specified format and criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the examinee's background.  I've aimed for a "difficult" level by incorporating nuanced details and plausible distractors.


**1. With reference to Graphene, consider the following statements:**

1. Graphene is a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon, consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.
2.  Graphene's exceptional thermal conductivity stems primarily from its strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms, enabling efficient phonon transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Graphene's structure is indeed a single layer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice, making it a two-dimensional allotrope. This unique structure is the foundation of its exceptional properties.

Statement 2 is also correct. While several factors contribute to graphene's high thermal conductivity, the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms are crucial. These bonds allow for efficient transport of phonons (lattice vibrations), the primary carriers of heat in solids.  Other factors such as the lack of impurities and the unique electronic structure also play a role, but the strong covalent bonding is a fundamental reason.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding radiometric dating:**

1. Calcium-41, with a half-life of approximately 100,000 years, is a more frequently occurring radioisotope than carbon-14, making it suitable for dating older materials.
2.  The Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) technique is used to measure the abundance of carbon-14 in organic materials for dating purposes, but its application is limited to materials younger than approximately 50,000 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but imprecise. While nanohybrids *are* formed by combining at least two different nanoparticles and are generally less than 8 nm, specifying that their size is *always* less than 10 nm is too restrictive.  The exact size range can vary depending on the specific composition and synthesis methods.

Statement 2 is correct and accurately describes the dual functionality of certain hybrid nanoparticles in cancer diagnostics and treatment.  The photoacoustic and photothermal properties are key to their application in generating ultrasound waves for detection and heat for targeted therapy.


**5.  Consider the following statements concerning Supercritical Carbon Dioxide:**

1. Researchers at IIT-Madras have demonstrated that supercritical carbon dioxide can be effectively used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from depleted oil and gas reservoirs, but it is not suitable for simultaneous carbon dioxide sequestration.
2.  Supercritical carbon dioxide exists in a fluid state above its critical temperature and pressure, exhibiting properties of both a liquid and a gas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While tantalum possesses the described properties (rare, heavy, ductile, hard, high corrosion resistance),  it's not stated that it is *abundantly* found in Sutlej river sand. The text mentions its *presence* in the sand, which doesn't necessarily equate to abundance.

Statement 2 is largely correct. Tantalum's high melting point and corrosion resistance are key reasons for its use in electronics, semiconductors, and nuclear applications. While it can be considered a *potential* substitute for platinum in some applications due to its high melting point and lower cost,  the statement that it *cannot* substitute platinum in all high-temperature applications is too broad. The suitability of a substitute depends on the specific requirements of the application.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding  Superconductivity:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Meissner effect is a defining characteristic of superconductivity, where the material expels magnetic fields. This is a significant difference from simple perfect conductivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Superconductivity is not a universal property of all metals. It only occurs in specific materials under specific conditions (low temperatures, usually). The text mentions examples like mercury, lead, aluminum, etc., illustrating that it's not a property of every metal.  The statement’s claim that superconductivity is observed in *all* metals is false.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', challenging accurate recall and nuanced understanding.

**1. With reference to mRNA vaccines, consider the following statements:**

1.  mRNA vaccines, unlike DNA vaccines, do not integrate their genetic material into the host cell's genome.
2.  The development and production process of mRNA vaccines is generally faster than that of traditional viral vector vaccines due to well-understood mRNA synthesis processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  mRNA vaccines operate by introducing mRNA into cells, which are then translated into the desired protein (e.g., a viral spike protein). The mRNA does not integrate into the host genome and is degraded after its use.  This contrasts with DNA vaccines, which involve the integration of DNA into the host genome, raising concerns about long-term effects.

Statement 2 is also correct. The production of mRNA vaccines is significantly faster than traditional methods that rely on growing viruses or bacteria. The mRNA sequence is synthesized directly, and the process is well-established, making it a rapid and scalable technology. Traditional methods involve complex cell culture, purification, and quality control steps that can be lengthy and prone to delays. The speed of mRNA vaccine development was a crucial factor in the rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT):**

1.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) involves transferring the mother's pronucleus into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, while the donor's pronucleus is discarded.
2.  Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) involves fertilizing both the mother's egg and a donor egg separately before transferring the mother's pronuclei into the enucleated donor zygote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MST involves the transfer of the *entire maternal spindle* (containing the nucleus and associated genetic material) to the enucleated donor egg. The statement incorrectly specifies only the pronucleus. While the pronucleus is part of the spindle, the entire spindle structure is crucial for the process.

Statement 2 is correct. PNT accurately describes the procedure:  both eggs are fertilized independently, pronuclei are extracted from both, and the mother's pronuclei are transferred to the enucleated donor zygote. This method differs from MST in the timing of the nuclear transfer (after fertilization in PNT, before in MST).  The distinction is biologically significant, influencing the potential for mitochondrial DNA mixing and other factors.


**3. With reference to immune responses, consider the following statements:**

1.  Humoral immunity is primarily mediated by antibodies produced by B cells, leading to the neutralization of pathogens in extracellular fluids.
2.  Cellular immunity is solely dependent on cytotoxic T cells directly killing infected cells and does not involve other immune cells.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Humoral immunity is indeed primarily mediated by B cells producing antibodies that circulate in extracellular fluids. These antibodies neutralize pathogens, prevent their entry into cells, and mark them for destruction by other immune cells.  This is a core component of the adaptive immune response.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cellular immunity involves a complex interplay of several cell types, not just cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and regulatory T cells all play crucial roles in coordinating and regulating cellular immune responses. Cytotoxic T cells are essential effectors, but the response is far more intricate than the statement suggests.  The participation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in activating T cells is also a key component of cellular immunity.


**4. With reference to gene silencing, consider the following statements:**

1.  RNA interference (RNAi) utilizes small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to degrade or block mRNA molecules, preventing protein synthesis.
2.  Dicer is an enzyme involved in gene expression, responsible for transcribing DNA into mRNA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. RNAi is a key mechanism for gene silencing, utilizing siRNAs and miRNAs to target and either degrade or block the translation of specific mRNA molecules. This process effectively silences gene expression post-transcriptionally.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Dicer is not involved in gene expression (i.e., the transcription of DNA to mRNA). Dicer is an RNase enzyme that processes long double-stranded RNA molecules into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).  Therefore, Dicer's role is in the RNAi pathway, a mechanism of *gene silencing*, not gene expression.  The enzyme responsible for transcription of DNA to mRNA is RNA polymerase.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding Genome Editing techniques:**

1.  CRISPR-Cas9 utilizes guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where it creates a double-stranded break, initiating DNA repair mechanisms.
2.  Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) are examples of non-targeted genome editing methods that introduce random mutations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is a correct description of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.  The guide RNA provides the specificity for targeting a particular DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme creates a double-stranded break, triggering the cell's DNA repair machinery.  This repair process can be harnessed for gene editing purposes, either by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR).

Statement 2 is incorrect. ZFNs and TALENs are examples of *targeted* genome editing methods.  Unlike non-targeted methods (such as random mutagenesis), they employ specific DNA-binding domains to direct nucleases to precise locations in the genome, enabling precise gene modifications.  While off-target effects can occur, their primary mechanism is targeted gene editing.


**6. With reference to Gene Drive Technology, consider the following statements:**

1. Gene drive systems utilize genetic engineering to create a genetic element that increases its probability of being inherited by offspring, exceeding normal Mendelian inheritance ratios.
2.  Gene drive technology is currently widely used in various agricultural applications to improve crop yields and disease resistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the core principle of gene drive technology.  It uses genetic engineering to bias inheritance, ensuring that a specific gene is passed on to a higher proportion of offspring than would typically occur through random Mendelian inheritance. This can lead to rapid spread of the modified gene within a population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While gene drive technology holds immense potential for various applications, including agriculture, its widespread use is currently limited due to ethical concerns, potential ecological risks, and ongoing research.  The technology is still under development and faces significant regulatory hurdles before it can be widely deployed in agricultural settings.  Extensive research and risk assessment are needed to ensure responsible application.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While local bodies are mandated to conduct annual assessments and develop the necessary infrastructure, they are *not* restricted to using only their own resources. The rules allow them to engage external agencies for waste management, recognizing the resource constraints faced by many local bodies.  The flexibility in resource utilization is important for practical implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 amendment significantly broadens the scope of EPR to include all stakeholders involved in introducing plastic packaging to the market, thereby ensuring shared responsibility for waste management.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the flexibility allowed to local bodies in managing plastic waste infrastructure and the expanded scope of EPR under the amendment.


**1. With reference to mRNA vaccines, consider the following statements:**

1. mRNA vaccines utilize a copy of messenger RNA (mRNA) to trigger an immune response, instructing the cell to produce a viral protein, typically a spike protein found on the virus's outer membrane.  This protein is then displayed on the cell surface, prompting an immune response.

2.  The mRNA in mRNA vaccines integrates with the host cell's DNA, permanently altering the genetic makeup of the cell to provide long-term immunity.  The modified genetic material is then passed to the next generation of cells and remains in the body indefinitely.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the mechanism of mRNA vaccines. The mRNA instructs the cell to produce a viral protein (like the spike protein in COVID-19 vaccines), which is then presented on the cell surface. This triggers the immune system to produce antibodies, providing immunity.  The mRNA itself is degraded by the cell shortly after the protein is produced; it does not become part of the cell's DNA.  This is a key advantage of mRNA vaccines, as it reduces the risk of unintended genetic modification.


Statement 2 is incorrect. A critical feature of mRNA vaccines is that the mRNA does *not* integrate with the host cell's DNA. It operates solely in the cytoplasm of the cell to direct protein synthesis, and is then broken down.  The idea of permanent genetic alteration is a significant misunderstanding of how mRNA vaccines function. This misconception is a common source of vaccine hesitancy, and it's important to clarify that mRNA vaccines do not alter the recipient's genome. The immunity provided is temporary and requires booster shots to maintain protection.


**2. With reference to  Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT), consider the following statements:**

1. MRT involves replacing faulty mitochondria in a mother's egg or embryo with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg, mitigating the risk of transmitting mitochondrial diseases from the mother to the child.  This procedure ensures that the child inherits nuclear DNA solely from the biological parents.

2. MRT techniques, such as Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT), completely replace the mother's entire nuclear DNA with the donor's nuclear DNA, ensuring the offspring inherits the donor's complete genetic makeup, while only the mitochondria are from the mother.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the core principle of MRT.  The goal is to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases by replacing the mother's faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.  Crucially, the child's nuclear DNA, which carries the majority of the genetic information determining the child's traits and characteristics, remains from the biological parents.  This ensures the child is genetically related to its parents, while avoiding the inheritance of potentially debilitating mitochondrial diseases.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  MRT techniques do *not* replace the mother's nuclear DNA.  The nuclear DNA, containing the vast majority of the genetic material, remains from the intended parents.  Only the mitochondria, which are responsible for energy production within the cell and contain their own separate DNA, are replaced.  The claim that the entire nuclear DNA is replaced is a fundamental misunderstanding of the procedure's mechanics. This would essentially create a child genetically unrelated to the biological parents.


**3. With reference to Adaptive Immunity, consider the following statements:**

1. Adaptive immunity is a slower, more specific immune response that develops after exposure to specific antigens, involving lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) and the production of antibodies. This response creates immunological memory, enabling faster and more effective responses to subsequent encounters with the same antigen.

2. Adaptive immunity is a rapid, non-specific response that is present from birth and involves physical barriers like skin and mucous membranes, phagocytes, and natural killer cells.  This response does not create immunological memory, meaning that the body's response remains the same regardless of prior exposure to the antigen.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines adaptive immunity. It highlights its key characteristics:  it's slower to develop than innate immunity, it's highly specific to particular antigens, it involves lymphocytes (B and T cells) and antibody production, and it creates immunological memory. This memory is crucial for long-term protection against pathogens, allowing for a faster and more robust response upon re-exposure. The development of immunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity, distinguishing it from innate immunity.


Statement 2 describes innate immunity, not adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the body's first line of defense, acting rapidly and non-specifically against a wide range of pathogens.  It does not involve the development of immunological memory.  The description of physical barriers, phagocytes, and natural killer cells are all components of the innate, not the adaptive, immune system.  Confusing these two systems represents a common misunderstanding in immunology.


**4. With reference to  Xenotransplantation, consider the following statements:**

1. Xenotransplantation involves transplanting organs or tissues from a human donor to a non-human recipient. This process often faces challenges due to the significant immunological differences between species, leading to high rates of organ rejection.

2. Pigs are frequently used in xenotransplantation research because their organs are anatomically similar to human organs, and pigs are relatively easy to genetically modify to reduce the risk of immune rejection. The process involves genetic alteration of pig cells to create embryos, raising the genetically modified pigs in a controlled environment, and then transplanting the organ into a human recipient.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Xenotransplantation involves the transplantation of organs or tissues from a *non-human* donor to a human recipient, not the other way around.  The immunological differences between species are a major hurdle, leading to a high risk of organ rejection.  The statement reverses the donor and recipient species, showcasing a common misconception about this complex medical procedure.


Statement 2 accurately explains the rationale behind using pigs in xenotransplantation research and outlines the typical process involved. The anatomical similarity of pig organs to human organs, combined with the relative ease of genetic modification in pigs, makes them attractive candidates for this type of transplantation.  The description of the process—genetic alteration, raising the pigs in a controlled environment, and organ transplantation—is consistent with current research methodologies.  The ease of genetic modification is a key factor in making pigs a suitable model.


**5. With reference to  the Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following statements:**

1. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how slowly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels after consumption, ranking foods on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose having a GI of 100.  Foods with a high GI cause a rapid and significant increase in blood sugar levels, while foods with a low GI cause a slow and gradual increase.

2.  The Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the Glycemic Index (GI) and the amount of carbohydrates in a food serving to estimate the impact of a food on blood sugar levels.  A high GL indicates that a food serving will cause a large increase in blood sugar, whereas a low GL indicates a small increase.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the GI does rank foods on a scale of 0-100 with pure glucose at 100, the description of its function is slightly off.  The GI measures how *quickly* a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels, not how *slowly*.  High GI foods cause a *rapid* rise in blood sugar, whereas low GI foods cause a *slower* rise. The statement incorrectly inverts this relationship.


Statement 2 is correct.  The Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive measure that takes into account both the GI and the quantity of carbohydrates in a serving.  It provides a better indication of the overall impact of a food on blood sugar levels, considering both the speed and the magnitude of the glucose response.  This is a crucial distinction, as a food might have a high GI but a low GL if the serving size contains a small amount of carbohydrates.


**6. With reference to  Avian Influenza, consider the following statements:**

1. Avian influenza, or bird flu, is caused by infection with avian influenza (flu) Type B viruses, which are categorized into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). High pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry, while low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses cause mild or no disease.

2.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) is an international organization collaborating to improve animal health.  National Action Plans, like India's revised National Action Plan for Prevention, Control, and Containment of Avian Influenza (2021), outline actions for handling avian influenza outbreaks and provide guidance on pre-outbreak preparedness.  Vaccination against HPAI is permitted in India as a key strategy for disease control.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. Avian influenza is caused by avian influenza Type *A* viruses, not Type B viruses.  The categorization into subtypes based on H and N proteins is correct, as is the distinction between HPAI and LPAI viruses. The error in the virus type is a significant factual inaccuracy.


Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While WOAH's role and the existence of national action plans are accurate, the assertion that vaccination against HPAI is permitted in India is false.  India's policy prohibits vaccination against HPAI as a control measure.  This highlights a crucial difference in strategies employed in different countries to manage avian influenza outbreaks.


**7. With reference to  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ZFNs and TALENs are both examples of *targeted* gene editing technologies. They utilize engineered proteins to bind to specific DNA sequences and introduce double-strand breaks, leading to targeted gene modifications. The statement mistakenly classifies them as non-targeted, which is a characteristic of older, less precise methods like random mutagenesis.

Statement 2 is correct. CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary targeted gene-editing technology.  Its precision stems from the use of a guide RNA molecule that complements the target DNA sequence. This guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme, acting as molecular scissors, to the precise location for DNA cleavage and subsequent modification. The statement accurately describes the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9.


**4. With reference to Types of DNA, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a *circular*, not linear, DNA molecule.  It is found within the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, and is inherited *maternally*, not paternally.  The statement contains errors regarding both the shape of mtDNA and its mode of inheritance.

Statement 2 is correct. Microsatellite DNA, also known as short tandem repeats (STRs), is characterized by short, repeating sequences of 1-6 base pairs. These repeats are found throughout the genome and exhibit high variability in the number of repetitions between individuals. This high variability makes microsatellite DNA particularly useful in forensic science and genetic studies.

2.  Transfer RNA (tRNA) directly synthesizes proteins from amino acids during translation.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. mRNA plays a central role in gene expression by carrying the genetic information transcribed from DNA to the ribosomes.  At the ribosomes, this information is translated into a sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that folds into a functional protein.  This statement accurately describes the function of mRNA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While tRNA is crucial for protein synthesis, it does not directly synthesize proteins. tRNA molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome during translation. The ribosome then uses the information encoded in the mRNA to assemble the amino acids into a polypeptide chain according to the mRNA sequence.  tRNA acts as an adaptor molecule, bringing the correct amino acid to the ribosome based on the mRNA codon.


**6. With reference to Epigenetics, consider the following statements:**

1.  Epigenetic modifications alter the underlying DNA sequence, leading to permanent changes in gene expression.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CRISPR-Cas system is derived from the adaptive immune system of *bacteria* and *archaea*, not viruses. These organisms use the CRISPR system to defend against invading viruses and other genetic elements by incorporating fragments of viral DNA into their own genomes, which then act as a memory of past infections.  The statement incorrectly attributes the origin of CRISPR to viruses.

Statement 2 is correct. Guide RNA (gRNA) is a fundamental component of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.  It is a short RNA sequence designed to be complementary to the target DNA sequence.  This complementarity allows the gRNA to guide the Cas9 enzyme to the precise location on the DNA for cleavage, enabling precise gene editing.


**9. With reference to Gene Drive Technology, consider the following statements:**

1. Gene drive systems always lead to the complete elimination of the targeted gene from a population.
2.  Gene drive technology utilizes genetic engineering to increase the inheritance of a specific genetic trait beyond Mendelian inheritance patterns.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While gene drive systems aim to spread a particular genetic trait rapidly through a population, they don't always result in the complete elimination of the targeted gene.  Factors such as the presence of multiple alleles, resistance mechanisms, or ecological complexities can influence the outcome.  The statement oversimplifies the potential outcomes of gene drive.

Statement 2 is correct. Gene drive technology is a powerful genetic engineering tool that manipulates inheritance patterns. It uses genetic elements designed to increase their own transmission rate beyond the typical 50% chance in Mendelian inheritance. This allows for the rapid spread of a specific genetic trait within a population, even if it confers a fitness disadvantage.  This statement accurately captures the core function of gene drive.


**10. With reference to Stem Cells, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Stem cells are defined by their ability to self-renew (divide and produce more stem cells) and differentiate (develop into specialized cell types).  While some stem cells have limited differentiation potential (multipotent), others are pluripotent (can differentiate into all cell types of the body) or even totipotent (can develop into a complete organism).  The statement incorrectly restricts the differentiation capabilities of stem cells.

Statement 2 is correct. Regenerative medicine is a rapidly evolving field that leverages the unique properties of stem cells to repair or replace damaged tissues or organs.  Embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are all actively being investigated for their potential therapeutic applications.  The statement accurately reflects the role of stem cells in regenerative medicine.

1.  The Glycemic Index (GI) ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0 to 100 based on their ability to raise blood glucose levels compared to pure sucrose (which has a GI of 100).
2.  Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates in a food serving to estimate the postprandial blood glucose response.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly uses sucrose as the reference point.  The Glycemic Index (GI) uses pure glucose, not sucrose, as the reference point (GI of 100).  Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, and its glycemic response differs from that of pure glucose. This factual error makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Glycemic Load (GL) is a more comprehensive measure than GI because it takes into account both the GI of a food and the amount of carbohydrates in a typical serving. This provides a more accurate reflection of how much a particular food serving will raise blood glucose levels.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission aims to eliminate SCD by 2047, its strategy is not limited to prevention.  It incorporates a three-pillar approach encompassing health promotion, prevention, and holistic management and continuum of care.  The statement inaccurately restricts the mission's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. SCD

**1. With reference to Genome Editing (GE), consider the following statements:**

1.  SDN1 and SDN2 methods of GE involve the introduction of alien genetic material, resulting in genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
2.  The development of low-pungent mustard using CRISPR/Cas9 technology is an example of GE that does not involve the introduction of foreign genes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SDN1 and SDN2 methods of genome editing, unlike SDN3, do *not* involve the introduction of alien genetic material. They utilize site-directed nucleases to make precise changes within the organism's existing DNA. The resulting organism is indistinguishable from conventionally bred varieties.  The introduction of foreign genes is a characteristic of genetic modification (GM), a distinct process from genome editing.

Statement 2 is correct. The creation of low-pungent mustard using CRISPR/Cas9 technology exemplifies a successful application of genome editing.  CRISPR/Cas9 is a precise gene-editing tool that modifies the existing genes of the plant to reduce glucosinolate levels, without introducing any external DNA. This makes it different from genetically modified organisms where foreign DNA is inserted.  The resulting mustard variety is essentially a modified version of the original Indian mustard variety, 'Varuna'.


**2. With reference to the Chandrayaan-3 mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  Chandrayaan-3 was the first mission to successfully soft-land near the lunar South Pole, making India the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon.
2.  The primary objective of Chandrayaan-3 was to conduct a comprehensive survey of the lunar far side, including the permanently shadowed regions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the lunar South Pole, a feat previously unattempted.  This accomplishment placed India among the elite group of nations – the US, Russia, and China – that have successfully soft-landed on the Moon.  Japan's SLIM mission also achieved a landing shortly after but Chandrayaan-3 was the first to achieve a soft landing near the South Pole.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Chandrayaan-3 did explore the lunar South Pole, its primary objective was not a comprehensive survey of the lunar far side. The focus was on demonstrating a soft-landing capability near the South Pole, a region of significant scientific interest due to the potential presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters.  Chandrayaan-1 had previously mapped both the near and far sides of the moon.


**3. With reference to the Aditya-L1 mission, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aditya-L1 is positioned at the L2 Lagrange point, providing a stable platform for continuous observation of the Sun.
2.  The mission carries seven payloads, including instruments to study solar wind, solar flares, and the Sun's upper atmosphere.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aditya-L1 is situated at the L1 Lagrange point, not L2.  While both are advantageous locations for solar observation, L1 offers the benefit of uninterrupted solar viewing, whereas L2 provides a stable point for observing deep space.  The choice of L1 for Aditya-L1 was specifically made to enable continuous monitoring of the Sun.

Statement 2 is correct. Aditya-L1 indeed carries a suite of seven scientific payloads. These instruments are designed to study various aspects of the Sun, including solar wind composition and dynamics, solar flares, and the processes occurring in the chromosphere and corona.  The payloads include both remote sensing and in-situ instruments.


**4. With reference to the  National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), consider the following statements:**

1.  NCAP aims to reduce particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations by 20% in 131 cities by 2025-26, with 2017 serving as the base year.
2.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is the primary implementing agency of NCAP at the national level, while City Action Plans (CAPs) are implemented by state governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCAP's target is more ambitious, aiming for a 40% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2025-26, not 20%. The base year remains 2017.  This significant reduction showcases the programme's commitment to improving air quality.

Statement 2 is correct. The CPCB plays a crucial role in overseeing the NCAP at the national level.  However, the actual implementation on the ground is carried out through CAPs developed and implemented by state governments and their respective agencies, including municipal bodies.  This decentralized approach allows for tailored solutions to address the specific air quality challenges of individual cities.


**5. With reference to  Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules mandate local bodies to conduct a five-year assessment of plastic waste generation and develop infrastructure for waste processing, exclusively engaging producers under the EPR system.
2.  Manufacturers of compostable plastics are required to report the quantity of commodities introduced into the market and pre-consumer waste generated to the CPCB.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While local bodies are indeed mandated to conduct an annual assessment of plastic waste and develop infrastructure, they are not limited to engaging only producers under the EPR system. They can engage agencies or develop the infrastructure themselves.  The EPR system expands the responsibility, but local bodies retain a key role in waste management infrastructure.

Statement 2 is correct. The amended rules explicitly require manufacturers of compostable or biodegradable plastics to submit reports on their market introduction and pre-consumer waste generation to the CPCB. This ensures transparency and helps monitor the effectiveness of the rules in managing this specific type of plastic waste.


**6. With reference to  Radiometric Dating, consider the following statements:**

1. Carbon-14 dating can be used to accurately determine the age of geological formations that are millions of years old.
2.  Calcium-41, with a half-life of approximately 100,000 years, offers a potential alternative to Carbon-14 dating for materials older than 50,000 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Carbon-14 dating is limited in its application. Its half-life of approximately 5,700 years restricts its use to dating materials that are relatively recent (up to around 50,000 years old).  Geological formations that are millions of years old require other radiometric dating methods that utilize isotopes with much longer half-lives, such as potassium-argon or uranium-lead dating.

Statement 2 is correct.  Calcium-41, possessing a significantly longer half-life than Carbon-14, presents a promising alternative for dating older materials. Its relatively long half-life extends the timeframe for accurate dating beyond the limitations of Carbon-14. The use of Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) enhances the precision of Calcium-41 dating.


**7. With reference to Antimatter, consider the following statements:**

1.  Antimatter is exclusively produced artificially in particle accelerators, with current production limited to a few milligrams due to high costs.
2.  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans utilize antimatter for medical imaging, leveraging the annihilation reaction between positrons and electrons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While particle accelerators are a primary method of producing antimatter, it also occurs naturally in processes like cosmic ray collisions and some radioactive decays. The current production in accelerators is indeed limited, but the scale is nanograms, not milligrams, reflecting the challenges and costs involved.

Statement 2 is correct. PET scans effectively utilize antimatter in the form of positrons.  Positrons, the antiparticles of electrons, are introduced into the body. When they encounter electrons, annihilation occurs, producing gamma rays that are detected to create the medical image. This process provides valuable diagnostic information.


**8. With reference to  Launch Vehicles, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) mission utilizes the spent second stage of the PSLV launch vehicle as an orbital platform.
2.  The Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE-200) is designed to power the upper stage of the GSLV Mk III launch vehicle, using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen as propellants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The POEM-2 mission innovatively repurposes the *fourth* stage (not second) of the PSLV rocket, transforming it into a space-based platform for conducting scientific experiments.  This demonstrates resourcefulness and cost-effectiveness in space exploration.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SCE-200 uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 kerosene, not liquid hydrogen (LH2), as propellants.  The use of RP-1 kerosene makes it a semi-cryogenic engine, distinct from fully cryogenic engines that employ LH2.  The SCE-200 is intended for the LVM3 and future heavy-lift vehicles.


**9. With reference to Solar Phenomena, consider the following statements:**

1.  Solar flares are localized emissions of electromagnetic radiation occurring primarily in the Sun's photosphere, often associated with sunspots.
2.  Solar winds are continuous streams of charged particles originating from the Sun's corona and travel at speeds exceeding one million kilometers per hour, influencing space weather.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Solar flares originate in the Sun's atmosphere, specifically the corona (and chromosphere), not the photosphere.  While they are often associated with sunspots, which are regions of intense magnetic activity, the flares themselves are powerful eruptions of energy in the upper layers of the Sun's atmosphere.

Statement 2 is correct. Solar winds are indeed a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona.  These winds travel at extremely high speeds, exceeding one million kilometers per hour, and interact with planetary magnetospheres, influencing space weather phenomena like auroras and geomagnetic storms.  The speed given in the statement is approximately correct.
