**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Technique                  Description
1. Plant Tissue Culture (PTC)             :   Cultivation of differentiated plant cells on synthetic media
2. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST)       :   Transfer of mother's pronucleus to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria
3. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)             :   Transfer of mother's egg nucleus to a donor egg before fertilization
4. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing           :   Uses zinc finger nucleases to make changes in DNA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) involves the cultivation of *undifferentiated* plant cells, tissues, or organs on synthetic media under aseptic conditions. Option 1 is therefore incorrect.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) accurately describes the transfer of the mother's nucleus (containing the majority of genetic material) to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) correctly describes the transfer of pronuclei (nuclear genetic material from both parents) from the mother's fertilized egg to a donor's fertilized egg with healthy mitochondria.  Option 4 is incorrect because CRISPR/Cas9 uses a different mechanism than zinc finger nucleases; it employs guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA sequences for cutting and editing. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to  IT, Computer, and Cybersecurity, consider the following pairs:**

   Cybersecurity Threat                     Description

4. Sickle Cell Disease                      :   Genetic condition affecting red blood cell shape and oxygen transport

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Meningitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites; it is not primarily caused by viruses. Pair 1 is incorrect. TTS involves low, not high, platelet count. Pair 2 is incorrect. Avian influenza is caused by Type A, not Type B, viruses. Pair 3 is incorrect.  Sickle cell disease accurately describes a genetic condition affecting red blood cell shape and oxygen transport.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.

1.  White Rabbit (WR) Technology                :   Provides millisecond accuracy synchronization for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
2.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Technology :   Uses X-rays to produce detailed images of internal structures
3.  Genome Sequencing (long-read technique)   :   Provides sequences that are difficult to distinguish and assemble
4.  Gene-Drive Technology (GDT)               :   Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

White Rabbit technology provides *sub-nanosecond* accuracy, not millisecond accuracy. Pair 1 is partially correct in that it is used for the LHC, but the accuracy is misrepresented. MRI uses radio waves and magnets, not X-rays. Pair 2 is incorrect. Long-read sequencing provides sequences that are *easier*, not difficult, to distinguish and assemble. Pair 3 is incorrect. Gene-drive technology correctly modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance. Pair 4 is correct. Therefore, only pair 4 is fully correct, and pair 1 is partially correct.  However, given the strict matching criteria, only option (a) is justifiable.


**7. With reference to  Pharmaceuticals, consider the following pairs:**

   Drug Type                                 Characteristic
1. Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)         :   Treats conditions resulting from enzyme excesses

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphene, an allotrope of carbon, possesses high surface area, excellent thermal conductivity, and is used in various applications including energy storage (solar cells, fuel cells), supercomputers, sensors, and biomedical applications.  It's *not* used in pencils; graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is.  Calcium-41 is a rare, long-lived radioisotope with a half-life of 99,400 years, significantly longer than the 5,700-year half-life of carbon-14. Tantalum is a rare, grey, heavy, ductile, and hard metal with extremely high corrosion resistance and a very high melting point, making it suitable for applications in electronics, semiconductors, and nuclear power plants.  White phosphorus is indeed used as a component in fertilizers, but also in military applications as an incendiary agent.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Material           Feature/Application
1. Lab-grown diamonds        :   Created using low pressure, low temperature methods
2. Perovskite solar cells       :   Characterized by low efficiency

(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lab-grown diamonds are created using High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) methods, both involving extreme conditions. Perovskite solar cells are known for their high efficiency and potential for low-cost production. Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) use liquid methanol as fuel, not solid methanol.  Hybrid nanoparticles are usually less than 8 nm in size. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. All options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                      Characteristic/Advantage

2. Ethanol                         :   Less expensive to produce than hydrogen
3. Hydrogen (produced by electrolysis using renewable energy) :   Carbon-neutral
4. Methanol                       :   Non-corrosive

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Biodiesel produces significantly less particulate matter, CO, and hydrocarbons than petroleum diesel, but NOx emissions can be slightly higher. Ethanol is indeed less expensive to produce than hydrogen. Hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewable energy sources is considered carbon-neutral as it produces only water vapor upon combustion. Methanol is toxic and corrosive, not non-corrosive. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.



**4. With reference to alternative energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Concept                 Description/Application
1. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS):   Primarily uses sodium-ion batteries
2. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)     :   Larger and less efficient than traditional nuclear reactors
3. Net Energy Gain (NEG)              :   The energy produced exceeds the energy consumed in its production
4.  Algae Assisted Fuel Cells (AFC)     :   Generate electricity but do not treat wastewater


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) utilize various battery technologies, including lithium-ion and increasingly sodium-ion, but aren't exclusively reliant on one type. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed to be smaller, safer, and more efficient than traditional reactors. Net Energy Gain (NEG) accurately describes a system where the energy output surpasses the energy input for its creation and operation. Algae Assisted Fuel Cells (AFC) are designed to capture carbon dioxide, treat wastewater, and generate power simultaneously. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.



**5. With reference to environmental monitoring and regulation, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Program                        Feature/Objective

4. Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024:  Reduces the minimum thickness of plastic carry bags


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NCAP aims for a 40% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2025-26, not 20%. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024, does indeed increase penalties for water pollution violations. NMCG's recent amendment allows for the discharge of treated effluent into the Ganga under prescribed standards, after exploring reuse options.  The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024, increased the minimum thickness of plastic carry bags, not reduced it. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

RTGs power spacecraft, especially in deep space missions, but not Apollo missions which used other propulsion systems.  Ion thruster engines are indeed used for precise satellite orientation and main propulsion in some robotic missions. RDREs use continuous detonation waves, not deflagrative combustion. SOFIA was an airborne observatory, not ground-based. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to recent scientific advancements, consider the following pairs:**

   Discovery/Technology                  Description/Application

2.  Positronium (Ps)                      :   Has a very long lifetime
3. Steel Slag Road Technology (SSRT)   :   Offers 30% cost savings compared to traditional methods
4. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)             :   Low surface area to volume ratio


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Experiments at CERN have shown that antimatter falls downwards under gravity, not upwards. Positronium (Ps) has a very short lifetime. Steel Slag Road Technology (SSRT) does offer significant cost savings. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a high surface area to volume ratio, not low. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.

3.  GPS Spoofing                       :   Blocks GPS signals
4.  Shallowfake                         :   Uses AI technology to alter media


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Genome editing can use various methods, some of which do not involve foreign genetic material. Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) is based on the totipotency of plant cells, not pluripotency. GPS spoofing manipulates GPS signals, not blocks them. Shallowfakes use conventional methods to alter media, not AI. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. All options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.

Nipah virus can spread through various means, including contaminated food and direct contact, not solely through mosquito bites, rendering (3) incorrect. Avian influenza can affect humans, albeit rarely, making (4) incorrect. Lymphatic filariasis is caused by parasitic worms, not bacteria, making (5) incorrect.  Therefore, only pair (2) is correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genome Editing Technique          Associated Technology/Method
    1. SDN 1                             :   CRISPR/Cas9
    2. SDN 3                             :   Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)
    3. Gene Drive Technology (GDT)     :   Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of genome editing techniques and their associated technologies.  SDN 1 and SDN 2, by definition, do not involve alien genetic material. While CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome editing tool, it can be used in both SDN 1 and SDN 2 approaches depending on the specific application.  Therefore, pairing SDN 1 exclusively with CRISPR/Cas9 is incorrect. Similarly, SDN 3 involves genes of foreign origin, but it's not exclusively associated with ZFNs or TALENs; CRISPR/Cas9 can also be employed in SDN 3.  Gene Drive Technology (GDT) utilizes components like Cas9 enzyme and CRISPR, but  it is not solely defined by or limited to TALENs.  Other nucleases can be used in GDT. The options provided are designed to test the precise understanding of the relationship between the techniques and their associated technologies, rather than a general familiarity.  All the pairings presented are inaccurate reflections of the complex interplay between these advanced gene editing methods.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genetically Modified Crop             Gene of Origin
    1. Bt Cotton                           :   Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
    2. GM Mustard (DMH-11)              :   Bacillus thuringiensis
    3. Bt Brinjal                          :   Solanum melongena

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 3 only

**Explanation:**

This question assesses knowledge of specific genetically modified crops and the source of their introduced genes.  Bt cotton's pest resistance comes from the *Bacillus thuringiensis* bacterium, making option 1 incorrect.  GM Mustard (DMH-11) utilizes genes from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens*, not *Bacillus thuringiensis*, thus option 2 is incorrect.  Bt Brinjal, however, correctly reflects the source of its modified genes as being from within the *Solanum melongena* species itself, indicating the use of a gene from within the same species. Options (a), (b), and (c) are designed as distractors, testing detailed knowledge of the specific genetic modifications in these crops.  The inclusion of a seemingly correct pairing (Bt Brinjal) among incorrect ones increases the difficulty level and demands precise factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genome Sequencing Technique         Characteristic
    1. Short-read sequencing             :   Handles repetitions and loops in DNA easily
    2. Long-read sequencing              :   More effective for counting specific sequences
    3. Aerial metagenomics               :   Direct genetic analysis of air samples

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of different genome sequencing techniques and their applications. Short-read sequencing excels in applications needing the abundance of specific sequences, not handling complex DNA structures easily. Long-read sequencing is better suited for assembling complex genomes due to its ability to read longer stretches of DNA, thus option 2 is incorrect. Aerial metagenomics accurately describes the direct genetic analysis of airborne microbial samples.  Options 1 and 2 are designed to be plausible distractors, playing on the general understanding of the techniques without requiring precise knowledge of their strengths and limitations. The correct answer (3 only) highlights the niche application of aerial metagenomics, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the field.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Technique                                 Application
    1. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST)       :   Treats Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (cTTP)
    2. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)            :   Replaces diseased mitochondria with healthy ones
    3. Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)    :   Creates embryos with parentsâ nuclear DNA and donor mitochondria

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

This question examines the applications of different reproductive and therapeutic techniques. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are both techniques used in Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT), aiming to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases.  Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is a distinct treatment that involves providing replacement enzymes to patients with enzyme deficiencies, not directly related to creating embryos.  Therefore, pairing MST with cTTP treatment is incorrect.  The design of options (a), (b), and (d) aims to mislead by including seemingly plausible but factually incorrect pairings. The correct answer requires a clear understanding of the distinct applications of each technique in the context of genetic and reproductive medicine.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    2.  CAR-T cell therapy                   :   Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance
    3.  Gene-drive Technology (GDT)         :   Targets cancer cells with CD19 protein

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The question tests knowledge of different biotechnologies and their primary applications. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is indeed used in gene therapies to treat Sickle Cell Disease, making option 1 correct.  CAR-T cell therapy primarily targets cancer cells, not altering Mendelian inheritance directly. Gene-drive technology is designed to alter inheritance patterns within a population, not to target specific proteins like CD19 found on cancer cells.  The distractors (options b, c, and d) are created to test detailed knowledge and understanding of the specific mechanisms and applications of each technology. The correct answer requires an ability to differentiate between closely related applications.



**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

    1. Innate Immunity                   :   Develops over time through exposure to diseases
    2. Adaptive Immunity                 :   First line of defense, present from birth
    3. Passive Immunity                  :   Immunity acquired through transfer of antibodies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

This question evaluates understanding of different types of immunity. Innate immunity is the body's initial, non-specific defense mechanism, present from birth, while adaptive immunity develops after exposure to pathogens, making option 1 incorrect. Passive immunity involves the transfer of antibodies, making option 3 correct. The distractor (option 1) is constructed to test the precise definition of innate immunity, while the other options are designed to test the understanding of the differences between different types of immunity.  The correct option requires a thorough grasp of immunology concepts.

    1.  Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)  :   Sickle Cell Disease
    2.  CAR-T cell therapy                 :   Congenital Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (cTTP)
    3.  CRISPR-based gene therapy        :   Various enzyme deficiencies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The question assesses the application of different medical technologies in treating specific diseases.  Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) targets enzyme deficiencies, not Sickle Cell Disease, which is often treated with other methods like bone marrow transplants or CRISPR-based gene editing. CAR-T cell therapy is a cancer treatment, not for cTTP, which is a rare blood clotting disorder often managed with other therapies. CRISPR-based gene therapy has various applications, including treating genetic disorders, but it is not exclusively associated with enzyme deficiencies. This question demands a precise understanding of the application of each technology, differentiating between closely related conditions. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the nuanced understanding of medical applications.

    3. Medical Robot                      :   Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of different types of robots and their applications. Industrial robots are commonly used in automated manufacturing processes, such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in factories. Service robots perform tasks to assist humans in various settings, while medical robots are specifically designed for surgical procedures or other medical applications.  Pairing a surgical robot with industrial robots is incorrect, as is pairing RPA software with medical robots, since RPA is software automation. The distractors are designed to test the ability to differentiate between different types of robots based on their functional applications. The correct answer requires a clear understanding of the categorization of robots.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of nanoparticle properties and applications. Copper Sulphide nanoparticles, with their photothermal properties, can indeed generate heat to kill tumor cells, making option 2 correct. Gold nanoparticles have various applications, but not in carbon dioxide sequestration or enhanced oil recovery. Hybrid nanoparticles combining gold and copper sulphide are not primarily used in pencils or lubricants; those are more typical applications of graphite or other materials.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge of material science applications and the specific properties of different nanoparticles.  The correct answer requires a good understanding of nanotechnology.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)         :  Uranium-233
3. Thorium-Based Breeder Reactor    :  Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) uses natural uranium as its primary fuel, and during operation, it produces Plutonium-239 as a byproduct.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) are designed to breed fissile material, primarily Plutonium-239 from Uranium-238, and also to convert fertile thorium into fissile Uranium-233. Thus, pair 2 is incorrectly matched as it lists Uranium-233 as the primary fuel; Uranium-238 is the fertile material that is converted.  Thorium-based breeder reactors primarily utilize thorium, which is converted into Uranium-233. While they may utilize MOX fuel as a starting point, it's not their defining characteristic. The primary fuel in later stages is the bred Uranium-233. Therefore, pair 3 is also incorrectly matched. Option (a) accurately reflects that only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly include pairs 2 and/or 3, showcasing the importance of understanding the specific fuel cycles and functionalities of different reactor types.


**2. With reference to nuclear reactors, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Component              Function
1. Moderator                         :   Increases the speed of neutrons
2. Coolant                           :   Slows down the speed of neutrons
3. Control Rods                      :   Absorbs neutrons to regulate the reaction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A moderator in a nuclear reactor is a material that slows down the speed of fast neutrons produced during fission, thereby increasing the probability of further fission reactions.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  The coolant's primary function is to remove the heat generated by the fission process, maintaining the reactor's operational temperature. It does not directly affect the speed of neutrons; therefore, pair 2 is also incorrectly matched. Control rods are crucial for reactor safety and control. They absorb neutrons, regulating the rate of the chain reaction and preventing it from becoming uncontrolled. This makes pair 3 correctly matched.  Only option (c) correctly identifies that only pair 3 is correctly matched, highlighting the importance of precise understanding of the function of each component within a nuclear reactor. The other options incorrectly associate functions with components, demonstrating the need for detailed knowledge to avoid common misconceptions in this field.

3. Plutonium-239                   :   Fissile material

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Uranium-235 is a fissile material, meaning it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction by itself.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  Thorium-232 is a fertile material, meaning it can be converted into a fissile material (Uranium-233) through neutron absorption. Thus, pair 2 is incorrectly matched. Plutonium-239 is a fissile material commonly used in nuclear reactors and weapons.  Pair 3 is correctly matched. Only option (c) correctly identifies that only pair 3 is correctly matched, highlighting a crucial distinction between fissile and fertile materialsâa fundamental concept in nuclear science. The incorrect options demonstrate how easily one could confuse these terms, leading to an inaccurate understanding of nuclear fuel cycles and reactor design.


**4. With reference to alternative fuels, consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                       Production Method
1. Ethanol                          :   Transesterification
2. Biodiesel                        :   Fermentation
3. Dimethyl Ether (DME)           :   Gasification of natural gas or coal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because it accurately matches Junk DNA with its definition as DNA lacking a known biological function and Dark DNA with its description as DNA regions difficult to detect during genome sequencing.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the definitions of exons and introns. Exons are coding sequences translated into proteins, while introns are non-coding sequences removed during mRNA processing.


**4. With reference to  'CAR T-cell therapy', consider the following pairs:**

   Step in CAR T-cell Therapy                   Description
1. T Cell Collection                           : Genetically modifying T cells to produce CARs

3. T Cell Expansion                           : Infusing modified T cells back into the patient
4. Infusion of CAR T Cells                    : Culturing modified T cells to increase their numbers
5. Post-infusion Monitoring                  : Assessing the treatment's effect on cancer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly matches steps 2 and 4 with their descriptions.  Genetic modification involves engineering T cells to express CARs, and T cell expansion is the process of culturing these cells to increase their numbers.

Other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the other steps involved in CAR T-cell therapy.


**5. With reference to 'Gene Editing Techniques', consider the following pairs:**

   Technique                                 Characteristic
1. CRISPR-Cas9                               : Uses zinc finger nucleases
2. ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases)             : Site-directed nucleases
3. TALENs (Transcription Activator-like Effector Nucleases):  A type of targeted gene editing
4. SDN 1 and SDN 2                           : Involve foreign genetic material
5. SDN 3                                     : Does not involve alien genetic material


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because it correctly matches ZFNs and TALENs as types of site-directed nucleases and also accurately states that SDN 3 does not involve foreign genetic material.  ZFNs and TALENs are both types of targeted gene editing tools that use engineered nucleases to make precise cuts in DNA.  SDN 1 and 2, unlike SDN 3, do not use foreign genetic material.

The other options incorrectly pair CRISPR-Cas9 with ZFNs, and misrepresent the characteristics of SDN categories.


**6. With reference to 'Biofuel Generations', consider the following pairs:**

   Biofuel Generation                         Source Material
1. First Generation (1G)                     : Algae
2. Second Generation (2G)                   : Non-food crops and waste biomass
3. Third Generation (3G)                     : Food crops like corn and sugarcane
4. Fourth Generation (4G)                    : Genetically engineered crops/organisms
5.  First Generation (1G)                    : Lignocellulosic biomass


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies that second-generation biofuels utilize non-food crops and waste biomass, and that fourth-generation biofuels are derived from genetically engineered organisms.

The other options misrepresent the source materials for the different biofuel generations.  First-generation biofuels are primarily derived from food crops, while third-generation biofuels utilize algae.  Lignocellulosic biomass is a key source for second-generation biofuels, not first-generation.


**7. With reference to 'Types of RNA', consider the following pairs:**

   RNA Type                                   Function
1. mRNA (messenger RNA)                    : Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
2. tRNA (transfer RNA)                       : Catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation
3. rRNA (ribosomal RNA)                      : Transports amino acids to ribosomes during translation
4. snRNA (small nuclear RNA)                : Involved in gene regulation and RNA processing
5. siRNA (small interfering RNA)              : Involved in gene silencing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) accurately describes the functions of mRNA, rRNA, and siRNA.  mRNA carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis; rRNA is a structural component of ribosomes and plays a role in translation; siRNA participates in RNA interference, a process of gene silencing.

The other options misrepresent the roles of tRNA and snRNA. tRNA transports amino acids to ribosomes, and snRNA functions in RNA splicing and processing, not directly in catalysis or translation.


**8. With reference to 'Genome Editing', consider the following pairs:**

   Genome Editing Technique                    Application
1.  CRISPR-Cas9                               : Primarily used in gene silencing
2.  Gene Drive Technology                     :  Modifying genes to alter Mendelian inheritance
3.  Genome Editing                             : Introducing foreign genes into an organism
4.  Genome Sequencing                         : Determining the order of nucleotides in a genome
5.  ZFNs and TALENs                           :  Types of targeted gene editing tools


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) correctly identifies the applications of Gene Drive Technology (altering Mendelian inheritance), Genome Sequencing (determining nucleotide order), and ZFNs and TALENs (targeted gene editing).

CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile tool used in various applications beyond gene silencing.  Genome editing itself is a broader concept and does not inherently imply the introduction of foreign genes.


**9. With reference to 'Immunology', consider the following pairs:**

   Immune System Component                      Role
1. B cells                                     : Produce antibodies
2. T cells                                      : Directly kill infected cells
3.  Macrophages                               : Present antigens to T cells
4.  Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)          : Part of innate immunity only
5.  Adaptive Immunity                           :  Involves immediate, non-specific response



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly matches B cells with antibody production, T cells with the direct killing of infected cells, and macrophages with antigen presentation to T cells.  Macrophages are crucial antigen-presenting cells, activating the adaptive immune response.

Option (d) is incorrect because it inaccurately states that APCs are exclusively part of the innate immune system and that adaptive immunity involves an immediate response.  APCs bridge innate and adaptive immunity, and adaptive immunity is characterized by a slower, specific response.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                  Treatment/Prevention
1. Sickle Cell Anemia                         : Bone marrow transplant
2.  Meningitis                                 : Men5CV vaccine
3.  Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS):  Weight loss drugs
4.  Cancer (some types)                      : CAR T-cell therapy
5.  Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) : Adzynma


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) correctly pairs Sickle Cell Anemia with bone marrow transplant as a cure, Meningitis with the Men5CV vaccine, Cancer (certain types) with CAR T-cell therapy, and cTTP with Adzynma as an approved enzyme replacement therapy.

Weight loss drugs are not a treatment for TTS.  TTS is a rare side effect associated with certain vaccines.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Technique                Description
1. CRISPR/Cas9                           :   Uses RNA interference to silence genes.
2. Gene Drive Technology (GDT)         :   A method for altering the DNA of organisms.
3. Genome Sequencing                    :   Involves identifying the order of nucleotides in a genome.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Genome sequencing accurately describes the process of determining the order of nucleotides in a genome.  Pair 1 is incorrect because CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene editing tool, not a gene silencing technique that uses RNA interference; RNA interference is a separate gene silencing method.  While CRISPR can be *used* for gene silencing, the description is inaccurate. Pair 2 is incorrect; while Gene Drive Technology (GDT) is a method for altering DNA, it's a specific type of genome editing that focuses on spreading specific genes throughout a population, not a general description of genome editing itself.  The description is too broad and applies to other techniques.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission/Technology              Description
1. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)  :  Studies gravitational waves.
2. Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) :   Observes asteroids.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. CAR-T cell therapy uses genetically modified immune cells to target cancer, and a brain-computer interface facilitates communication between the brain and external devices. Pair 1 is incorrect; antimicrobial resistance is a public health concern related to the overuse of antibiotics, it is not a gene editing technology.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Alternative Energy Source/Technology     Description
1. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) :   Uses nuclear fission to generate electricity.
2. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)         :   Advanced nuclear reactors with a smaller size and modular design.

3.  Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopter      :   An indigenous Indian helicopter.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. A hypersonic missile travels at speeds exceeding Mach 5, and the Dhruv is an Indian-made helicopter.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the S-400 is a long-range surface-to-air missile system, not a hypersonic missile.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Genetic Concept/Term                   Description
1. Introns                                 :  Coding sequences in DNA.
2. Exons                                  :   Non-coding sequences in DNA.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Jumping genes, or transposons, are indeed DNA segments that can change their position within a genome. Pair 1 is incorrect; introns are non-coding sequences within genes, while exons are the coding sequences. Pair 2 is incorrect for the same reason.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of RNA                               Function
1. Messenger RNA (mRNA)                   :   Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
2. Transfer RNA (tRNA)                    :   Helps in the process of transcription.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. mRNA carries genetic information for protein synthesis, and rRNA is a structural component of ribosomes. Pair 2 is incorrect; tRNA is involved in translation (carrying amino acids to the ribosome), not transcription (the process of making RNA from DNA).


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Nanotechnology Term/Concept          Description
1. Nanoparticles                          :   Materials with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nm.

1. CRISPR-Cas9                               :   Gene silencing
2. Gene Drive Technology                       :   Mosquito population control
3. Recombinant DNA Technology                :   Production of insulin
4.  Genome Editing (using CRISPR/Cas9)      :   Development of low-pungent mustard
5.  Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) :   Treatment of mitochondrial diseases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful gene-editing tool with applications in gene silencing, effectively "turning off" specific genes. Gene drive technology manipulates genes to increase the inheritance of a specific trait, successfully used to reduce mosquito populations by inducing sterility. Recombinant DNA technology allows for the creation of organisms with new genetic combinations, leading to the production of various therapeutic proteins like insulin.  Genome editing, specifically using CRISPR-Cas9, has been instrumental in developing crops with improved traits, such as the low-pungent mustard variety. Finally, Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) directly addresses mitochondrial diseases by replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones. Each pair accurately reflects a key application or feature of the respective technology.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the technologies involved.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Technique                       Method/Mechanism
1. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation    :   Uses Agrobacterium tumefaciens
2. Particle Bombardment (biolistics)         :   Shoots DNA-coated particles into cells
3. Electroporation                             :   Increases cell membrane permeability
4.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST)          :   Involves replacing the mother's nucleus
5. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)                 :   Transfers pronuclei from mother's egg to donor egg


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe biotechnology techniques and their mechanisms. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation uses the bacterium *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* to transfer foreign DNA into plant cells. Particle bombardment, also known as biolistics, physically delivers DNA-coated particles into cells. Electroporation utilizes electric fields to temporarily increase cell membrane permeability, facilitating DNA entry. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) is a mitochondrial replacement technique that involves removing and replacing the nucleus of an egg. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) is another MRT technique, this time transferring the pronuclei (containing parental genetic material) from a fertilized egg to another egg with healthy mitochondria. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they fail to recognize the accurate matching of all five pairs, indicating incomplete knowledge of the different techniques used in genetic engineering and reproductive technologies.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetic Engineering Concept                  Description
1.  Gene Silencing                             :   Preventing gene expression into protein
2.  Jumping Genes (Transposable elements)   :   DNA segments that move within a genome
3.  Epigenetics                                :   Heritable changes in gene expression without DNA sequence alteration
4.  Genome Sequencing                         :   Determining the order of DNA nucleotides
5.  Recombinant DNA                           :  Artificially created DNA from different sources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs offer accurate descriptions of fundamental concepts in genetic engineering. Gene silencing refers to mechanisms that prevent gene expression. Jumping genes, or transposable elements, are DNA sequences capable of moving within a genome. Epigenetics studies heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. Genome sequencing determines the precise order of DNA nucleotides in a genome. Finally, recombinant DNA is artificially constructed DNA molecules comprised of genetic material from different sources.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, revealing a less-than-complete grasp of these central concepts in biotechnology and molecular biology.


**4. With reference to types of RNA, consider the following pairs:**

   RNA Type                                  Function
1.  mRNA                                      :   Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
2.  tRNA                                      :   Transports amino acids during protein synthesis
3.  rRNA                                      :   Forms part of the ribosome structure
4.  miRNA                                     :   Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation
5.  siRNA                                     :   Induces RNA interference (RNAi)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly link RNA types to their respective functions. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic information transcribed from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosomes during translation. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural component of ribosomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, a crucial mechanism for gene silencing.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they leave out at least one of the correctly matched pairs, indicating a partial understanding of RNA types and their roles in cellular processes.


**5. With reference to  Space Technology, consider the following pairs:**

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are both techniques used in Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT).  MST involves removing the mother's nucleus (containing most of the genetic material) from her egg and transferring it to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria.  PNT involves fertilizing both the mother's and a donor's eggs with the father's sperm, then transferring the pronuclei (containing the genetic material from both parents) from the mother's fertilized egg to the donor's fertilized egg, which has healthy mitochondria.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched as PNT is used for replacing faulty mitochondria in a mother's embryo. Pair 4 is also correct; MRT aims to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from mother to child, and replacing the faulty mitochondria in the mother's egg is a core objective.

Option (a) is incorrect because MST is used in MRT, but it doesn't specifically target mitochondrial diseases in males; it addresses mitochondrial diseases in the mother's egg regardless of the child's sex. Option (b) is incorrect because while PNT is a valid MRT technique, it's not the only correct pair. Option (c) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pair involving somatic cell gene therapy.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Chemical Compound                     Property/Application
1. Ethylene (CâHâ)                       : Used in the treatment of methanol poisoning
2. Liquid Nitrogen                         : Colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and extremely cold
3. Methanol (CHâOH)                     :  A component in fertilisers and food additives
4.  Sodium                               : Recommended daily intake less than 2000 mg/day for adults by WHO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the properties and applications of the named entities. Liquid nitrogen is indeed colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and extremely cold, making option (c) partially correct.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily sodium intake of less than 2000 mg/day for adults, confirming the correctness of pair 4.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  While ethylene is used in artificial ripening of fruits, it is not used in the treatment of methanol poisoning. Ethanol or fomepizole are used for methanol poisoning treatment.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Methanol is not a component in fertilizers or food additives; its use is primarily in industrial applications like synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.  White phosphorus, on the other hand, is used as a component in fertilizers and some cleaning compounds, but this is a different chemical altogether.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology/Concept             Description/Application
1.  Glycemic Index (GI)                    : Measures how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels
2.  MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)      : Uses ionizing radiation to create images
3.  Men5CV vaccine                        : Offers protection against five strains of meningococcus bacteria
4.  TTS (Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome) :  Rare side effect of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately matches the descriptions and applications to the medical technologies and concepts. The Glycemic Index (GI) indeed measures how quickly carbohydrate-containing foods raise blood sugar levels.  The Men5CV vaccine is designed to protect against five strains of meningococcus bacteria. TTS is a rare side effect associated with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (Covishield).

Pair 2 is incorrect. MRI does *not* use ionizing radiation; it uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves.  X-rays, on the other hand, do use ionizing radiation.

**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Avian Influenza Virus Category        Characteristic
1. LPAI (Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza) : Causes severe disease and high mortality in poultry
2. HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) : Causes mild or no disease in poultry
3. H5N1                                   : Subtype of Influenza A virus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. HPAI viruses are known to cause severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry, aligning with the provided information. H5N1 is indeed a subtype of the Influenza A virus, and this is well established.

Pair 1 is incorrect. LPAI viruses are characterized by causing mild or no disease in poultry, not severe disease and high mortality.  That is the characteristic of HPAI.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material/Element                     Property/Application
1.  Graphene                             :  Used in pencils and lubricants
2.  Tantalum                             :  High melting point and corrosion resistance
3.  Calcium-41                           : Half-life of 5,700 years
4. White Phosphorus                     : Used as an incendiary agent in military applications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) correctly matches pairs 2 and 4. Tantalum is indeed known for its high melting point and excellent corrosion resistance, making it suitable for various high-tech applications. White phosphorus is used as an incendiary agent in military ammunition due to its spontaneous combustion in air.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While graphite (from which graphene is derived) is used in pencils and lubricants, graphene itself has far broader applications in energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The half-life of Carbon-14 is 5,700 years; Calcium-41 has a much longer half-life of 99,400 years.  This is a crucial distinction in radiometric dating.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology/Mission              Description/Characteristic
1.  RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) : Uses solar power for spacecraft propulsion
2.  Ion Thruster Engine                    : Used for precise satellite orientation control
3.  Artemis Accords                       : A set of binding international space exploration principles
4.  SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) : Airborne observatory studying infrared light


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer as pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Ion thrusters are indeed used for precise satellite orientation control and for main propulsion in some robotic space vehicles. SOFIA was an airborne observatory specifically designed to study infrared light from above the Earth's atmosphere.

Pair 1 is incorrect. RTGs use radioactive decay to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity; they do not rely on solar power.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Artemis Accords are a set of *non-binding* principles; they are not legally binding international treaties.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                      Property
1. Graphene                     :   Low thermal conductivity
2. Tantalum                     :   High corrosion resistance
3. White Phosphorus             :   Used in fertilisers
4.  Lithium                       : Lowest density of all metals
5.  Carbon Nanotubes           : High surface to volume ratios

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because it accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs.  Tantalum is indeed known for its high corrosion resistance, a key property that makes it valuable in various applications. Lithium is the lightest metal, possessing the lowest density among all metals. Carbon nanotubes, due to their unique structure, exhibit exceptionally high surface-to-volume ratios, leading to their use in diverse applications.

Option (b) is incorrect because it includes White Phosphorus, which while used in some applications, is not primarily associated with fertilizers. The main use of white phosphorus is as an incendiary agent in military applications, though it does have some limited use in other applications. Its inclusion is a distractor playing on its chemical nature.

Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of Carbon Nanotubes with their high surface-to-volume ratio.  It only includes the correctly matched Tantalum and Lithium pairs.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Graphene with low thermal conductivity.  Graphene, in fact, is renowned for its exceptional thermal conductivity, a property that makes it very useful in electronics and other high-heat applications. This is a crucial distractor testing the candidate's knowledge of material properties.  The inclusion of White Phosphorus and omission of Graphene's high thermal conductivity makes this option highly flawed.




**2. With reference to nuclear technologies, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type                 Feature
1. Fast Breeder Reactor        :   Uses Uranium-235 as primary fuel
2. Small Modular Reactor       :   Typically over 1 GW per unit
3. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor: Uses natural uranium as fuel
4. Thorium Reactor             : Primarily uses Deuterium and Tritium
5. Tokamak                       : Uses inertial confinement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are indeed known for their use of natural uranium as fuel and heavy water as a moderator. This is a well-established fact within nuclear technology.

Pair 1 is incorrect because Fast Breeder Reactors primarily use a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides (MOX fuel), not solely Uranium-235.  The use of Uranium-235 is a distractor, playing on the fact that Uranium is a key component of nuclear fuel.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed to be smaller and have a much lower power output than traditional nuclear reactors which typically exceed 1 GW. This is a deliberate distractor aiming to test understanding of reactor scale.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Thorium reactors, while still under development, would utilize thorium as fuel, not deuterium and tritium, which are isotopes of hydrogen used primarily in fusion reactors.  This is a distractor playing on the concepts of fission and fusion.

Pair 5 is incorrect. Tokamaks are a type of magnetic confinement fusion reactor, not inertial confinement.  Inertial confinement fusion uses lasers or particle beams to compress and heat fuel pellets. This is a key distractor focusing on the different approaches to fusion.




**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology              Description
1.  Artemis Accords             :   A set of binding international laws governing space exploration
2.  James Webb Space Telescope: Observes primarily in the radio frequency spectrum
3.  Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator:  Uses solar energy for power generation
4.  Ion Thruster Engine         :   A type of chemical propulsion
5.  SOFIA                        :   A ground-based infrared telescope


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  The Artemis Accords are a set of *non-binding* principles, not laws. The James Webb Space Telescope observes in the infrared and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, not the radio frequency spectrum. Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) use the decay of radioactive isotopes, not solar energy, to generate electricity. Ion thrusters are a form of *electric* propulsion, not chemical propulsion.  Finally, SOFIA was an *airborne* observatory, not a ground-based telescope.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options makes this a challenging question.




**4. With reference to materials science, consider the following pairs:**

   Material                      Application
1.  Lab-Grown Diamonds        : Primarily used for jewelry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. Vanadium is indeed used in vanadium redox flow batteries, and steel slag finds application in road construction due to its properties.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While lab-grown diamonds are used in jewelry, they also have significant industrial applications due to their hardness and other properties.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Graphene is known for its excellent electrical conductivity.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Rare earth elements are not found only in extremely rare minerals; they are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust but are difficult to extract and refine.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                         Description
1.  Superconductivity             :   Resistance to electrical current increases with decreasing temperature
2.  Meissner Effect               :   Expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor
3.  Giant Magnetoresistance     :  Electrical resistance unaffected by magnetic fields
4.  Parthenogenesis               :  Sexual reproduction in plants
5.  Antimatter                     :   Matter that annihilates upon contact with normal matter


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. The Meissner effect accurately describes the expulsion of magnetic fields from superconductors, and antimatter is indeed matter that annihilates upon contact with normal matter.

Pair 1 is incorrect. In superconductivity, resistance to electrical current decreases to zero below a critical temperature.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Giant magnetoresistance describes the change in electrical resistance due to magnetic fields.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Parthenogenesis is a form of *asexual* reproduction.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Gaganyaan Mission              :   Deploying a weather satellite in geostationary orbit
4. PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) :   Utilizing the spent PS4 stage as an orbital platform for experiments related to dark matter


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the Moon's South Pole, making it the first mission to accomplish this feat.  POEM-2 uniquely repurposed the spent fourth stage of the PSLV rocket as a platform for scientific experiments in orbit.  Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (c) is incorrect because Gaganyaan's primary objective is a crewed mission, not deploying a weather satellite. Option (d) is incorrect because Aditya-L1 orbits the L1 Lagrange point, not L2, for continuous solar observation.  The other options contain incorrect pairings.


**2. With reference to space technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Spacecraft/Technology         Description/Feature
1. Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) LEX :   Successfully conducted an autonomous landing test at an altitude of 4.5 km
2.  Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) :   Designed to launch satellites weighing up to 1000 kg into low Earth orbit
3.  Agnibaan SubOrbital Technological Demonstrator (SOrTeD) :  World's first 3D-printed rocket engine using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen
4. Cryogenic Engine CE-20           :   Powers the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle using liquid methane and liquid oxygen


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The RLV LEX demonstrated autonomous landing, a crucial step in reusable launch vehicle technology. The CE-20 cryogenic engine indeed powers the upper stage of the LVM3. Option (a) is incorrect because the Agnibaan SOrTeD uses a 3D-printed semi-cryogenic engine, not a cryogenic engine using liquid hydrogen and oxygen.  Option (c) is incorrect because the SSLV's payload capacity is up to 500 kg, not 1000 kg. Option (d) combines correct and incorrect pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Battery Technology/System           Characteristic
1. Lithium-ion Battery                  :   Uses a solid electrolyte
2. Sodium-ion Battery (SIB)            :   A viable substitute for lithium-ion batteries due to low cost
3. Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) Battery :   Stores energy exclusively as electrochemical energy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Sodium-ion batteries are indeed a cost-effective alternative to lithium-ion batteries. The biodegradable paper supercapacitor, made from seaweed, offers high power density.  Option (a) is incorrect because standard lithium-ion batteries typically use liquid electrolytes, not solid electrolytes. Option (c) incorrectly includes the first pair. Option (d) incorrectly states that ACC batteries store energy *exclusively* as electrochemical energy; they can also store chemical energy.


**4. With reference to alternative energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor/Technology                Feature/Application
1. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)      :   Use gas (helium) for cooling
2. Net Energy Gain (NEG) in nuclear fusion :   Achieved for the first time in a nuclear fusion reaction.
3. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) :   Stores energy using only wind energy
4.  Gravity Battery                     :   Involves lifting and lowering heavy weights to store energy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) utilize gas cooling, a key differentiating feature. Gravity batteries function by the lifting and lowering of weights to store and release energy.  Option (b) is incorrect because  Net Energy Gain in nuclear fusion has been achieved multiple times. Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) includes the incorrect statement about BESS only using wind energy; BESS can utilize various renewable sources, including solar.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Phenomenon                   Description
1. Solar Flare                          :   Continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona
2. Solar Wind                           :   Localized emission of electromagnetic radiation in the Sun's atmosphere
3. Coronal Holes                       :   Dark areas in the solar corona appearing cooler and less dense
4. Photosphere                         :   Deepest layer of the Sun directly observable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Coronal holes are indeed cooler, less dense regions in the solar corona. The photosphere is the deepest observable layer of the Sun. Option (a) is incorrect as solar flares are not a continuous stream of particles; that describes solar wind.  Option (c) incorrectly pairs solar wind with the description of solar flares. Option (d) incorrectly includes the mismatched pairs.


**6. With reference to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), consider the following pairs:**

   ISRO Development/Mission          Characteristic
1. Chandrayaan-2                      :  First successful soft landing on the Moon

4.  PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) :  First demonstration of a gravity assist flyby around the Moon


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Aditya-L1's payload configuration includes both remote sensing and in-situ instruments. The SCE uses LOX and refined kerosene. Option (b) is incorrect because Chandrayaan-2 did not achieve a successful soft landing; Chandrayaan-3 did. Option (c) is incorrect because POEM-2 was the first demonstration of a gravity assist flyby, not around the Moon, but around another celestial body. Option (d) is incorrect because more than one pair is correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health-related Term/Concept          Description
1. Ethylene                             :   Used in artificial ripening of mangoes and is a gaseous plant growth regulator
2.  Optical Tweezers                    :   A tool that uses lasers to trap and manipulate microscopic objects
3.  Microbiome                          :   The genetic material of a single organism
4.  Phage Therapy                       :   A treatment that involves using viruses to target bacteria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ethylene is a plant growth regulator used in artificial fruit ripening. Optical tweezers utilize lasers for manipulating microscopic objects. Phage therapy employs viruses to combat bacterial infections. Option (b) is incorrect because a microbiome refers to the collective genetic material of all microorganisms in a specific environment, not a single organism. Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because three pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to recent developments in science and technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Development/Concept                     Description
1.  Quantum Communication                 :  Transmission of information using classical physics principles
2.  3D Printing Technology                 :  Additive manufacturing process
3.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) Regulation :  Focuses solely on preventing algorithmic biases
4.  Genome Editing                         :  Altering the DNA of organisms using CRISPR/Cas9 technology


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

3D printing is indeed an additive manufacturing process. Genome editing utilizes technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 to modify DNA. Option (b) is incorrect because AI regulation encompasses broader aspects beyond just bias prevention.  Option (c) is incorrect because quantum communication relies on quantum mechanics, not classical physics. Option (d) is incorrect because only two pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                      Associated Entity/Concept
1. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) :   Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme
2. Li-ion Battery                     :   Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery
3. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)      :   Pressurized water cooling
4.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)           :   China's fourth-generation nuclear reactor
5.  Gravity Battery                   :   Electrochemical storage system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched.  The SECI's commissioning of India's largest BESS is indeed linked to the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for BESS development approved by the Union Cabinet.  The other pairs contain mismatches. A Li-ion battery is distinct from a Sodium-Sulfur (Na-S) battery; they are different types of electrochemical storage. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), while advanced, utilize various cooling methods, including gas cooling (as seen in China's example), not exclusively pressurized water cooling. Net Energy Gain (NEG) in nuclear fusion is a separate concept from the type of reactor used in China. Finally, a gravity battery is a mechanical energy storage system, not an electrochemical one. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a factual association.


**2. With reference to Space Technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Satellite/Mission              Characteristic/Event
1. Chandrayaan-3                :   Tidal Locking
2. Aditya-L1                      :   Geosynchronous orbit
3. Gaganyaan Mission             :   Semi-cryogenic engine (SCE)-200
4.  Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) :   Space weather
5. X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSAT): International Space Stations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched.  Chandrayaan-3's landing site is relevant to the concept of tidal locking. The other pairs are incorrect. Aditya-L1 is not in a geosynchronous orbit, while the Gaganyaan mission utilizes the SCE-200 but is not solely defined by it. NavIC is unrelated to space weather, and XPoSAT is a separate mission from international space stations.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects a direct factual link.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Environmental Initiative/Act                  Associated Feature/Outcome
1. National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)       :   Reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 in Varanasi
2. Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024 :   Exemption powers solely with respective states

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is indeed treatable with Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT).  Sickle cell disease affects red blood cells, not white blood cells. The BCG vaccine prevents some forms of TB, but not all, and doesn't guarantee complete prevention. Rare diseases are defined as having a prevalence of *less than* 1 per 1000 population.  Therefore, only option 4 is correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Concept/Technique              Description
1.  Genome Editing                             :   Always involves the insertion of foreign genes.
2.  Gene-drive Technology (GDT)               :   Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance.
3.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST)            :   A technique used in three-parent baby procedures.
4.  Recombinant DNA technology                 :   Exclusively used for plant genetic modification.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Gene-drive technology does modify genes to alter Mendelian inheritance patterns. Maternal spindle transfer is a technique used in mitochondrial replacement therapy, a procedure sometimes associated with "three-parent babies." Genome editing does not always involve foreign genes; some forms modify existing genes. Recombinant DNA technology is not limited to plants; it's used across various organisms. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   IT and Computer Technology                   Description/Application
1.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)                 :   Exclusively used for creating deepfakes.
2.  Web 3.0                                    :   Characterized by centralized data control.
3.  3D Printing                                :   Also known as additive manufacturing.
4.  Facial Recognition Technology              :   Always guarantees 100% accuracy.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. 3D printing is indeed another term for additive manufacturing. AI has many applications beyond deepfakes. Web 3.0 is characterized by *decentralized* data control, not centralized. Facial recognition technology is not always 100% accurate; it has limitations and potential biases. Therefore, only option 3 is correctly matched.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Alternative Energy Technology                  Description/Application
1.  Battery Energy Storage System (BESS)       :   Primarily uses solar energy for storage.
2.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)             :   Produce electricity through nuclear fission.
3.  Net Energy Gain (NEG)                      :   The total energy produced minus the energy consumed.
4.  EV-to-Grid (V2G) Charging                 :   A method for charging electric vehicles.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Small modular reactors use nuclear fission to generate electricity. Net energy gain accurately represents the difference between energy produced and consumed. BESS can utilize various energy sources for storage, not just solar. EV-to-Grid (V2G) charging is a method for bidirectional charging, not just a charging method.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Application
1.  Graphene                   :   Cores of nuclear reactors

3.  Lab-grown diamonds       :   Cutters and industrial tools
4.  Vanadium                   :   Alloys in steel and other metals
5.  Tantalum                   :   Substitute for Platinum in high-temperature applications

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Perovskite materials are indeed used in high-efficiency solar cells due to their tunable bandgaps and potential for low-cost production. Lab-grown diamonds, possessing exceptional hardness and strength, find extensive use as cutters and in various industrial tools and machines.  Vanadium is a crucial alloying element in steel and other metals, significantly enhancing their properties. Tantalum's high melting point and corrosion resistance make it a suitable substitute for platinum in high-temperature applications, where platinum's cost can be prohibitive.

Option (a) is incorrect because Graphene, while possessing many exceptional properties, is not typically used in the cores of nuclear reactors.  The cores usually employ materials with specific nuclear properties and high-temperature resistance, distinct from graphene's primary applications in electronics, energy storage, and biomedical fields.

Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correct matching of vanadium and tantalum.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate pairing of graphene with nuclear reactor cores.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Primary Function
1.  MRI                            :   Uses ionizing radiation for imaging
2.  DMFC                          :   Direct conversion of methanol to electricity
3.  RTG                            :   Generates electricity from solar energy
4.  Ion Thruster                  :   Electric propulsion for spacecraft
5.  Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine :   Relies on deflagrative combustion

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) directly convert the chemical energy of methanol into electricity, making (2) correct. Ion thrusters utilize electric propulsion to accelerate ions, creating thrust for spacecraft, thus (4) is correct.  MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves, not ionizing radiation, for detailed internal body imaging; therefore, (1) is incorrect. RTGs utilize radioactive decay, not solar energy, for electricity generation, making (3) incorrect. The Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine uses continuous detonation, not deflagrative combustion, making (5) incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                      Characteristic
1.  Ethanol                        :   Less expensive to produce than methanol
2.  Biodiesel                     :   Produces higher NOx emissions than petroleum diesel
3.  Hydrogen                       :   Abundant element found in water and hydrocarbons
4.  Methanol                      :   Non-toxic and biodegradable
5.  Lithium-ion batteries           :   Lower environmental impact than sodium-ion batteries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ethanol is indeed generally less expensive to produce than methanol, making statement 1 correct. Hydrogen is the most abundant element and is found in water and hydrocarbons, making statement 3 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect because biodiesel typically produces *lower* NOx emissions than petroleum diesel. Statement 4 is incorrect because methanol is toxic and corrosive.  Statement 5 is incorrect because sodium-ion batteries generally have a lower environmental impact due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium.

**4. With reference to semiconductors, consider the following pairs:**

   Semiconductor Type             Example
1. Intrinsic Semiconductor       :   Gallium Arsenide
2.  Extrinsic P-type Semiconductor:   Silicon
3.  Extrinsic N-type Semiconductor:   Boron
4. Elemental Semiconductor       :   Germanium

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Germanium (Ge) is an elemental semiconductor, meaning it's made of a single type of atom.  The other options are incorrect. Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is a compound semiconductor, not an intrinsic one. Silicon can be intrinsic, but it's more often used as an extrinsic semiconductor (both p-type and n-type). Boron is a dopant used to create p-type extrinsic semiconductors, not an n-type.


**5. With reference to superconductivity, consider the following pairs:**

   Phenomenon                    Description
1. Superconducting State         :   Sudden change from normal conducting state to zero resistance at critical temperature.
2. Meissner Effect                :   Expulsion of magnetic field from a superconductor above its critical temperature.
3. Cooper Pairs                  :   Loosely bound electron pairs responsible for zero resistance at low temperatures.
4. Room-Temperature Superconductor:  Exhibits superconductivity at temperatures above 0Â°C.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A superconducting state is characterized by the sudden transition to zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature (Tc). Cooper pairs, formed by electron pairing, are essential for achieving this zero resistance.  A room-temperature superconductor operates above 0Â°C. The Meissner effect, however, describes the expulsion of a magnetic field *below* the critical temperature, not above it.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology                Description
1. PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2): Uses the spent first stage of PSLV as an orbital platform

(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CE-20 cryogenic engine powers the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle, making statement 2 correct. The Agnibaan SOrTeD utilizes a 3D-printed, semi-cryogenic engine, making statement 5 correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; POEM-2 uses the spent *fourth* stage, not the first. Statement 3 is incorrect; the SCE-200 uses liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene, not liquid hydrogen. Statement 4 is incorrect; the SSLVâs payload capacity is up to 500 kg, not 1000 kg.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                    Advantage
1. Biodiesel                       :   Carbon-neutral fuel source

3. Methanol                        :   High energy density compared to batteries
4. Sodium-ion batteries            :   Higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries
5. Sand Battery                     :   Stores energy as heat using sand's thermal properties


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Biodiesel, when sustainably produced, can be considered carbon-neutral as the CO2 released during combustion is offset by CO2 absorbed during plant growth. Hydrogen combustion produces only water vapor, making it non-polluting. Sand batteries use sand's thermal capacity to store heat energy.  However, methanol does not have a higher energy density than batteries. Sodium-ion batteries generally have a *lower* energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries.

3. National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG):  Prohibits the discharge of treated effluent into the Ganga River
4. Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024:  Introduced the Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024, introduced revised and higher penalties for water pollution violations. The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024, expanded the scope of the Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) system.  The NCAP aims for a 40% reduction, not 20%, and NMCG's recent amendment *allows* treated effluent discharge under specified conditions, it doesn't prohibit it.


**9. With reference to the Artemis Accords, consider the following pairs:**

   Principle                                   Description
1. Peaceful Purposes                          :   Exempts private sector activities from adherence

(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Artemis Accords emphasize the importance of shared exploration infrastructure for enhanced scientific discovery.  The Accords also stress the preservation of historic landing sites and artifacts on celestial bodies.  However, the private sector is not exempt from adherence to the principles.  Registration under the Accords is not mandatory for all space objects, and resource utilization is regulated for sustainable and non-interfering activities.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Substance                      Property/Application
1.  Ethylene gas                  :   Used in cryotherapy
2.  Liquid Nitrogen               :   Permitted for artificial ripening of fruits up to 100 ppm
3.  Methanol (CH3OH)            :   Used in synthetic dyestuffs
4.  Graphene                     :   Used in pencils

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Methanol (CH3OH), also known as wood alcohol, finds applications in the production of synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.  Ethylene gas is permitted for artificial ripening of fruits, but not in direct contact, and its concentration is limited to 100 ppm. Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic fluid used in freezing and transporting food products and in cryotherapy,  not ethylene gas. Graphene, an allotrope of carbon, is used in various applications, including pencils, lubricants, and batteries, not in cryotherapy or artificial ripening. The other options incorrectly link substances with inappropriate properties or applications, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the chemical and technological uses of these materials.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Term/Concept       Description/Application
1.  Glycemic Index (GI)        :  Measures how quickly a food raises blood pressure
2.  Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) :  Caused by influenza B viruses
3.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) : Uses ionizing radiation
4.  Meningitis                  : Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord tissues

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Meningitis is indeed an inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord.  The Glycemic Index (GI) measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood *sugar* levels, not blood pressure. Avian influenza is caused by avian influenza Type A viruses, not type B. MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves, not ionizing radiation (unlike X-rays). The other options present incorrect descriptions or applications, testing the candidate's understanding of these medical terms and their accurate definitions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Hybrid nanoparticles, made of materials like gold and copper sulfide, are indeed used in cancer treatment by generating heat to kill tumor cells and using photoacoustic properties for detection via ultrasound waves. Calcium-41 has a much longer half-life (99,400 years) than the stated 5,700 years, which is the half-life of Carbon-14. RPA is used for automating repetitive office tasks, not complex surgery. White phosphorus weapons are not banned outright, though their use in civilian areas is considered a war crime.  The incorrect pairings in options a, b, and d test the candidate's knowledge of specific properties and applications of these technologies and substances.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Sodium-ion batteries are generally less expensive than lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium. Lithium-ion batteries utilize lithium ions, not sodium ions. Sand batteries are primarily used for thermal energy storage, not powering electric vehicles. Biodiesel is produced through transesterification, not electrolysis.  The incorrect matches test the candidate's knowledge of different battery technologies and their specific characteristics and applications.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biofuel Type                Production Method/Characteristic
1. Ethanol                      :  Produced through pyrolysis
2. Biodiesel                    :   Has the highest energy density among biofuels
3. Methanol                     :  Less toxic than ethanol
4. Hydrogen                     :  Produced via steam methane reforming (SMR)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Hydrogen can be produced via steam methane reforming (SMR), although this process also produces CO2. Ethanol is primarily produced through fermentation. Biodiesel does not have the highest energy density compared to fossil fuels like diesel and petrol. Methanol is significantly more toxic than ethanol. The incorrect pairings test the candidate's understanding of biofuel production methods, characteristics, and comparative properties.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Semiconductor Component      Function/Application
1. Diode                         :   Used as an amplifier in electronic circuits
2. Transistor                    :  Used in rectification of alternating current (AC)
3. Photolithography              :  A process of etching semiconductors
4.  Assembly and Testing (ATMP) :  A stage in semiconductor manufacturing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging (ATMP) is indeed a stage in semiconductor manufacturing. Diodes are primarily used for rectification, not amplification. Transistors are used as amplifiers and switches, not for rectification. Photolithography is a process of printing circuit patterns onto a wafer, not etching. The inaccurate pairings test the candidate's knowledge of semiconductor components, their functions, and the manufacturing process.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing  :   A non-targeted gene editing technique
4.  Gene Drive Technology       :   Used for introducing specific genes into populations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Recombinant DNA technology involves combining DNA from different sources to create new genetic combinations. Gene drive technology is a method for introducing specific genes into populations to modify their characteristics. Gene silencing is the process of reducing or eliminating gene expression, not enhancing it. CRISPR-Cas9 is a *targeted* gene editing technique. The incorrect pairings test the candidateâs understanding of core biotechnology concepts and their precise definitions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune System Component       Function
1.  B Cells                       :   Directly kill infected cells
2.  T Cells                       :   Produce antibodies
3.  Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) :   Present antigens to T cells
4.  mRNA Vaccines                :   Introduce weakened viruses into the body


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) do present antigens to T cells, initiating an immune response. B cells produce antibodies, not directly kill infected cells (that's the role of cytotoxic T cells). T cells don't produce antibodies; B cells do. mRNA vaccines introduce mRNA, not weakened viruses.  The incorrect matches test the candidateâs understanding of the immune system's cellular components and their specific roles in the immune response.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Application       Description
1.  Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) :   Used to treat sickle cell anemia

4.  Juno Mission                           :   Atlas V
5.  JUICE Mission                          :   Ariane 5

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 was indeed launched using the GSLV MKIII. Aditya-L1 utilized the PSLV C57 for its launch. The initial test flight for the Gaganyaan mission employed the LVM3 launch vehicle.  The JUICE mission successfully used the Ariane 5 rocket. However, the Juno mission was launched using an Atlas V rocket, not any of the listed Indian launch vehicles. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the Juno mission's launch vehicle pairing.  This question tests factual recall of specific space missions and their associated launch vehicles, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge in space exploration programs for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries characteristically utilize graphite as the anode material. Sodium-ion batteries commonly employ sodium metal oxides in their cathode structure. Sand batteries are indeed designed to store energy in the form of heat, leveraging the thermal properties of sand.  A significant safety concern with lithium-ion batteries is the use of a liquid and flammable electrolyte, posing fire risks.  Finally, a key challenge of Sodium-ion batteries compared to Lithium-ion is their lower energy density.  Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biofuel Type                       Production Method/Characteristic

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ethanol is primarily produced through fermentation processes, utilizing biological materials. Biodiesel is manufactured through transesterification, converting vegetable oils or animal fats into fatty acid methyl esters. Green hydrogen production relies on electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. Biodiesel is characterized by its non-toxic nature, unlike some other biofuels. The last pair, however, is a distractor.  While ethanol is often *compared* to other biofuels in terms of cost, the statement "Ethanol is less expensive than ethanol" is nonsensical.  Therefore, only the first four pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to Solar Phenomena, consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Feature                       Characteristic/Location

5.  White Phosphorus                   : Used in fertilizers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphene is indeed known for its exceptionally high surface area and finds applications in various technologies, including solar cells. Hybrid nanoparticles are accurately defined as combinations of at least two different types of nanoparticles. Tantalum is correctly characterized as a rare metal with a remarkably high melting point.  Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of Calcium-41 in radiometric dating, alongside more established isotopes. However, the final pair is incorrect. While white phosphorus has some industrial uses, its primary association is as an incendiary agent in military applications, not as a component in fertilizers.  Therefore, only the first four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect, either omitting a correctly matched pair or including the incorrectly matched pair.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Rocket Engine/Technology          Characteristic/Application

(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CE-20 cryogenic engine correctly uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) as propellants. The SCE-200 semi-cryogenic engine accurately uses LOX and RP-1 kerosene. The Vikas engine is a distractor; while it is a crucial engine in ISRO's arsenal, it's not the sole engine used in the LVM3. The SSLV (Small Satellite Launch Vehicle) is correctly a three-stage launch vehicle. The RLV-LEX (Reusable Launch Vehicle-Landing Experiment) is correctly known for its autonomous landing capabilities. The third pair is incorrect because while Vikas engines are part of the LVM3, the statement is not entirely accurate as the LVM3 also uses other stages and engines. Therefore, only the first, second, fourth and fifth pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect, either including an incorrectly matched pair or omitting a correctly matched one.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                     Key Feature

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Biodiesel is indeed produced through a chemical process called transesterification, where vegetable oils or animal fats are converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME).  Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources, differentiating it from "grey" or "blue" hydrogen produced from fossil fuels. Sodium-ion batteries, unlike lithium-ion batteries, use sodium ions as their charge carriers. Finally, sand batteries utilize the thermal properties of sand to store energy as heat, releasing it on demand for heating applications.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the accurate answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Lithium-ion batteries utilize graphite as the anode material, where lithium ions are stored during discharge.  Sodium-ion batteries generally have a lower cost compared to lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance and lower cost of sodium.  Lithium-ion batteries typically exhibit a higher energy density than sodium-ion batteries, allowing for longer usage times between charges.  Finally, the cathode in sodium-ion batteries frequently employs various sodium metal oxides.  Therefore, option (d), which includes all four correct matches, is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.

(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Breeder reactors are designed to produce more fissile material than they consume, a key characteristic distinguishing them from other reactor types. The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) specifically utilizes liquid sodium as its coolant. However, Thorium reactors do not directly use Uranium-233 as fuel; instead, thorium is a fertile material that is converted into U-233.  Furthermore, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are characterized by their smaller size and power output (up to 300 MW), not exceeding 1 GW like traditional reactors. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs 2 and/or 3.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Antimatter finds application in positron emission tomography (PET) scans for medical imaging. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) are specifically designed to provide power for long-duration deep space missions where solar power is insufficient. Ion thrusters are utilized for precise orientation and position control of satellites, offering high efficiency for station-keeping.  Finally, the Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE) is being developed for its potential to enable more efficient and powerful propulsion systems for deep space missions, including future Moon to Mars journeys. Therefore, option (d), which includes all four correct matches, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. An exoplanet is, by definition, a planet orbiting a star outside our solar system. Nuclear fusion is the process of combining light atomic nuclei, releasing significant energy. However, the Artemis Accords are a broader set of principles guiding international cooperation in space exploration, not limited to the Moon. SOFIA was a *stratospheric* observatory, an airborne telescope, not ground-based. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs 1 and/or 3.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) utilize Uranium-Plutonium Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) use natural uranium as fuel. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed for factory fabrication, reducing on-site construction time. However, while thorium reactors are considered safer, this is a comparative advantage and not a defining characteristic of *all* thorium reactors.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion or exclusion of the incorrectly matched pair 3.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

It assesses the ability to apply knowledge of astrophysics to observational techniques.


**1. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following pairs:**

   Technology/Technique                     Application
1. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology : Development of low-pungent mustard variety
2. Gene-drive Technology (GDT)         : Treatment of inherited genetic diseases
3. Somatic cell gene therapy              : Modification of germline cells (egg or sperm)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 1 only.  Indian researchers successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a low-pungent mustard variety, as explicitly stated in the provided text.  Gene-drive technology, while a form of genome editing, is not directly linked to treating inherited diseases in the given context; its applications are broader and potentially include controlling disease vectors.  The statement pairing somatic cell gene therapy with germline cell modification is incorrect. Somatic cell gene therapy targets non-reproductive cells, while germline gene therapy modifies reproductive cells, leading to heritable changes.  The text clearly distinguishes between these two types of gene therapy, highlighting that germline gene therapy is illegal in India. Therefore, only pair 1 accurately reflects the information provided.

3. Application Development Initiative      : Mitigating barriers to entry into AI programs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. The India AI Mission's "Compute Capacity" component focuses on providing the necessary resources for AI innovation, not specifically on LMM development. That task falls under the "Innovation Centre" component.  The "IndiaAI Datasets Platform" accurately aims to provide easy access to non-personal datasets, as described in the text. The "Application Development Initiative" focuses on implementing AI solutions for socio-economic transformation, not on addressing barriers to AI program entry (which is a function of FutureSkills). Therefore, only the second pair correctly links a component of the India AI Mission with its described function.


**3. With reference to the GenomeIndia Project, consider the following pairs:**

   Project/Initiative                        Characteristic

2. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)                : Involves removing the mother's nucleus and transferring it to a donor egg
3. Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) : Aims to prevent transmission of mitochondrial diseases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 only.  The description of Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are reversed in pairs 1 and 2. MST involves transferring the mother's nucleus to an enucleated donor egg, while PNT involves transferring pronuclei (both maternal and paternal) after fertilization.  Pair 3 correctly states the primary aim of MRT, which is to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases to offspring.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.

3. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)   :  Treated with a six-month, all-oral, three-drug regimen called BPaL

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) 1 and 2 only. Pair 1 correctly describes the BCG vaccine's efficacy against pulmonary TB but not extrapulmonary TB. Pair 2 accurately defines MDR-TB's resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin. However, pair 3 is incorrect. While BPaL is a treatment for XDR-TB, it's not explicitly mentioned as a six-month, all-oral, three-drug regimen in the provided text. The text mentions BPaL as containing pretomanid, bedaquiline, and linezolid, but doesn't specify the duration or administration method.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are definitively correct based on the provided information.

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Genome editing utilizes techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, which is closely related to gene drive technology, aiming to alter gene frequencies in populations.  Three-parent baby techniques involve mitochondrial replacement therapy to prevent mitochondrial diseases from being passed on from the mother. CAR-T cell therapy uses chimeric antigen receptors to target and destroy cancer cells. Gene silencing employs methods like RNA interference to suppress gene expression. Finally, mitochondrial replacement therapy uses techniques like maternal spindle transfer.  Options (a), (b), and (c)  incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to Li-ion batteries, consider the following pairs:**

   Component/Feature                       Description/Material
1. Cathode                                  :   Lithium manganese oxide
2. Electrolyte                               :   Ether
3.  Solid-state lithium battery              :   Uses liquid electrolyte
4.  Memory Effect                            :    Repeated partial charging/discharging cycles causing lower capacity
5.  Advantage of Li-ion battery             :    500 cycles or more


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lithium manganese oxide is indeed used in the cathode of some Li-ion batteries, particularly in electric vehicles. Ether is a class of organic compounds used as electrolytes in Li-ion batteries. The "memory effect" accurately describes the phenomenon of repeated partial charging/discharging leading to reduced battery capacity. Option (c) is incorrect because solid-state lithium batteries use solid, not liquid, electrolytes, and Li-ion batteries boast significantly more than 500 charge cycles. Option (d) repeats option (a). Option (b) excludes a correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology Mission/Concept          Description/Feature

(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing on the Moon. Aditya-L1 is a mission dedicated to studying the Sun. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), including its Indian counterpart, is designed to detect gravitational waves.  The JWST observes across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, not just visible light. The JUICE mission targets the moons of Jupiter, not Saturn. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to Nuclear Technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Reactor Type/Concept                       Characteristic/Feature
1. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)            :   Uses pressurized water for cooling
2.  Fourth-generation nuclear reactor       :   Uses helium for cooling
3.  Net Energy Gain (NEG) in nuclear fusion :   More energy input than output
4.  Fission Molybdenum-99                  :   Used in medical imaging
5.  Lithium-ion batteries                    :  Used in nuclear power plants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fourth-generation nuclear reactors utilize helium for cooling, unlike conventional reactors employing pressurized water. Fission of molybdenum-99 produces technetium-99m, a crucial isotope for medical imaging.  SMRs use various cooling methods, not exclusively pressurized water. Net energy gain implies more energy output than input, contradicting option 3.  Lithium-ion batteries are not directly used in nuclear power plants; their application is in energy storage systems.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include mismatched pairs.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease/Condition                         Associated Feature/Treatment

2.  Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)           :   Increased bacterial resistance to drugs
3.  Tuberculosis (TB)                        :   Caused by a virus
4.  Meningitis                               :   Inflammation of brain and spinal cord membranes
5.  Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS)  :   Characterized by low platelet count and blood clots


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) correctly describes the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.  Meningitis involves the inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.  TTS is indeed characterized by a low platelet count and the formation of blood clots.  Sickle cell disease is not caused by lactic acid accumulation; it is a genetic disorder. Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria, not a virus. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to Gene Editing and related concepts, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Technique                       Description/Associated Element
1.  CRISPR-Cas9                             :   Uses RNA interference
2.  Jumping Genes (Transposons)          :   Segments of DNA that cannot move
3.  Gene Silencing                          :   Prevents gene expression
4.  Exons                                   :   Non-coding sequences in DNA
5.  Introns                                  :   Coding sequences in DNA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gene silencing accurately describes the process of preventing gene expression.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool, but it does not directly utilize RNA interference (although RNA is involved). Jumping genes (transposons) are segments of DNA that *can* move within a genome. Exons are coding sequences, and introns are non-coding sequences.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of RNA                               Function/Characteristic
1.  Messenger RNA (mRNA)                   :   Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
2.  Transfer RNA (tRNA)                    :   Part of ribosomes
3.  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)                   :   Carries amino acids to ribosomes
4.  MicroRNA (miRNA)                       :   Involved in RNA splicing
5.  Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)              :   Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

mRNA carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis. rRNA is a structural component of ribosomes.  snRNA is involved in pre-mRNA splicing.  tRNA carries amino acids to ribosomes during translation, and miRNA is involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  The other options contain incorrectly matched pairs.



**8. With reference to Epigenetics, consider the following pairs:**

   Epigenetic Mechanism                     Description/Effect
1. DNA Methylation                          :   Addition of acetyl groups to DNA
2. Histone Modifications                   :   Alterations to DNA sequence
3.  Non-coding RNAs                         :   Regulate gene expression
4.  Methylated DNA                          :   Often involves cytosine bases
5.  Damaged DNA                             :   Always leads to gene silencing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Non-coding RNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. DNA methylation often involves the addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases.  DNA methylation does *not* involve acetyl groups; that's associated with histone modification. Histone modifications do not alter the DNA sequence itself. Damaged DNA can have various effects, not necessarily gene silencing. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nanotechnology Material/Concept         Property/Application
1.  Graphene                               :   Poor conductor of electricity
2.  Hybrid Nanoparticles                    :   Combine at least two different nanoparticles
3.  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)                :   Low surface area
4.  Tantalum                               :   Low melting point
5.  Supercritical carbon dioxide            :   Used in enhanced oil recovery


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Hybrid nanoparticles are indeed made by combining at least two different nanoparticles. Supercritical carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery techniques.  Graphene is an excellent conductor of electricity. CNTs possess a high surface area. Tantalum has a very high melting point. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. The other options contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**10. With reference to  Space Launch Vehicles, consider the following pairs:**

4.  Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)   :  Can launch satellites weighing up to 1000 kg
5.  Agnibaan SubOrbital Technological Demonstrator (SOrTeD) :  World's first 3D-printed rocket


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CE-20 cryogenic engine powers the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle.  The Agnibaan SOrTeD is indeed the world's first 3D-printed rocket.  POEM-2 utilizes the spent PS4 stage of the PSLV, not the CE-20. The SCE-200 uses liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene, not liquid hydrogen. The SSLV has a payload capacity of up to 500 kg, not 1000 kg.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are both techniques used in Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT), accurately described in the pairs.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technology that uses guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to specific DNA sequences, making pair 3 correct.  Pair 4 is incorrect; ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) are a gene-editing technology, not related to non-coding RNA regulation.  Non-coding RNAs are involved in epigenetic mechanisms, but ZFNs directly manipulate DNA. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) incorrectly includes pair 4. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, and option (c) is the only one that accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**2. With reference to Gene Editing Techniques, consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of gene-editing technologies and their associated enzymes. Pair 1 is partially correct; CRISPR-Cas9 uses Cas9, but some advanced CRISPR systems may utilize Reverse Transcriptase for specific gene editing applications.  Pair 2 is incorrect; Cas9 is associated with CRISPR-Cas9, not ZFNs. Pair 3 is incorrect; TALENs do not directly utilize restriction enzymes.  While restriction enzymes are used in other genetic engineering techniques, they are not central to the TALEN mechanism.  Therefore, only pair 1 has a partially correct association, making option (a) the most appropriate answer, acknowledging the nuances of CRISPR technology. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the key enzymes involved in these gene editing techniques.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 only.  Biogas is produced through anaerobic digestion, a process where microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen.  Option 1 is incorrect because bioethanol is primarily produced through fermentation, not transesterification. Transesterification is the process used to create biodiesel from oils and fats. Option 2 is incorrect as biodiesel is produced via transesterification, not fermentation.  Option 4 is incorrect because while pyrolysis can be used in biofuel production (to create bio-oil, a precursor to other biofuels), it's not the primary method for methanol production. Methanol is typically synthesized from other chemical processes, often involving the use of natural gas or other carbon sources.  The question tests factual recall of biofuel production methods and aims to distinguish between different processes involved in creating various biofuels.

4. Fourth Generation            Genetically engineered crops


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 only. Second-generation biofuels utilize non-food biomass such as agricultural residues, and lignocellulosic biomass is a key example.  Option 1 is incorrect; first-generation biofuels are primarily derived from food crops like corn and sugarcane. Option 2 is incorrect; second-generation biofuels use non-food sources, not food crops. Option 4 is incorrect because fourth-generation biofuels involve genetically engineered organisms, but it's not the exclusive feedstock.  The question tests knowledge of the different generations of biofuels and their associated feedstocks, requiring a nuanced understanding of biofuel production.


**5. With reference to gene silencing, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Gene Silencing         Mechanism
1. RNA interference (RNAi)       Uses Dicer enzyme to cleave double-stranded RNA
2. Transcriptional gene silencing   Involves DNA methylation
3. Post-transcriptional gene silencing   Inhibits mRNA translation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 1, 2, and 3. RNA interference (RNAi) utilizes the Dicer enzyme to process double-stranded RNA into smaller interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which then silence gene expression. Transcriptional gene silencing can involve DNA methylation, which alters chromatin structure and prevents transcription. Post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms can inhibit mRNA translation, preventing protein synthesis. All three pairs accurately describe aspects of gene silencing. The question tests understanding of the various mechanisms involved in gene silencing, requiring knowledge of molecular biology and gene regulation. The inclusion of all correct pairs makes it a challenging question.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Key Function/Initiative
1.  World Meteorological Organization (WMO)   :   Global Methane Pledge
2.  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) :  Clean Air Flagship
3.  Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) :  Greenwashing Guidelines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) is primarily focused on weather, climate, and related geophysical events. While it contributes to climate action through data and reports, the Global Methane Pledge is a collaborative initiative involving numerous governments and organizations, not solely led by the WMO.  The UNEP, as a leading UN agency on environmental issues, plays a central role in the Clean Air Flagship, coordinating international efforts to reduce short-lived climate pollutants. The CCPA in India is responsible for regulating consumer-related issues, and has indeed issued draft guidelines on Greenwashing to curb misleading environmental claims in advertising. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 incorrectly associates the WMO as the sole driving force behind the Global Methane Pledge.


**2. With reference to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), consider the following pairs:**

   City                                       Achievement
1.  Varanasi                                   Significant reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 levels
2.  Agra                                        Exceeded NAAQS for 5 consecutive years
3.  Jodhpur                                    No significant improvement in PM10 levels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The NCAP aims to improve air quality in several Indian cities.  Varanasi is explicitly mentioned in the provided text as achieving significant reductions in both PM2.5 and PM10.  While Agra is mentioned as a city under the NCAP, the text does not state it exceeded NAAQS for five consecutive years; this is a potential distractor playing on the knowledge that many cities under NCAP face this issue. Similarly, Jodhpur's air quality is mentioned as improved, contrasting with the statement in option 3. Therefore, only pair 1 accurately reflects the information provided about NCAP achievements. Options b, c, and d include incorrect information about Agra and Jodhpur, making them incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment Feature                         Impact
1.  Central government prescribes SPCB chairman nomination:    Increased Central Government control over SPCBs
2.  Decriminalization of violations:          Reduced penalties for water pollution offenses
3.  Penalty for altering monitoring devices:    Increased fines for tampering with water meters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendment significantly alters the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The amendment shifts the power to nominate the chairman of State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) from state governments to the central government, thus increasing central control (pair 1). The act replaces imprisonment for several violations with monetary penalties, but these penalties are substantial (â¹10,000 to â¹15 lakh), contradicting the claim of reduced penalties in pair 2.  The amendment introduces significant penalties for tampering with monitoring devices, accurately reflecting pair 3.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 correctly represent the Act's changes. Pair 2 presents a misleading interpretation of the decriminalization aspect; the penalties are not reduced but changed from imprisonment to financial penalties.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Rules                                   Key Provision/Feature
1.  Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024 :   Prohibition of all single-use plastics

mRNA vaccines are typically administered via direct injection into the body, usually intramuscularly.  The lipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines act as a delivery vehicle, protecting the fragile mRNA molecule from degradation and facilitating its uptake into cells, but they are not the primary *method* of delivery.  The delivery method is the injection itself.  DNA vaccines, on the other hand, often require more sophisticated delivery systems like electroporation to enhance their uptake by cells. Electroporation creates temporary pores in cell membranes, allowing the DNA to enter. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect because conventional vaccines utilise methods like direct injection, but not encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles as the primary delivery method.  The use of lipid nanoparticles is a feature of mRNA vaccines, not conventional vaccines generally.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune Response Type              Mechanism
1. Humoral Immunity                  :   Mediated by T cells
2. Cellular Immunity                 :   Mediated by macromolecules in extracellular fluids
3. Immunological Memory              :   Ability to respond rapidly and effectively to previous pathogens

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies (immunoglobulins) produced by B cells, which are found in body fluids.  Cellular immunity, conversely, is mediated by T cells, which directly attack infected cells.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are mismatched. Immunological memory, however, is the ability of the immune system to mount a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposure to a previously encountered antigen, which accurately describes pair 3. This memory is a crucial aspect of adaptive immunity and is achieved through the presence of memory B and T cells.  The other options incorrectly link humoral and cellular immunity to the wrong mechanisms, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the fundamental aspects of the immune system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Immunity                   Acquisition Method
1. Innate Immunity                    :   Developed through exposure to diseases or vaccines
2. Adaptive Immunity                 :   Present from birth
3. Passive Immunity                   :   Acquired through transfer of antibodies or activated T-cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Innate immunity is the non-specific, immediate defense mechanism present from birth.  Adaptive immunity, in contrast, develops over time after exposure to antigens through infection or vaccination.  Thus, pairs 1 and 2 are reversed. Passive immunity, however, is correctly matched with its acquisition method: the transfer of pre-formed antibodies or activated T cells from an immune host, such as from mother to fetus or via antibody injections.  This provides immediate but temporary protection.  Understanding the distinct characteristics and acquisition methods of these immunity types is crucial for comprehending the body's defense mechanisms.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cell Type                          Function
1.  B Cells                            :   Kill virally infected cells and tumor cells
2.  Macrophages                       :   Produce antibodies and mediate humoral immunity
3.  Natural Killer (NK) Cells         :   Phagocytose pathogens and present antigens to T cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

B cells are responsible for antibody production and humoral immunity, accurately reflecting pair 2.  However, natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that directly kill infected or cancerous cells, not B cells.  Macrophages are phagocytic cells that engulf pathogens and present antigens to T cells, not B cells.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.  This question tests the understanding of the roles of different immune cells in the immune response, distinguishing between antibody-mediated (humoral) and cell-mediated immunity.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune Disorder                     Description
1. Immunodeficiency                   :   Hypersensitive reaction to certain antigens
2. Autoimmunity                       :   Immune response against the body's own cells
3. Allergy                             :   Compromised ability to fight infectious disease

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Autoimmunity is correctly defined as an immune response directed against the body's own tissues and cells, which is pair 2.  Immunodeficiency, on the other hand, is a state where the immune system is weakened, making individuals more susceptible to infections.  Allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction to typically harmless environmental antigens.  Thus pairs 1 and 3 are mismatched.  This question assesses the understanding of different immune disorders, highlighting the distinction between self-directed immune responses (autoimmunity), deficient immune responses (immunodeficiency), and exaggerated immune responses (allergy).


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Influenza Virus              Characteristic
1.  Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) :   Causes severe disease and high mortality in poultry
2.  Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) :   Causes mild disease or no signs of disease in chickens
3.  Influenza A viruses                 :   Divided into subtypes based on hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Influenza A viruses are indeed classified into subtypes based on the surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), making pair 3 correct.  However, LPAI viruses are characterized by causing mild or no disease in poultry, while HPAI viruses cause severe disease and high mortality.  Pairs 1 and 2 are therefore reversed.  Understanding the different pathogenicity levels of avian influenza viruses and their classification is essential for effective disease surveillance and control.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technique Used in MRT             Description
1. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) :   Pronuclei from both mother's and donor's fertilized eggs are used
2. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)       :   Nucleus from mother's egg is transferred to an enucleated donor egg
3. Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy: Involves replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT) accurately encompasses the core concept of replacing defective mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.  However, MST involves transferring the mother's nucleus to a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed.  PNT utilizes pronuclei from both the mother's and donor's fertilized eggs.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect descriptions of the named techniques.  The question tests the knowledge of assisted reproductive technologies and the specific steps involved in MRT and its variations.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Silencing Technique          Mechanism
1. CRISPR-Cas9                       :   Uses small RNA molecules to target and degrade mRNA
2. RNA Interference (RNAi)          :   Can edit genes and silence them, preventing expression
3. Gene Silencing                     : Involves preventing gene expression into a protein


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The general definition of gene silencing â preventing gene expression into a protein â is accurately represented in pair 3.  However, CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing tool that can precisely target and modify DNA sequences, often resulting in gene silencing, but its mechanism is not solely based on RNA interference.  RNA interference (RNAi) utilizes small RNA molecules (siRNA or miRNA) to target and degrade mRNA molecules, preventing their translation into proteins.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are mismatched. The question assesses the understanding of gene silencing techniques and their mechanisms of action.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of RNA                         Function

2.  siRNA                               :   Involved in splicing of pre-mRNA
3.  snRNA                               :   Carries genetic code from DNA to ribosomes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

mRNA (messenger RNA) correctly carries the genetic code from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis, which is pair 3.  However, siRNA (small interfering RNA) is involved in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism of gene silencing, not mRNA.  snRNA (small nuclear RNA) participates in the splicing of pre-mRNA, removing introns to produce mature mRNA.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are mismatched.  This question tests the understanding of different types of RNA and their specific functions in gene expression and regulation.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  Genomic DNA                         :   The primary genetic material of an organism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Circular DNA is indeed found in many bacteria, plasmids, mitochondria, and chloroplasts.  However, some viruses also possess ssDNA genomes.  Genomic DNA is the organism's primary genetic material.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.  This question assesses the knowledge of different types of DNA, their structures, and their locations within cells and organisms.  The question highlights the diverse forms DNA can take and their functional significance.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Graphene:** This statement is incorrect. Graphene is known for its exceptional thermal and electrical conductivity, far exceeding that of most other materials.

2. **Diamond:** This statement is incorrect.  Diamond is an excellent insulator and a poor conductor of electricity, unlike graphite which is a good conductor.

3. **Lab-grown diamond:** This is incorrect. Lab-grown diamonds are created using both High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) methods.

4. **Tantalum:** This statement is incorrect. Tantalum is renowned for its extremely high corrosion resistance, even at temperatures below 150Â°C.  This is a key reason for its use in various applications.

5. **Vanadium:** This statement is correct. Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) utilize vanadium redox reactions for efficient and reliable energy storage, particularly from renewable sources.


Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of material properties and applications.  The distractors are designed to be plausible based on superficial knowledge or common misconceptions.


**2. With reference to radiometric dating, consider the following pairs:**

   Isotope                      Half-life (years)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The question assesses factual recall of isotope half-lives and their applications in radiometric dating.

1. **Carbon-14:** The half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5,700 years, not 99,400 years. This is a common misconception, designed as a distractor.

2. **Calcium-41:**  The half-life of Calcium-41 is 99,400 years, not 5,700 years.  This is another deliberate error to mislead.

3. **Potassium-40/Argon-40:** This pair is correctly matched. The Potassium-40/Argon-40 dating method is indeed used for dating much older materials, exceeding the limitations of Carbon-14 dating.


Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. The incorrect options highlight common errors in understanding radiometric dating techniques and isotope half-lives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests the understanding of various technologies and their applications.

1. **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** RPA is not limited to medical robots; it's a broader technology used for automating repetitive tasks across various sectors.

2. **3D Printing:** This is correctly matched. 3D printing's ability to create complex shapes and geometries is a key advantage.

3. **Genome Editing (GE):**  Genome editing aims to *reduce* glucosinolates in mustard, not increase them, as that would increase pungency.

4. **Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA):** ATTA is used for radiometric dating,  but is specifically useful for dating organic materials, not non-living things like rocks.  Carbon-14 is a better choice.

5. **Hybrid Nanoparticles:**  Hybrid nanoparticles are used for both cancer detection (using sound waves â photoacoustic properties) and treatment (using heat â photothermal properties).


Only pair 2 is correctly matched, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the technologies and their applications. The incorrect options offer plausible but inaccurate pairings, challenging the candidate's knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Element                      Use/Property
1. Caesium                     :   Used as a timekeeper in atomic clocks
2. Xenon                       :   Found in photographer's flashguns
3. White Phosphorus             :   Used only in fertilizers
4. Tantalum                     :   Substitutes Platinum due to its high melting point and lower cost
5. Supercritical Carbon Dioxide :   Used to flush out oil from depleting oil and gas reservoirs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) All


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only


**Explanation:**

This question tests factual knowledge about the uses and properties of different elements and substances.

1. **Caesium:** This is correctly matched. Caesium is the standard element used in atomic clocks due to its precise atomic resonance frequency.

2. **Xenon:** This is correctly matched. Xenon's ability to emit bright light when electrically excited makes it suitable for flashguns.

3. **White Phosphorus:** This is incorrect. While white phosphorus has applications in fertilizers, it's also used in military incendiary devices.  The statement is too restrictive.

4. **Tantalum:**  This is correctly matched. Tantalum's high melting point and corrosion resistance make it a suitable substitute for platinum in some applications, though it's not a direct replacement in all cases.

5. **Supercritical Carbon Dioxide:** This is correctly matched. Research indicates its potential in enhanced oil recovery and carbon dioxide sequestration.


Pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  The incorrect option 3 serves as a strong distractor by employing a partially true statement, testing the candidate's ability to identify incomplete or overly specific information.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to evaluate the accuracy of statements.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Component             Description
1. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) : Uses enriched uranium as fuel
2. Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)           : Uses liquid sodium as coolant
3. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)           : Typically over 1 GW per unit

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), a cornerstone of India's three-stage nuclear power program, utilize *natural* uranium as fuel, not enriched uranium.  This is a key distinction, as natural uranium has a lower concentration of the fissile isotope U-235 compared to enriched uranium.  Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) indeed employ liquid sodium as a coolant due to its excellent heat transfer properties and non-moderating nature, crucial for the fast neutron spectrum required for breeding fissile material. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are designed to be significantly smaller in power output than traditional nuclear reactors, which typically exceed 1 GW.  Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.  The other options are incorrect because they include the false statements about PHWRs and SMRs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Process                       Characteristic
1. Nuclear Fusion                         : Splits heavy atomic nuclei
2. Nuclear Fission                        : Combines light atomic nuclei
3. Uranium Enrichment                  : Increases percentage of U-238

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 accurately describes nuclear fission.  Nuclear fusion is the process of combining light atomic nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen) to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.  Nuclear fission, conversely, involves the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus (like uranium or plutonium) into two lighter nuclei, also releasing energy. Uranium enrichment is a process that increases the percentage of the *fissile* isotope U-235, not U-238, in uranium ore. U-235 is the isotope that undergoes fission in nuclear reactors.  Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect.  Statement 1 is also incorrect because it attributes the characteristics of fission to fusion. The other options are incorrect because they include these false statements.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Technology                    Description
1. ITER                                 : Inertial confinement fusion reactor
2. JT-60SA                              : Magnetic confinement fusion reactor
3.  National Ignition Facility (NIF)    :  Located in France

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched.  The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a large-scale magnetic confinement fusion device, not an inertial confinement reactor.  The JT-60SA, a major experimental nuclear fusion reactor, uses magnetic confinement to contain and heat plasma. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is an inertial confinement fusion facility located in the United States, not France.  ITER is located in France.  The other options are incorrect because they contain false pairings of the technologies and their descriptions or locations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Nuclear Power Plant              Feature
1. Kakrapar Nuclear Power Plant (KAPP 3) : First 700 MWe indigenous reactor
2. Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR): Located in Gujarat
3.  Kalpakkam Nuclear Power Plant       : Uses thorium as primary fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  KAPP 3 is indeed the largest indigenous 700 MWe nuclear power reactor built by NPCIL. The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is located in Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu, not Gujarat. While Kalpakkam houses various nuclear facilities, including the PFBR, it doesn't primarily use thorium as its fuel. Thorium reactors are still under development in India's three-stage nuclear program. The other options include these incorrect pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material                                   Property
1.  Silicon                                  : Insulator
2.  Germanium                               : Semiconductor
3.  Quartz                                   : Conductor

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Silicon and germanium are both well-known semiconductors, meaning their electrical conductivity lies between that of a conductor and an insulator.  However, statement 1 is incorrect because silicon is a semiconductor, not an insulator.  Quartz, while containing silicon, is an insulator, not a conductor.  Therefore, statement 3 is also incorrect. Option (b) is the only option that correctly identifies the semiconductor property of germanium.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                           Primary Constituent
1. Biogas                                  : Methane and carbon dioxide
2. Natural Gas                              : Methane
3. Producer Gas                             : Carbon monoxide and hydrogen

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Biogas is primarily composed of methane and carbon dioxide, while natural gas consists mainly of methane.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Producer gas, a product of coal gasification, is mainly composed of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, not hydrogen. Therefore, only options (a) and (b) are possible, and since statement 2 is correct, (b) is the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                                 Characteristic
1. Petrol                                   : Higher energy density by weight than hydrogen
2. Diesel                                   : Lower NOx emissions than petrol
3. Hydrogen                                 : Highest energy density by volume


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. Petrol has a higher energy density by weight compared to hydrogen.  However, statement 2 is incorrect because diesel engines generally produce *higher* NOx emissions than petrol engines due to higher combustion temperatures and pressures. Statement 3 is incorrect because hydrogen has a very *low* volumetric energy density, making storage and transportation challenging.  Thus, only option (a) accurately reflects the given information.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Battery                           Characteristic
1. Lithium-ion Battery                     : Uses sodium ions for energy storage
2. Sodium-ion Battery                     : Lower energy density than lithium-ion
3. Sand Battery                            :  Long-duration energy storage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Sodium-ion batteries generally have a lower energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries.  Sand batteries are known for their long-duration energy storage capabilities.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; lithium-ion batteries utilize lithium ions, not sodium ions, for energy storage.  Therefore, option (c) is the only one that correctly reflects the characteristics of sodium-ion and sand batteries.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                             Objective
1. Chandrayaan-3                           :  Solar observation
2. Aditya-L1                               : Lunar exploration
3. Gaganyaan Mission                        : Human spaceflight

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. The Gaganyaan mission aims to send humans into space.  Chandrayaan-3 is a lunar mission, not a solar observation mission. Aditya-L1 is designed for solar observation, not lunar exploration.  Therefore, option (b) accurately reflects the primary objectives of the Gaganyaan mission.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Phenomenon                         Description
1. Solar Flare                               : Continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun
2. Solar Wind                               : Intense, localized emission of electromagnetic radiation
3. Gravitational Waves                       :  Disturbances in spacetime caused by accelerating masses

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. Gravitational waves are indeed disturbances in spacetime caused by accelerating massive objects.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; a solar flare is a sudden burst of energy from the Sun, while a solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles. Statement 2 incorrectly describes solar flares as a continuous phenomenon. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct, making option (b) the right answer.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Material                     Property
1. Graphene                  :   Poor conductor of heat and electricity
2. Tantalum                   :   Low melting point
3. White Phosphorus           :   Does not spontaneously catch fire in air
4. Supercritical Carbon Dioxide:   Not a fluid state of carbon dioxide
5. Calcium-41                 :   Half-life of 5,700 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  Let's examine each one:

1. **Graphene:**  The passage explicitly states that graphene is a "good conductor of heat and electricity," directly contradicting the statement in the question.

2. **Tantalum:** The text describes tantalum as possessing an "extremely high melting point," the opposite of what's presented in the pair.

3. **White Phosphorus:** The passage clearly indicates that white phosphorus "spontaneously catches fire in air,"  making the paired statement false.

4. **Supercritical Carbon Dioxide:** The definition provided in the text states that supercritical carbon dioxide is indeed a "fluid state of carbon dioxide," held at or above its critical temperature and pressure.  The paired statement is therefore incorrect.

5. **Calcium-41:** The passage correctly identifies the half-life of Calcium-41 as 99,400 years, not 5,700 years (which is the half-life of Carbon-14).


Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. The question effectively tests factual recall regarding the properties of various materials and isotopes.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible, based on potential confusion or incomplete knowledge of these materials.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                     Application
1.  Hybrid Nanoparticles          :  Treatment of bacterial infections
2.  Robotic Process Automation   :  Performing complex surgical procedures
3.  MRI Technology                :  Producing images of internal body structures using ionizing radiation
4.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA):  Dating objects younger than 50,000 years
5.  Gene Drive Technology        :  Introducing random genetic changes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Hybrid Nanoparticles:** The passage describes the use of hybrid nanoparticles in cancer treatment, using heat and sound waves for diagnosis and therapy. This aligns with the statement given in the question.

2. **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):**  RPA is explicitly described as automating "repetitive office tasks," not complex surgical procedures. Surgical robots are a distinct field of robotics.

3. **MRI Technology:** The text states that MRI uses "no ionizing radiation," unlike X-rays. The paired statement is therefore false.

4. **Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA):** The passage mentions ATTA's use in radiometric dating, addressing the limitation of Carbon-14 dating for objects older than 50,000 years.  This makes the pair correct.

5. **Gene Drive Technology:** The text explains that gene drive aims to promote the inheritance of a *specific* genetic trait, not to introduce random changes. Random genetic changes are associated with other methods like mutagenesis.


Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests the understanding of the applications of different technologies, requiring both factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts. The distractors are carefully designed to include plausible but ultimately incorrect uses of the technologies.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                         Causative Agent/Factor
1. Blue Baby Syndrome           :   Sulphite contamination
2. Meningitis                     :   Primarily transmitted through air
3. Avian Influenza               :   Caused by influenza type B viruses
4. TTS (Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome):  Primarily caused by the MMR vaccine
5. Sickle Cell Disease            :   Genetic disorder


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 5 only

**Explanation:**

The question assesses factual recall about various diseases and their causes. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Blue Baby Syndrome:** The passage correctly attributes blue baby syndrome to nitrate (NO3-) contamination, not sulphite.

2. **Meningitis:** While meningitis can have various causes (bacterial, viral, fungal), the passage specifically mentions that it is "mostly transmitted from person to person," not primarily through the air.

3. **Avian Influenza:** The passage clearly states that avian influenza is caused by "avian influenza (flu) Type A viruses," not type B.

4. **TTS:**  The passage links TTS to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (Covishield), not the MMR vaccine.

5. **Sickle Cell Disease:** The passage accurately describes sickle cell disease as a "genetic disorder."


Only pair 5 is correctly matched. The other options are designed to be plausible distractors, testing the examinee's knowledge of disease transmission and etiology. This question highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding medical conditions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Chemical Compound            Application/Use
1. Ethylene                       :  Preservation of fruits
2. Methanol                      :  Component in fertilisers
3. Liquid Nitrogen                :  Artificial ripening of fruits
4. White Phosphorus              :  Component in cleaning compounds
5. Supercritical Carbon Dioxide : Enhanced oil recovery


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests the knowledge of various chemical compounds and their applications.

1. **Ethylene:** While ethylene is used for artificial ripening, the passage states that its direct contact with fruits is prohibited, implying it's not for fruit preservation.

2. **Methanol:** The passage lists methanol's applications in synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes, not fertilizers.

3. **Liquid Nitrogen:** Liquid nitrogen is used for freezing and transporting food, not artificial ripening.

4. **White Phosphorus:** The passage mentions white phosphorus's use as a component in fertilizers and cleaning compounds, making this pair correct.

5. **Supercritical Carbon Dioxide:** The passage correctly describes its application in enhanced oil recovery, making this pair correct.

Only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the student's ability to differentiate between similar applications of different compounds.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of chemical uses in various industries.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Technology             Description
1.  Totipotency                   :   The ability of a cell to differentiate into only certain cell types
2.  Glycemic Index (GI)           :   Measures how slowly a carbohydrate raises blood sugar
3.  Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):  Producers are not responsible for end-of-life management of their products
4.  Meissner Effect                :  Expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor above its critical temperature
5.  Retrotransposons              :   Genetic elements that do not replicate


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The question tests understanding of various scientific concepts.

1. **Totipotency:** The definition provided in the text is the ability of a cell to divide and differentiate into *any* type of specialized cell, opposite to the given statement.

2. **Glycemic Index (GI):**  The passage defines GI as measuring how *quickly* a carbohydrate raises blood sugar, not slowly.

3. **Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):** The description in the provided text directly contradicts the provided statement. EPR explicitly holds producers responsible for end-of-life management.

4. **Meissner Effect:** The passage states that the Meissner effect occurs when a superconductor is cooled *below* its critical temperature (Tc), not above.

5. **Retrotransposons:** The passage describes retrotransposons as genetic elements that *do* replicate through reverse transcription.


Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, based on potential misunderstandings or incomplete knowledge of the concepts.  The question emphasizes the necessity of precise definitions and understanding in science.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Editing Technology              Description
1.  ZFN                                  :   Uses transcription activator-like effector nucleases
2.  TALEN                               :   Employs zinc finger nucleases
3.  CRISPR-Cas9                         :   Utilizes a guide RNA and Cas9 enzyme for targeted DNA cleavage

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair, CRISPR-Cas9, is correctly matched. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technology that uses a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific location in the genome, where it makes a double-strand break.  The cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms then repair the break, often introducing a change in the DNA sequence. ZFN (Zinc Finger Nuclease) and TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease) are other gene-editing technologies, but their mechanisms differ from the description given in pair 1 and 2. ZFN uses zinc finger proteins to target specific DNA sequences, while TALEN uses transcription activator-like effector proteins.  These proteins are different from the components described in the incorrect pairs. Therefore, only the description of CRISPR-Cas9 accurately reflects its mechanism.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**2. With reference to types of RNA, consider the following pairs:**

   RNA Type                        Function
1.  mRNA                               :   Guides chemical modifications of other non-coding RNAs
2.  snoRNA                             :   Involved in splicing of pre-mRNA
3.  snRNA                              :   Carries amino acids to ribosomes during translation
4.  tRNA                               :   Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only the fourth pair (tRNA: Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation) is partially correct. tRNA (transfer RNA) molecules are crucial for protein synthesis; they carry specific amino acids to the ribosomes based on the codons present in the mRNA. However, their primary function is not post-transcriptional gene regulation.  Post-transcriptional gene regulation is primarily carried out by other types of non-coding RNA, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).  The other pairs are incorrect. mRNA's primary function is to carry genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes for protein synthesis, not to modify other non-coding RNAs. That function belongs to snoRNAs (small nucleolar RNAs). snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs) are involved in splicing of pre-mRNA, not in carrying amino acids. Thus, only option (d) is partially correct, focusing on the role of tRNA in protein synthesis.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune System Component            Description
1.  Antibodies                           :   Cells that kill virally infected cells
2.  Natural Killer (NK) Cells            :   Proteins produced by B cells that neutralize pathogens
3.  Macrophages                         :   Cells that phagocytose pathogens and present antigens to T cells
4.  Cytokines                            :   Signaling molecules mediating and regulating immunity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Macrophages are indeed phagocytic cells that engulf pathogens and present antigens to T cells, initiating adaptive immune responses.  Cytokines are signaling molecules crucial for communication and regulation within the immune system, controlling inflammation and other immune processes. Pair 1 is incorrect; antibodies are proteins produced by B cells, not cells themselves.  Pair 2 is also incorrect; natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that directly kill infected or cancerous cells, not proteins.  Therefore, only options 3 and 4 accurately describe the functions of the given immune system components.


**4. With reference to Gene Therapy, consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Therapy Type                   Characteristic
1.  Germline gene therapy             :   Modifications are restricted to the patient and not inherited
2.  Somatic cell gene therapy         :   Therapeutic genes are transferred to germline cells (egg or sperm)
3.  Targeted gene therapy             :   Uses techniques like ZFN, TALEN, or CRISPR-Cas9

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Germline gene therapy involves modifying germline cells (egg or sperm), resulting in heritable changes passed to offspring. However,  the description in pair 1 is incorrect because it states that modifications are not inherited, which is the opposite of germline gene therapy.  Somatic cell gene therapy targets somatic cells (non-germline cells), and the modifications are confined to the treated individual, not passed on.  Targeted gene therapy, as described in pair 3, utilizes precise gene-editing technologies like ZFN, TALEN, or CRISPR-Cas9 to modify specific DNA sequences.  Option (d) correctly identifies the correctly matched pairs, while other options include at least one mismatched pair.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, demanding precise knowledge and avoiding ambiguity.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and an analysis of why the other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immune System Component             Function/Description
1. Antibodies (Immunoglobulins)       :   Cells that kill virally infected cells and tumor cells
2. Antigens                               :   Substances that provoke an immune response
3. B Cells (B Lymphocytes)             :   Proteins produced by B cells that neutralize pathogens
4. T Cells (T Lymphocytes)              :   Cells that mediate cellular immunity
5. Natural Killer (NK) Cells            :   Cells that produce antibodies and mediate humoral immunity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the functions of the immune system components. Antigens are indeed substances that trigger an immune response, and T cells are central to cellular immunity.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are proteins produced by B cells, not cells that directly kill infected cells. That function belongs to Natural Killer (NK) cells.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While B cells are involved in humoral immunity (antibody-mediated immunity), the description "proteins produced by B cells that neutralize pathogens" is more accurately attributed to the antibodies themselves. B cells *produce* the antibodies.

Pair 5 is incorrect for the same reason as Pair 1. Natural Killer cells are responsible for directly killing infected or cancerous cells, not producing antibodies.


**2. With reference to mRNA Vaccines, consider the following pairs:**

   Component/Process                     Description
1. mRNA construct                         :   A co-formulation of RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Chikungunya is indeed spread primarily by Aedes mosquitoes.  The Avian Influenza A (H9N2) virus is a subtype of influenza A virus that can affect both birds and humans. The Nipah Virus, a zoonotic virus, is transmitted from fruit bats.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The description "causes severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry" is characteristic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, not Zika virus. Zika virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and can cause microcephaly in infants.

Pair 4 is incorrect. Lumpy skin disease is a viral disease affecting cattle, not a blood-clotting disorder.

Pair 5 is incorrect.  cTTP is a rare blood-clotting disorder; it is not related to Chikungunya.


**4. With reference to Genome Editing, consider the following pairs:**

  Technique                                  Description/Application

(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lab-grown diamonds can be produced using both High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) methods.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Perovskite materials are used in solar cells and LEDs, but their production doesn't exclusively involve either HPHT or CVD.  The synthesis methods for perovskites are diverse and depend on the specific material composition and desired properties.  Therefore, pairs 3 and 4 are incorrectly matched as they imply an exclusive relationship between the material and a single production method. Option (b) accurately reflects that only the first two pairs are correctly matched.

(d) 1 and 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mercury and Lead are examples of materials exhibiting superconductivity (zero resistance below a critical temperature, Tc).  The Meissner effect, the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor, is a characteristic property of superconductors.  Room temperature superconductivity is a goal, not yet achieved at temperatures above 0Â°C. Cooper pairs are responsible for superconductivity and form at low temperatures, not high. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills, incorporating plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cell Type                      Function
1.  Cytotoxic T cells             :   Produce antibodies
2.  Helper T cells                :   Activate B cells and cytotoxic T cells
3.  Macrophages                 :   Kill virally infected cells
4.  Natural Killer (NK) cells    :   Phagocytose pathogens and present antigens to T cells
5.  B Cells                       :   Mediate humoral immunity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Helper T cells (Th) indeed assist in the activation of B cells and cytotoxic T cells, a crucial aspect of cellular immunity.  B cells are the key players in humoral immunity, producing antibodies to neutralize pathogens.  The other options present incorrect pairings. Cytotoxic T cells directly kill infected cells, not produce antibodies (option 1 is incorrect).  Macrophages are phagocytic cells that engulf pathogens and present antigens; they don't kill virally infected cells in the primary way NK cells do (options 3 and 4 are incorrect). Natural Killer cells are part of the innate immune system and directly kill infected or cancerous cells without prior sensitization.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 accurately reflect the functions of the respective cell types.


**2. With reference to mRNA vaccines, consider the following pairs:**

   Vaccine Component/Process         Description
1.  Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs)       :   Directly introduce mRNA into the cell nucleus
2.  mRNA Construct                   :   Engineered plasmid DNA used for in vitro transcription
3.  Reverse Transcriptase             :   Enzyme that synthesizes RNA from DNA template
4.  RNA Polymerase                   :   Enzyme that synthesizes RNA from DNA template
5. Spike protein                      :   Protein found on the coronavirus outer membrane


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The mRNA construct in mRNA vaccines is indeed generated from an engineered plasmid DNA using RNA polymerase.  RNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for this transcription process. The spike protein is a key antigen on the coronavirus surface, targeted by these vaccines.  Option (a) is incorrect because LNPs encapsulate the mRNA to protect it and facilitate uptake by cells, not directly deliver it to the nucleus.  Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (c) is incorrect as reverse transcriptase is not involved in mRNA vaccine production; it's used in retroviruses, not in the creation of mRNA for this type of vaccine. Thus, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are accurately matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Immunity Type                    Characteristic
1.  Innate Immunity                 :   Develops over time through exposure to diseases
2.  Adaptive Immunity               :   First line of defense against pathogens
3.  Passive Immunity                :   Immunity acquired through transfer of antibodies
4.  Active Immunity                  :   Immune response to antigen exposure
5.  Artificial Immunity              :   Immunity gained through natural processes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because passive immunity is indeed acquired through the transfer of antibodies, and active immunity develops in response to antigen exposure (infection or vaccination).  The other options are incorrect. Innate immunity is the immediate, non-specific defense, not the acquired one that develops over time (option 1 is incorrect). Adaptive immunity is the specific, long-lasting response, not the first line of defense (option 2 is incorrect). Artificial immunity is obtained through medical procedures like vaccination, not through natural processes (option 5 is incorrect).  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 represent accurate descriptions of the immunity types.


**4. With reference to Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT), consider the following pairs:**

   Technique                         Step Involved
1.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) :   Pronuclei from both mother's and donor's fertilized eggs are transferred.
2.  Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)       :   Mother's nucleus is transferred to a donor egg.
3.  MST                               :   Reconstructed egg contains mother's nuclear DNA and donor's healthy mitochondria.
4.  PNT                               :   Mother's egg and donor egg are both fertilized with father's sperm.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) involves transferring the mother's nucleus (containing most of the genetic material) to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria.  The resulting egg contains the mother's nuclear DNA and the donor's healthy mitochondria. Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) involves fertilizing both the mother's and donor's eggs with the father's sperm, then transferring the pronuclei (nuclear genetic material) from the mother's fertilized egg to the donor's fertilized egg. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 accurately describe the steps involved in each technique.  Pairs 1 and 2 incorrectly swap the steps between the two techniques.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Gene Editing Technique             Description
1.  CRISPR-Cas9                      :   Uses zinc finger proteins for targeted DNA cleavage
2.  TALEN                             :   Uses transcription activator-like effector nucleases
3.  ZFN                               :   Relies on guide RNA for targeting specific DNA sequences

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) indeed use transcription activator-like effector nucleases for gene editing, and CRISPR-Cas9 is derived from a bacterial defense mechanism.  The other options contain inaccuracies. CRISPR-Cas9 uses guide RNA for targeting, not zinc finger proteins (option 1 is incorrect). ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) utilize zinc finger proteins, not guide RNA (option 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to types of RNA, consider the following pairs:**

   RNA Type                        Function
1.  mRNA                             :   Transfers amino acids to ribosomes during translation
2.  tRNA                             :   Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
3.  rRNA                             :   Structural component of ribosomes
4.  miRNA                            :   Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation
5.  siRNA                            :   Induces gene silencing through RNA interference


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural component of ribosomes, microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are involved in RNA interference-mediated gene silencing.  The other options are incorrect. mRNA carries genetic information from DNA, not tRNA (option 1 is incorrect). tRNA transfers amino acids, not mRNA (option 2 is incorrect). Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are accurately matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                             Causative Agent
1.  Chikungunya                         :   Aedes aegypti mosquito
2.  Zika Virus                           :   Aedes albopictus mosquito
3.  Swine Flu (H1N2)                   :   Swine influenza virus
4.  Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)           :   Virus transmitted by blood-feeding insects
5.  Hepatitis C                         :   Virus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Chikungunya is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.  Swine flu is caused by the swine influenza virus. Lumpy skin disease is a viral disease spread by blood-feeding insects. Hepatitis C is caused by a virus. Although Zika virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes,  Aedes albopictus is a vector, but the primary vector is Aedes aegypti.  Therefore, all except pair 2 are correctly matched.

3. Thorium Reactor                         :   Breeds uranium-233 from thorium-232
4. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)             :   Uses natural uranium as fuel

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Fast breeder reactors utilize liquid sodium as a coolant. Thorium reactors breed fissile uranium-233 from fertile thorium-232.  Small modular reactors can utilize various fuels, including enriched uranium.  PHWRs use thermal neutrons, not fast neutrons, for fission and use natural uranium as fuel.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 correctly match the reactor type with its key feature.

GSAT-20 is correctly identified as a communication satellite. Voyager 1 is not orbiting Mars; it's exploring interstellar space.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer.  The other options contain factual inaccuracies about the satellites' purposes and locations.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Substance                     Characteristic
    1. Ethylene gas                 : Colorless, odorless, flammable gas
    2. Liquid Nitrogen              :  Inert cryogenic fluid with a temperature of -196Â°C
    3. Methanol (CH3OH)           :  Colorless, volatile liquid, completely mixable with water

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is partially incorrect. While ethylene gas is colorless and odorless, it is also flammable, a crucial safety aspect often emphasized in its applications (artificial ripening).  The description provided is therefore not entirely accurate.

Pair 2 is entirely correct.  Liquid nitrogen's properties as a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, non-corrosive, extremely cold inert cryogenic fluid with a temperature of -196Â°C are accurately described, reflecting its common use in various applications.

Pair 3 is also entirely correct. Methanol's characteristics as a colorless, fairly volatile liquid with a faintly sweet pungent odor, and its complete miscibility with water are well-established properties.  These properties are vital to understanding its applications and safety concerns.


**2. With reference to Glycemic Index (GI), consider the following pairs:**

    Factor                         Influence on GI
    1. Amylose                       : Decreases GI
    2. Dietary Fiber                 : Increases GI
    3. Cooking/Processing          : Increases GI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. Amylose, a type of starch, has a slower digestion rate than other carbohydrates, thus leading to a lower glycemic index.

Pair 2 is incorrect. Dietary fiber, due to its indigestible nature, generally *decreases* the glycemic index by slowing down glucose absorption.

Pair 3 is correct. Cooking and processing methods, such as grinding or cooking, often increase the glycemic index by breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars, making them easier and faster to digest and raise blood glucose levels.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Influenza A Virus Subtype       Characteristic
    1. LPAI viruses                  : Cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry
    2. HPAI viruses                  : Cause mild disease or no disease in poultry
    3. H5N1                           :  Avian influenza subtype


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses cause mild or no disease in poultry.  High pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause severe disease and high mortality.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  This is the opposite of the actual characteristics of LPAI and HPAI viruses.

Pair 3 is correct. H5N1 is a specific subtype of avian influenza A viruses, known for its potential to cause severe disease in birds and humans.


**4. With reference to  genome sequencing techniques, consider the following pairs:**

    Technique                       Characteristic
    1. Short-read sequencing        :  Provides long contiguous sequences, useful for complex genomes
    2. Long-read sequencing        : Generates shorter sequences, effective for abundance counting
    3. Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) :  Sequenced the entire human genome (100%)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Short-read sequencing produces shorter sequences, making it less suitable for resolving complex repetitive regions in a genome.  Long-read sequencing is better for this purpose.

Pair 2 is incorrect. This statement reverses the characteristics of short-read and long-read sequencing. Long-read sequencing is better at handling complex regions, while short-read is more suitable for abundance counting of specific sequences.

Pair 3 is correct. The T2T consortium successfully sequenced the entire human genome, including previously unsequenced regions like telomeres, achieving 100% coverage.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Medical Technology             Application
    1. Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT): Treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP)
    2. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing     : Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)
    3. Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT): Preventing transfer of mitochondrial diseases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. ERT is used to provide missing or malfunctioning enzymes to patients with specific enzyme deficiencies, including cTTP.

Pair 2 is correct.  CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has shown promise and received approvals for treating genetic blood disorders like SCD.

Pair 3 is correct. MDT is a procedure used in assisted reproduction to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from mother to child by replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Biofuel Type                  Characteristic
    1. Ethanol                       : Less expensive to produce than ethanol, but more toxic
    2. Biodiesel                     : Made through transesterification, biodegradable and non-toxic
    3. Hydrogen                      : Non-greenhouse gas emitter, abundant availability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The description seems to be a mix-up, possibly confusing ethanol with another biofuel. Ethanol is produced from biomass, usually through fermentation, and is less toxic than many other biofuels.

Pair 2 is correct. Biodiesel's production method, biodegradability, and non-toxicity are accurate descriptions of its key properties.

Pair 3 is correct. Hydrogen's key advantages as a clean energy source lie in its non-greenhouse gas emissions upon combustion and its abundant availability (though extraction and storage pose challenges).


**7. With reference to Tuberculosis (TB) treatment, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of TB                       Characteristic
    1. Latent TB Infection (LTBI)      : Prevents both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB
    2. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB): Resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin
    3. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): Resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin, plus a fluoroquinolone and at least one injectable second-line drug


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. Latent TB infection (LTBI) does not cause active disease but can progress to active TB if left untreated.  Treatment for LTBI is aimed at preventing progression to active disease.  It doesn't offer blanket protection against all forms.

Pair 2 is correct. MDR-TB's definition centers on resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most important first-line drugs.

Pair 3 is correct. XDR-TB represents a higher level of drug resistance, building upon MDR-TB with additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and at least one injectable second-line drug.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Disease                           Characteristic
    1. Sickle Cell Disease             : Characterized by mis-shaped red blood cells, blocking blood vessels
    2. Tyrosinemia Type 1             : A rare genetic disorder
    3. Gaucher's Disease               : A rare genetic disorder


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct. The description of sickle cell disease accurately reflects its pathophysiology, where abnormal hemoglobin leads to misshapen red blood cells, causing blockages in blood vessels.

Pair 2 is correct. Tyrosinemia Type 1 is indeed a rare inherited metabolic disorder.

Pair 3 is correct. Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, another type of rare genetic disorder.  The description is accurate.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space-Based Observatory               Description
1. LIGO-India                              :  A space-based gravitational wave observatory, part of a worldwide network, located in Hingoli, Maharashtra.
2. LISA                                  :  A planned advanced gravitational-wave observatory, the third of its kind, with exact specifications matching the twin LIGOs in the US.
3. Einstein Telescope                     : A proposed underground infrastructure to host a third-generation gravitational-wave observatory, with collaboration from CERN.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Einstein Telescope is correctly matched as a proposed underground third-generation gravitational-wave observatory with CERN's involvement in its vacuum system design.  LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is indeed a space-based gravitational wave observatory, but the description provided in the pair is inaccurate.  It's a planned mission, not a functioning observatory currently part of a network, and doesn't have specifications mirroring the US LIGOs. LIGO-India is also a gravitational wave observatory, but it's not space-based; it's a ground-based facility located in Hingoli, Maharashtra. Therefore, only pair 3 is accurately matched. The other options incorrectly include pairs that contain mismatched information.


**2. With reference to the characteristics of  Pulsars, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                 Description
1.  Period                               :  The time when the pulsar appears to 'switch off' as the light faces away from Earth.
2.  Electromagnetic Radiation           :  Emitted from the magnetic poles while rotating at enormous speeds.
3.  Cosmic Clocks                         :  Used by scientists due to their extremely precise intervals of radiation pulses.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The 'period' of a pulsar accurately describes the time when its radiation beam is not pointed towards Earth, causing a perceived 'switching off'.  Pulsars do indeed emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles as they rotate rapidly.  And finally, the extremely precise intervals of their pulses make them valuable tools for scientists, used as 'cosmic clocks' for various astronomical measurements.  Therefore, all three pairs offer accurate descriptions of pulsar features.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairs.


**3. With reference to Black Holes, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Black Hole                         Mass Range
1. Primordial Black Hole                     :  Hundreds of thousands of times the Sun's mass.
2. Stellar Black Hole                       :   Around one hundred to hundreds of thousands of times the Sun's mass.
3. Supermassive Black Hole                 : Formed when the centre of a large star collapses.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Stellar black holes are formed from the collapse of massive stars and their mass ranges from around one hundred to hundreds of thousands of times the mass of the Sun.  Pair 1 is incorrect; primordial black holes are theorized to have formed in the early universe and are much smaller.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; supermassive black holes are found at the centers of galaxies and are vastly larger than stellar black holes, with masses millions or even billions of times that of the Sun.  The other options incorrectly include pairs with erroneous mass ranges or formation descriptions.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Telescope                                   Feature
1.  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)     :  Primarily observes in the ultraviolet and visible spectrum.
2.  Hubble Space Telescope (HST)           :  Boasts a 6.5-meter primary mirror.
3. Spitzer Space Telescope                  :  Operates primarily in the infrared range.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Spitzer Space Telescope was indeed an infrared space telescope.  Pair 1 is incorrect; JWST primarily observes in the infrared, not the ultraviolet and visible spectrumâthat's the Hubble's strength.  Pair 2 is also incorrect; the 6.5-meter primary mirror is a feature of the JWST, not the Hubble. The other options incorrectly attribute features to the wrong telescopes, highlighting potential misconceptions about their respective capabilities and designs.



**5. With reference to the  Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                     Description
1. Location                                  :  Near Narayangaon in Pune.
2. Wavelength Range                         :  40 to 1450 MHz.
3. Operated by                               :  Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The GMRT is located near Narayangaon in Pune, and its operating frequency range is indeed 40 to 1450 MHz. However, pair 3 is incorrect; the GMRT is operated by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Pune, which is part of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, not the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. The other options mistakenly include the incorrectly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                      Description
1.  Goldilocks Zone                             :  Area around a star where it is too hot for liquid water to exist.
2.  Exoplanet                                  :  A planet within our solar system.
3.  Habitable Zone                              :  Area around a star where liquid water can exist on a planet's surface.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The habitable zone, also known as the Goldilocks zone, is the region around a star where conditions are suitable for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. Pair 1 incorrectly states that the Goldilocks zone is too hot for liquid water; it's the region where the temperature is just right. Pair 2 is incorrect because an exoplanet is a planet outside our solar system. The other options wrongly include pairs with inaccurate or incomplete descriptions.


**7. With reference to the Artemis Accords, consider the following pairs:**

   Principle                                 Description
1. Peaceful Purposes                       :  Space activities are conducted for military purposes only.
2.  Preservation of Heritage               :  Historic landing sites and artifacts on celestial bodies are not to be preserved.
3.  Mitigation of Debris                   :  Signatories plan for the safe disposal of spacecraft and limit the generation of harmful debris.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Artemis Accords emphasize the mitigation of space debris through safe spacecraft disposal and limiting the creation of harmful debris. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Accords promote peaceful uses of space, not exclusively military ones. Pair 2 is also incorrect; the Accords stress the importance of preserving the heritage of space exploration, including historic sites and artifacts. The other options incorrectly include pairs that contradict the principles of the Artemis Accords.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Solar Phenomenon                           Description
1. Solar Wind                                 :  A continuous flow of charged particles from the Sun's core.
2. Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)              :  A significant ejection of magnetic field and plasma from the Sun's corona.
3. Coronal Hole                               :  A dark, cool region on the Sun's surface, visible during a total solar eclipse.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. CMEs are indeed significant ejections of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun's corona, and coronal holes are darker, cooler regions on the Sun's surface, often associated with the origin of the solar wind.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; the solar wind originates from the Sun's corona, not its core. The other options incorrectly include the pair with an inaccurate description of the solar wind's origin.


**9. With reference to  types of  Batteries, consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                                Description
1. Lithium-ion Battery                       : Uses sodium ions as charge carriers.
2. Sodium-ion Battery (SIB)                :  A rechargeable battery where lithium ions move between electrodes.
3.  Flow Battery                              :  Consists of pairs of plates (electrodes) immersed in an electrolyte.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) utilize sodium ions for charge storage and release. Pair 1 is incorrect; lithium-ion batteries use lithium ions, not sodium ions. Pair 3 is also incorrect; flow batteries use tanks of electrolyte and a membrane, not pairs of plates immersed in an electrolyteâthat's more characteristic of standard batteries. The other options incorrectly include pairs that misrepresent the functionality of different battery types.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Type                       Description
1.  Small Modular Reactor (SMR)             :  A large-scale nuclear reactor using pressurized water for cooling.
2. Fourth-Generation Nuclear Reactor      : Uses gas (helium) for cooling.
3. Conventional Nuclear Power Plant       : Systems and components are factory-assembled and transported as a unit.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Fourth-generation nuclear reactors often employ gas cooling, such as helium, unlike conventional reactors that typically use pressurized water. Pair 1 is incorrect; SMRs are characterized by their modular design and smaller scale, not by using pressurized water cooling (though some may). Pair 3 is also incorrect; the factory assembly and transport of units is a key feature of SMRs.  The other options incorrectly associate features with the wrong reactor types.


**11. With reference to  the  International Liquid-Mirror Telescope (ILMT), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                 Description
1.  Location                                :  Devasthal Observatory, Uttarakhand, India.
2.  Mirror Type                              :  Rotating mirror made of solid glass.
3.  Collaboration                           :  Involves India, Belgium, Canada, Poland, and Uzbekistan.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The ILMT is indeed located at the Devasthal Observatory in Uttarakhand, and it's a collaborative project involving the mentioned countries.  However, pair 2 is incorrect; the ILMT uses a rotating liquid mirror, not a solid glass mirror. The other options incorrectly include the pair with a description of the mirror type that is not accurate.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Space Technology                           Description
1.  Ion Thruster Engine                       :  Relies on deflagrative combustion for propulsion.
2.  Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE) :  Uses a continuous detonation wave for propulsion.
3.  Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG):  Utilizes solar energy for power generation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The RDRE utilizes a continuous detonation wave, a key difference from traditional rocket engines. Pair 1 is incorrect; ion thrusters use electric propulsion, not deflagrative combustion. Pair 3 is also incorrect; RTGs use radioactive decay for power generation, not solar energy.  The other options incorrectly include pairs with inaccurate descriptions of propulsion or power generation methods.


**13. With reference to  Antimatter, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                Description
1. Antimatter and Gravity                  :  Antimatter falls upwards, defying gravity.
2.  Creation of Antimatter                 : Tiny quantities are produced at CERN.
3.  Matter-Antimatter Annihilation        :  Results in the creation of energy.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  CERN does produce small amounts of antimatter, and the annihilation of matter and antimatter results in energy release. Pair 1 is incorrect; current experiments show antimatter falls downwards, similar to matter.  The other options incorrectly include a pair that incorrectly states the interaction of antimatter with gravity.


**14. Consider the following pairs:**

    Spacecraft Component                      Function
1.  Radioisotope Heater Unit (RHU)          :  Converts heat into electricity.
2.  RTG (Heat-to-Electricity Conversion)  :  Generates heat through radioactive decay.
3. Thermocouple                              :  Charges batteries onboard the spacecraft.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The RTG's function is to convert heat (generated by the RHU) into electricity. Pair 1 is incorrect; the RHU generates heat, it doesn't convert it. Pair 3 is also incorrect; although a thermocouple is part of the RTG's heat-to-electricity conversion, it's not the component that directly charges the batteries. The batteries are charged by the electricity produced by the RTG.  The other options wrongly attribute functionalities to the incorrect components.


**15. With reference to  Neutrino Particles, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                 Description
1.  Mass                                   :  Very large mass.
2.  Interaction with Matter                : Rarely interacts with other matter.
3.  Types                                  : Electron neutrino, tau neutrino, and muon neutrino.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Neutrinos have a very small mass and rarely interact with other matter, earning them the nickname "ghost particles".  There are also three known types of neutrinos: electron, tau, and muon neutrinos. Pair 1 is incorrect; neutrinos have a very tiny mass, not a very large one. The other options incorrectly include the pair that misrepresents the mass of neutrinos.



Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, following all specified instructions.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biofuel Type                     Key Production Method
1. Bioethanol                        Transesterification
2. Biodiesel                         Fermentation of sugarcane juice
3. Biogas                            Anaerobic digestion of organic matter

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair, Biogas and Anaerobic digestion of organic matter is correctly matched. Bioethanol is primarily produced through fermentation of sugars (from sources like sugarcane or corn), not transesterification. Transesterification is the process used for biodiesel production, where vegetable oils or animal fats are converted into fatty acid methyl esters.  Option (b) incorrectly links biodiesel to sugarcane juice fermentation; while sugarcane juice is a feedstock for ethanol,  biodiesel uses oils and fats. Option (a) is incorrect because of the mismatched production method for bioethanol. Option (d) is wrong because it includes the incorrect pairing of Biodiesel and Fermentation.


**2. With reference to the National Hydrogen Mission, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission Component                  Specific Goal/Target
1. SIGHT Programme                  Investment of Rs. 8 lakh crore
2. Green Hydrogen Hubs              Production of 5 MMT of green hydrogen annually by 2030
3.  Electrolyzer Innovation          Development of efficient hydrogen carriers (e.g., ammonia)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. The National Hydrogen Mission aims for 5 MMT of green hydrogen production annually by 2030 through Green Hydrogen Hubs.  The SIGHT (Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition) programme focuses on funding domestic electrolyzer manufacturing and green hydrogen production, not a specific large investment figure. The target of Rs. 8 lakh crore in investment is for the entire Mission, not solely the SIGHT programme.  Electrolyzer innovation is crucial, but the development of efficient hydrogen carriers is a broader goal within the mission's technological strategies, not solely linked to electrolyzer innovation.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects a specific goal linked to a particular mission component.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Battery Type                       Key Advantage/Feature
1. Lithium-ion Battery              Abundance and low cost of primary materials
2. Sodium-ion Battery              Higher energy density compared to lithium-ion
3. Sand Battery                      Stores energy as heat, leveraging sand's thermal properties

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. Sand batteries utilize sand's thermal properties to store energy as heat. Lithium-ion batteries are known for their high energy density and relatively long lifespan, not for the abundance and low cost of their materials (lithium and cobalt are relatively scarce and expensive). Sodium-ion batteries aim to address the cost and material scarcity issues of lithium-ion, offering a lower cost alternative, but they typically have lower energy density than lithium-ion. Thus, only option (b) accurately describes a key advantage/feature for a given battery type.


**4. With reference to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), consider the following pairs:**

   CTBT Element                       Description/Function
1. International Monitoring System   On-site inspections to investigate suspected violations
2. Annex 2 States                   States whose ratification is required for the treaty to enter into force
3. CTBTO Preparatory Commission     Analysis of data from the IMS to detect nuclear explosions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Annex 2 states are those whose ratification is needed for the CTBT to come into force. The CTBTO Preparatory Commission is responsible for analyzing data from the International Monitoring System (IMS) to detect potential nuclear explosions.  However, on-site inspections are a separate mechanism under the CTBT, authorized by the Executive Council, not solely a function of the IMS itself.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the functions and elements of the CTBT.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024 directly address the management of plastic waste. The NCAP focuses on improving air quality in Indian cities, not water pollution. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 2024 deals with water pollution, not air quality.  Therefore, only option (b) correctly links the legislation with its primary focus.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene editing technology used to create the low-pungent mustard. Gene-drive technology aims to alter inheritance patterns, successfully demonstrated in reducing mosquito populations. Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), specifically Adzynma, received FDA approval for treating cTTP. Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) is a technique used in mitochondrial donation treatment, replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones. Finally, recombinant DNA technology enables gene transfer across diverse species, a cornerstone of genetic engineering.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  A comprehensive understanding of modern biotechnology techniques is crucial for this question, encompassing gene editing, gene drives, and other advanced therapies.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Technology                       Characteristic

2. Sodium-ion Battery                      :   Higher energy density than lithium-ion
3. Sand Battery                           :   Stores energy as heat using sand
4.  Vanadium Flow Batteries (VFBs)        :   Used for storing renewable energy
5. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)                   :   Fragments of DNA found outside cells

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Sand batteries utilize sand's thermal properties to store heat energy. Vanadium Flow Batteries are indeed used for renewable energy storage. Cell-free DNA refers to DNA fragments found outside of cells in bodily fluids.  Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect. Lithium-ion batteries use lithium ions, not sodium ions.  Sodium-ion batteries generally have lower energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries.  Understanding the functionalities and components of various battery technologies and the nature of cfDNA is essential to answer this question correctly.


**3. With reference to Alternative Energy Sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                                  Property
1. Methanol                                :   Less toxic than ethanol
2. Biodiesel                               :   Produces higher NOx emissions than petroleum diesel
3. Hydrogen                                 :   Produced via electrolysis using renewable energy
4.  Biogas                                  :   Produced through anaerobic digestion
5.  Graphite                               :   Used as an anode material in Lithium-ion batteries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Hydrogen can be produced through electrolysis using renewable energy sources, a process yielding "green" hydrogen. Biogas is a product of anaerobic digestion of organic matter. Graphite is a key component of lithium-ion batteries, serving as the anode material.  Methanol is more toxic than ethanol, making pair 1 incorrect. Biodiesel generally produces lower NOx emissions than petroleum diesel, making pair 2 incorrect.  This question tests the knowledge of alternative energy sources, their properties, production methods, and applications.  A good grasp of the advantages and limitations of each fuel type is needed to avoid the distractors.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nanotechnology Application                  Description
1. Hybrid Nanoparticles (gold and copper sulphide): Used for cancer detection using light
2. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)                  :   Used in high-efficiency solar cells
3.  Graphene                                 :   Poor conductor of heat and electricity
4.  Perovskite                               :   Used in LEDs and lasers
5. Lab-grown diamonds                         :   Created using High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) method


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Hybrid nanoparticles of gold and copper sulfide are indeed used in cancer detection through their photoacoustic properties. Carbon nanotubes are used in the development of high-efficiency solar cells. Perovskites find applications in LEDs and lasers due to their tunable bandgaps. Lab-grown diamonds are created using both HPHT and CVD methods.  Statement 3 is incorrect; graphene is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity.  This question demands knowledge of various nanomaterials, their properties, and diverse applications in different fields, including medicine and energy.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Genetic Engineering Concept                 Description
1. Genome Sequencing                         :   Uses only short-read techniques
2. Genome Editing                             :   Always involves alien genetic material
3. Gene-drive Technology (GDT)              :   Modifies genes to alter Mendelian inheritance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Gene-drive technology modifies genes to alter inheritance patterns, a deviation from standard Mendelian inheritance. Retrotransposons are indeed genetic elements that replicate through reverse transcription.  Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. Genome sequencing utilizes both short-read and long-read techniques. Genome editing does not always involve foreign genetic material (SDN1 and SDN2).  Not all GM crops utilize Bacillus thuringiensis; for instance, GM mustard uses genes from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.  This question tests knowledge of various genetic engineering concepts and techniques, highlighting the nuances and complexities involved.  Careful consideration of each statement is vital to avoid the distractors.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Enzyme                     Function
1. Dicer                       Cleaves long double-stranded RNA molecules into siRNAs
2. RNA Polymerase            Synthesizes DNA from an RNA template
3. RISC                        Incorporates one strand of siRNA or miRNA
4. Acrosin                     Cuts DNA at specific places


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Dicer is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in RNA interference (RNAi) by cleaving long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into shorter fragments called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).  This is a key step in the RNAi pathway, which is involved in gene silencing.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) is a multiprotein complex that binds to siRNAs or microRNAs (miRNAs).  One strand of the siRNA or miRNA guides RISC to its target mRNA molecule, leading to either mRNA degradation or translational repression. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.

RNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for synthesizing RNA from a DNA template during transcription, not the reverse.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.  Acrosin is an enzyme found in sperm that helps in the penetration of the egg during fertilization; it does not cut DNA.  Pair 4 is also incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of RNA                Function
1. mRNA                       Involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation
2. siRNA                       Involved in splicing of pre-mRNA
3. snRNA                      Plays a role in the RNA interference pathway
4. lncRNA                      Not translated into proteins


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are involved in the splicing of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), a crucial step in RNA processing where introns are removed and exons are joined to form mature mRNA.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNA that are not translated into proteins. They have diverse functions in gene regulation and other cellular processes.  Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.

Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the template for protein synthesis, not primarily involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, although it's a target of regulatory RNAs.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are involved in RNA interference (RNAi), a mechanism of gene silencing, not pre-mRNA splicing.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.  Consequently, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Gene Silencing, consider the following pairs:**

   Technique                       Mechanism
1. CRISPR-Cas9                    Degrades specific mRNA molecules
2. RNA Interference (RNAi)       Edits genes to prevent their expression
3. Transcriptional Gene Silencing Prevents transcription


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) is a mechanism where the process of transcriptionâthe synthesis of RNA from DNAâis prevented. This directly stops the production of mRNA, thereby silencing gene expression.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.

CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technology that can be used to target and modify specific DNA sequences, but its primary mechanism is not the degradation of mRNA. RNA interference (RNAi) primarily involves the degradation of specific mRNA molecules using small RNA molecules, not gene editing in the way CRISPR-Cas9 does. Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect.  Only pair 3 accurately reflects a gene silencing mechanism.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of DNA                     Characteristic
1. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)   Inherited paternally
2. Circular DNA                   Found in some viruses
3. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)  Found in chloroplasts
4. Genomic DNA                 Makes up the primary genetic material


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited maternally, not paternally.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  Circular DNA is a common structure found in the genomes of bacteria, plasmids, mitochondria, and chloroplasts,  and also some viruses. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is found in some viruses, not chloroplasts, which typically have circular DNA. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Genomic DNA comprises the primary genetic material of an organism. Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to types of DNA, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of DNA                  Location/Characteristic
1.  Supercoiled DNA            Linear structure
2.  Microsatellite DNA         Long, repeated DNA sequences
3.  Extrachromosomal DNA       Found in bacteria and mitochondria
4.  Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)   Inherited paternally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Supercoiled DNA is a form of DNA that is twisted upon itself. It is not characterized by a linear structure.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Microsatellite DNA consists of short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences, not long sequences.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. Extrachromosomal DNA,  like plasmids, is found in bacteria and also in other locations like mitochondria. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is inherited maternally, not paternally. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

  Gene Editing Technique      Description
1. TALEN                        Uses zinc finger proteins for targeting
2. CRISPR-Cas9                 Utilizes guide RNA for target specificity
3. ZFN                           Relies on transcription activator-like effector proteins
4. SDN-3                         Does not involve alien genetic material


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 technology uses a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific location in the genome, making it highly specific. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease) uses transcription activator-like effector proteins for DNA targeting.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. ZFN (Zinc Finger Nuclease) uses zinc finger proteins to target specific DNA sequences. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. SDN-3 methods involve the introduction of foreign genetic material, unlike SDN-1 and SDN-2.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched in the context of the statement.  Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Gene Therapy         Description
1. Germline Gene Therapy       Modifies somatic cells
2. Somatic Cell Gene Therapy  Modifications are inheritable
3. Gene Therapy                Treats both inherited and acquired disorders


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gene therapy encompasses treatments for both inherited genetic disorders (like haemophilia and sickle cell disease) and acquired disorders (like leukaemia).  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.  Germline gene therapy modifies germline cells (sperm or egg cells), making the changes inheritable.  Somatic cell gene therapy targets somatic cells (non-germline cells), and the modifications are not passed on to offspring. Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the GenomeIndia Project, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                            Feature
1. GenomeIndia Project               Collects 10,000 genetic samples

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GenomeIndia Project aims to collect 10,000 genetic samples from diverse Indian citizens to create a reference genome.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  The Human Genome Project was an international research effort that determined the complete human genome sequence and was completed in 2003.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. The IndiGen programme involved whole-genome sequencing of thousands of individuals representing diverse ethnic groups from India, not focusing on a single group. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrectly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Substance                     Use/Characteristic
1. Ethylene                      Not permitted for direct contact with fruits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Ethylene is permitted for artificial ripening of fruits, but its direct contact is not allowed. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. Liquid nitrogen is used in cryotherapy and for freezing and transporting food products. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Methanol ingestion can lead to severe health consequences, including permanent blindness, central nervous system damage, and even death. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. The WHO recommends an intake of less than 2000 mg of sodium per day for adults.  Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**10.  With reference to Avian Influenza, consider the following pairs:**

   Virus Type/Characteristic       Description
1. LPAI viruses                   Cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause mild or no disease in poultry.  High pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses cause severe disease and high mortality. Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are incorrectly matched.  Hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins are surface proteins on influenza A viruses that determine their subtypes. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has 183 member countries, including India. Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched. Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Solar Atmospheric Layer              Temperature Range (K)
1. Photosphere                         : 4000-8000
2. Chromosphere                        : 4000-6500
3. Transition Region                   : 500,000-8000
4. Corona                              : 500,000 or more


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1,2,3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The question tests factual recall about the temperature ranges of different layers of the Sun's atmosphere.  Option (c) is correct because the corona's temperature is indeed 500,000 K or more.  Let's analyze the other options:

Option (a) is incorrect. The photosphere's temperature range is approximately 4000 K at the top to 6500 K at the bottom, not 4000-8000 K.  This is a common misconception, as the temperature gradient within the photosphere is often overlooked.

Option (b) is incorrect. The chromosphere's temperature range is approximately 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top, not 4000-6500 K. Again, the temperature gradient within this layer is crucial to understanding the correct range.

Option (d) is incorrect because options 1, 2, and 3 are all incorrectly matched.  This option serves as a strong distractor, as it appears comprehensive but contains multiple factual errors.  A thorough understanding of solar atmospheric physics is required to eliminate this option correctly. The question highlights the importance of precise knowledge in scientific concepts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Solar Phenomenon                     Characteristic
1. Sunspot                               : Regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields
2. Coronal Hole                          : Areas of extremely strong, twisted magnetic fields
3. Solar Prominence                     : Giant explosions sending energy and particles into space
4. Solar Flare                           : Large, bright features extending from the Sun's surface


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

This question assesses the understanding of various solar phenomena and their key characteristics. Option (c) is correct because solar flares are indeed giant explosions that release energy and high-speed particles into space.  Let's look at why other options are incorrect:

Option (a) is incorrect. Sunspots are areas of strong magnetic fields, not regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields.  Coronal holes are the ones characterized by open, unipolar magnetic fields.

Option (b) is incorrect. While solar flares are accurately described, the characteristic assigned to coronal holes is incorrect. Coronal holes are associated with open magnetic fields, not extremely strong, twisted fields. This is a significant distinction that separates coronal holes from sunspots.

Option (d) is incorrect because multiple incorrect pairings are present.  Solar prominences are large bright features extending from the Sun's surface, not giant explosions.  The question tests the ability to distinguish between closely related solar phenomena and their attributes.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Space Mission/Technology        Description
1. Gaganyaan Mission                :  Uses CE-20 Cryogenic Engine
2. NavIC                             :  Has 3 geostationary and 4 inclined geosynchronous satellites
3. Solar Orbiter                      : Detected picoflare jets in coronal holes
4. LIGO                              :  Detected gravitational waves at low frequencies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question evaluates knowledge of various space missions and technologies. Option (b) is correct because NavIC indeed uses a constellation of 7 satellites (3 geostationary and 4 inclined geosynchronous) and the Solar Orbiter mission successfully detected picoflare jets originating from coronal holes. Let's examine why other options are incorrect:

Option (a) is partially correct regarding NavIC but incorrect about Gaganyaan. While Gaganyaan does utilize cryogenic technology, the specific mention of the CE-20 engine is not explicitly stated in the provided source as the only engine used.  The question tests precise knowledge and avoids vague generalizations.

Option (c) is partially correct about Solar Orbiter but incorrect about LIGO. Although LIGO has detected gravitational waves, the source specifically mentions high-frequency waves from smaller black holes and low-frequency waves from supermassive black holes.  The question highlights the need for precise data recall.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairings from options (a) and (c). This option acts as a strong distractor for those who have partial knowledge but lack precision.  The question emphasizes the importance of accuracy in scientific details.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Space-related Concept/Technology   Description
1.  Gravitational Waves              : Ripples in spacetime caused by black hole mergers.
2.  Solar Wind                        : Primarily consists of protons and electrons in a plasma state.
3.  Subduction Zone                   :  A zone where heavier tectonic plates sink under lighter ones.
4.  Cryogenic Engine                  : Uses fuels at cryogenic temperatures (-150 to -273Â°C).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of various space-related concepts and technologies. Option (d) is correct because all four pairs are accurately matched.  Gravitational waves are indeed ripples in spacetime resulting from massive cosmic events; the solar wind consists of charged particles in a plasma state; subduction zones are locations where denser tectonic plates subduct beneath lighter ones; and cryogenic engines utilize propellants at extremely low temperatures.  The question tests the factual recall of definitions and characteristics.  There are no distractors in this case, as all statements are true, making it a question of pure knowledge recall.  This is designed to assess the candidate's comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.


**5. With reference to the Sun's atmosphere, consider the following pairs:**

Layer                                 Characteristic
1. Photosphere                         : Temperature varies between 4000 K and 6500 K
2. Chromosphere                        : Temperature rises abruptly from 8000 K to 500,000 K
3. Transition Region                   :  A very narrow layer between chromosphere and corona
4. Corona                              :  Visible only during a total solar eclipse or with a coronagraph


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

This question tests detailed knowledge of the Sun's atmospheric layers. Option (b) is correct because statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe characteristics of the photosphere, transition region, and corona, respectively. Let's examine why other options are incorrect:

Option (a) is partially correct but omits statement 4, which is also true.  This acts as a distractor for those who may know the photosphere and transition region but overlook the corona's visibility.

Option (c) is incorrect because statement 2 incorrectly attributes the abrupt temperature rise to the chromosphere, when it actually occurs in the transition region. This highlights the importance of differentiating between closely related concepts.

Option (d) is incorrect because statement 2 is false, as explained above. This serves as a comprehensive distractor, appearing to encompass all layers but containing a crucial factual error.  The question effectively assesses the candidate's ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in scientific descriptions.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Technique                      Description
1. CRISPR-Cas9                               : Uses zinc finger proteins to target specific DNA sequences
2. TALEN                                      : Employs a guide RNA to direct a Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA location
3. ZFN                                         : Utilizes transcription activator-like effector nucleases for gene editing
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 correctly describes TALEN technology. TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) utilize a guide RNA molecule to direct a nuclease enzyme to a precise location within the DNA sequence. This guide RNA provides the specificity for the TALEN system to target and modify a particular gene.

Statement 1 incorrectly pairs CRISPR-Cas9 with zinc finger proteins. While both are gene editing tools, CRISPR-Cas9 uses a guide RNA, not zinc finger proteins, for targeting.  Zinc finger proteins are associated with ZFN technology.

Statement 3 correctly identifies ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) as gene editing tools, but the description is incomplete. ZFNs utilize engineered zinc finger proteins, which bind to specific DNA sequences, to direct a nuclease for DNA cleavage.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology Mission                     Objective
1. Aditya-L1                                   : Study of Jupiter's icy moons
2. JUICE                                      : Exploration of the Sun's corona and solar wind
3. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)       : Observation of distant galaxies and exoplanets
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately describes the primary objective of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  JWST's main goal is to observe distant galaxies, exoplanets, and other celestial objects in the infrared spectrum, providing insights into the early universe and the formation of planetary systems.

Statement 1 incorrectly pairs Aditya-L1 with the study of Jupiter's icy moons.  Aditya-L1 is an Indian solar mission designed to study the Sun's corona and solar wind.  The JUICE mission is focused on the Jovian system.

Statement 2 incorrectly assigns the study of the Sun's corona and solar wind to JUICE.  While JUICE will study Jupiter's environment, its main focus is on Jupiter's icy moons, not the Sun.  Aditya-L1 is the mission dedicated to solar observation.


**3. With reference to radiometric dating, consider the following pairs:**

   Isotope                                   Half-life (Years)
1. Carbon-14                               : 99,400
2. Calcium-41                              : 5,700
3. Potassium-40/Argon-40                    :  More than 1 billion
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correctly matched. Potassium-40/Argon-40 dating is used for dating geological materials much older than the range of Carbon-14 or Calcium-41 dating. Its half-life is indeed over a billion years, making it suitable for dating rocks and fossils from very ancient periods.

Statement 1 incorrectly assigns a half-life of 99,400 years to Carbon-14. The actual half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5,700 years.  This shorter half-life limits its use to dating relatively recent organic materials.

Statement 2 incorrectly assigns a half-life of 5,700 years to Calcium-41. Calcium-41 has a much longer half-life of approximately 99,400 years.  This longer half-life makes it useful for dating older materials than Carbon-14 can effectively date, but still not as old as Potassium-40/Argon-40.


**4. With reference to types of black holes, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Black Hole                       Mass Range (relative to the Sun's mass)
1. Primordial Black Hole                    : Hundreds of thousands to billions
2. Stellar Black Hole                        :  Around one hundred to hundreds of thousands
3. Supermassive Black Hole                  :  Less than 30
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 accurately reflects the mass range of stellar black holes. Stellar black holes typically have masses ranging from a few times to tens of times the mass of our Sun.  They form from the collapse of massive stars.

Statement 1 incorrectly assigns a mass range of hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses to primordial black holes. While the exact mass range is uncertain, primordial black holes are theorized to have formed in the early universe and are generally believed to be much smaller than supermassive black holes.

Statement 3 incorrectly associates a mass range of less than 30 solar masses with supermassive black holes. Supermassive black holes reside at the centers of galaxies and have masses ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of our Sun.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nanoparticle Type                       Property
1. Gold Nanoparticles                      :  High crystalline, Amorphous and Flake
2. Copper Sulphide Nanoparticles          :  High surface area, good biocompatibility
3. Graphene                               :  Good conductor of heat and electricity
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 correctly describe properties of copper sulphide and graphene nanoparticles respectively. Copper sulphide nanoparticles are known for their high surface area and good biocompatibility, making them useful in various biomedical applications. Graphene, a form of carbon, is a well-known excellent conductor of heat and electricity. These properties contribute to its use in electronics and energy storage.

Statement 1 is partially correct but incomplete. While gold nanoparticles can exist in different forms (high crystalline, amorphous, and flake), the statement only lists the forms and does not describe a property inherent to gold nanoparticles themselves.  The forms are related to their synthesis and preparation methods.  Other properties like biocompatibility are also important characteristics of gold nanoparticles.


**6. With reference to the Draft National Strategy for Robotics (NSR), consider the following pairs:**

   Robot Category                         Example
1. Industrial Robots                        :  Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
2. Service Robots                           :   Surgical Robots
3. Medical Robots                           :  Autonomous delivery robots
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Service robots encompass a wide range of applications, including autonomous delivery robots used in logistics and other sectors. Medical robots are specifically designed for surgical procedures and other medical applications, often involving high precision and minimally invasive techniques.

Statement 1 incorrectly links industrial robots with Robotic Process Automation (RPA). While RPA is a type of automation, it's software-based and doesn't directly involve physical robots in the same way as industrial robots used in manufacturing and assembly lines.  Industrial robots are primarily physical machines used in manufacturing processes.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Vaccine                            Description
1. DNA Vaccine                              :  Uses a weakened or inactivated virus to stimulate an immune response
2. Protein Subunit Vaccine                  :   Delivers genetic material (DNA or RNA) to cells to produce an antigen
3. mRNA Vaccine                              :  Contains only specific proteins from the pathogen
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately describes mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) that codes for a specific viral antigen.  The recipient's cells then produce this antigen, triggering an immune response.

Statement 1 incorrectly describes DNA vaccines as using weakened or inactivated viruses.  DNA vaccines deliver DNA encoding a viral antigen, which is then expressed by the recipient's cells.  Weakened or inactivated viruses are characteristics of traditional vaccines.

Statement 2 incorrectly defines protein subunit vaccines as delivering genetic material. Protein subunit vaccines use only purified viral proteins, not genetic material, to stimulate an immune response.  They are designed to minimize side effects compared to whole-virus vaccines.


**8. With reference to types of batteries, consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                                    Characteristic
1. Lead-Acid Battery                           : Uses sodium ions as charge carriers
2. Lithium-ion Battery                         :  Uses a solid electrolyte
3. Sodium-ion Battery                          : Employs lithium ions for energy storage
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately describes sodium-ion batteries.  Sodium-ion batteries utilize sodium ions as charge carriers, analogous to how lithium-ion batteries use lithium ions.  This is a key distinction in their electrochemical mechanisms.

Statement 1 incorrectly assigns the use of sodium ions to lead-acid batteries. Lead-acid batteries use lead and lead oxide electrodes immersed in sulfuric acid electrolyte; they do not use sodium ions.

Statement 2 incorrectly states that lithium-ion batteries use a solid electrolyte. While solid-state lithium-ion batteries are under development and offer advantages, most commercially available lithium-ion batteries utilize liquid electrolytes.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nuclear Reactor Type                      Feature
1. Fourth-generation nuclear reactor       : Uses pressurized water for cooling
2. Small Modular Reactor (SMR)             :  Modular design, factory-assembled
3. Conventional Nuclear Power Reactor     :  Uses helium for cooling
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 correctly describes a key feature of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). SMRs are designed with a modular construction, allowing for factory assembly and easier transportation to various locations. This modularity simplifies deployment and reduces construction time.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Fourth-generation reactors are characterized by advanced designs and improved safety features, but they don't universally use pressurized water cooling.  Some use different coolants like gas.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While conventional nuclear power reactors utilize various designs, helium cooling is not a typical feature of these reactors.  Pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs) are more common types.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Weather Phenomenon                   Effect
1. Solar Flares                               :  Creation of rip currents
2. Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)           :  Disruption of radio signals
3. Geomagnetic Storms                         :  Damage to power grids and pipelines
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the effects of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and geomagnetic storms. CMEs, powerful eruptions from the Sun, can release large amounts of charged particles that disrupt radio signals on Earth.  Geomagnetic storms, caused by CMEs and other solar events, can induce currents in power grids and pipelines, potentially causing damage.

Statement 1 incorrectly links solar flares to the creation of rip currents. Rip currents are strong, localized flows of water that occur near beaches, primarily due to oceanographic factors like wave patterns and nearshore bathymetry, not solar activity.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                                      Primary Objective
1. Chandrayaan-3                                   :   Soft landing near the lunar South Pole
2. Aditya-L1                                        :   Study of solar upper atmospheric dynamics
3. Gaganyaan                                       :   Sending humans to space
4. PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) :   Utilizing a spent PSLV stage as an orbital platform


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing near the Moon's South Pole, marking a significant milestone in India's space exploration program.  Aditya-L1's primary goal is the in-situ study of the Sun's upper atmosphere, including its dynamics and the processes driving space weather. The Gaganyaan mission aims to demonstrate India's capability in human spaceflight by sending astronauts into orbit.  The POEM-2 mission repurposed a spent PSLV stage, transforming it into a space-based platform for conducting scientific experiments. All four pairs accurately reflect the primary objectives of the respective space missions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The comprehensive nature of option (d) accurately represents the core mission objectives detailed in various sources.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                        Application
1. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology          :   Development of low-pungent mustard
2. 3D printing technology/Additive Manufacturing :   Production of the world's first 3D-printed rocket (Agnilet engine)
3.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)              :   Radiometric dating using Calcium-41
4.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)              :   Producing detailed images of internal body structures


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Indian researchers utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to successfully develop a low-pungent mustard variety.  The Agnilet engine, a key component of the Agnibaan SubOrbital Technological Demonstrator (SOrTeD), is notably the world's first 3D-printed rocket engine.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) has proven effective in radiometric dating using the rare isotope Calcium-41. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-established medical imaging technique used to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not represent the full scope of correctly matched technological applications. Option (d) encapsulates the accurate pairing of technologies and their applications, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the subject matter.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Fuel Type                                      Characteristic
1. Coal                                            :   Highest energy density by weight
2. Natural Gas                                     :   Burns more cleanly than coal and oil
3. Hydrogen                                        :   Low volumetric density at standard conditions
4. Dimethyl Ether (DME)                          :   High cetane number, clean-burning diesel alternative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While coal possesses a high energy density by mass, it is not the highest among the options presented. Natural gas, compared to coal and oil, burns more cleanly and produces fewer pollutants.  Hydrogen exhibits a high energy density by weight but suffers from low volumetric density, posing storage and transportation challenges. Dimethyl Ether (DME) is a clean-burning alternative to diesel fuel, characterized by its high cetane number. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of DME. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an inaccurate pairing of coal. Option (c) accurately identifies the characteristics of the fuel types, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the energy sector.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                         Characteristic/Treatment
1. Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)                       :   Caused by avian influenza Type A viruses
2. Meningitis                                      :   Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord's meninges
3. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS):   Rare side effect of some COVID-19 vaccines
4. Sickle Cell Disease                             :  Characterized by abnormal hemoglobin


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Avian influenza, or bird flu, is accurately characterized by infection with avian influenza Type A viruses. Meningitis is correctly defined as the inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.  TTS is indeed a rare but serious side effect associated with certain COVID-19 vaccines. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin in red blood cells.  Therefore, all four pairs accurately reflect the characteristics or treatments of these diseases. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to encompass the accurate matches for all four diseases. Option (d) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the diseases and their key features, signifying a strong grasp of the subject matter.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                             Focus Area
1. National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)            :   Reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations
2. National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG)        :   Rejuvenation of River Ganga
3. Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024:   Effective management of plastic waste
4. Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)            :   Food safety standards


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a genome editing tool used in Adzynma, the world's first recombinant protein product approved for treating cTTP.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Indian researchers utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to develop a low-pungent mustard variety, making pair 2 correct.  However, the sequencing of the Y chromosome primarily employed long-read genome sequencing techniques, not TALENs.  TALENs are another genome editing tool, but their application is not specifically linked to Y-chromosome sequencing in the provided text. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched. Option (b) is the only option that accurately reflects the correct pairings.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the applications of different genome editing technologies.


**2. With reference to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and Gene Editing, consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are both techniques used in mitochondrial donation treatment ("three-parent baby" technology), aiming to replace a mother's faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. However, the descriptions of short-read and long-read sequencing are reversed in pairs 3 and 4.  Short-read sequencing fragments the genome into smaller pieces, while long-read sequencing generates longer sequences for easier assembly.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the mismatched pairs related to sequencing techniques.  Option (a) accurately identifies only the correctly matched pairs concerning mitochondrial transfer techniques, showcasing a precise understanding of the processes involved in "three-parent baby" technology.


**4. With reference to Genome Sequencing techniques, consider the following pairs:**

    Technique                        Characteristic
1.  Short-read sequencing           :  Effective for counting specific sequences.
2.  Long-read sequencing           :  Handles repetitive sequences more easily.
3.  Aerial metagenomics            :  Direct genetic analysis of genomes from air samples.

**Explanation:**

Short-read sequencing excels at quantifying specific sequences, making it suitable for applications like transcript profiling.  Long-read sequencing, with its ability to handle long, repetitive sequences, proved crucial in completely sequencing the complex Y chromosome. Aerial metagenomics directly analyzes microbial DNA from air samples. Therefore pairs 1, 2, and 3 are all correctly matched.  However, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium achieved 100% sequencing of the human genome, not just 92%, which was the achievement of the original Human Genome Project.  Option (a) accurately reflects the correct matching of the three pairs, demonstrating a strong understanding of different genome sequencing approaches and their applications. The other options contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Concept                         Description

**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The Glycemic Index (GI) accurately measures the rate at which a carbohydrate-containing food elevates blood glucose levels.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  However, the Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the GI and the quantity of carbohydrates in a serving to estimate the blood sugar response, not ranking foods on a 0-100 scale directly.  Avian influenza is caused by influenza A viruses, not influenza B viruses. Finally, space weather is predominantly influenced by solar activity, not Jupiter's activities.  Only pair 1 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer. The other options include at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the importance of precise definitions and understanding of scientific concepts.

1. Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR): Applies only to producers of plastic packaging
2. Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) Rules, 2024: Mandates annual assessment of plastic waste by local bodies
3.  PWM Rules, 2016 (amended): Introduced EPR system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The 2024 amendment to the Plastic Waste Management Rules does mandate annual assessments by local bodies, and the 2016 PWM Rules (as amended) introduced the EPR system. However, statement 1 is incorrect; EPR applies to producers, importers, and brand owners of plastic packaging, not just producers. Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**10. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material/Technology                  Characteristic/Use
1. Lithium-ion Battery                    : Uses sodium ions as charge carriers
2.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)       :  Are always less than 30 MWe in capacity
3.  Net Energy Gain (NEG) in Fusion     : Achieved when energy output exceeds energy input


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Net Energy Gain in nuclear fusion reactions means the energy produced surpasses the energy invested in the process. Statement 1 is incorrect; Lithium-ion batteries utilize lithium ions, not sodium ions.  Statement 2 is incorrect; SMRs have a capacity ranging from less than 30 MWe to 300+ MWe, not exclusively below 30 MWe.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**11.  With reference to Rare Earth Elements (REEs), consider the following pairs:**

    REE/Concept                         Description
1. Rare Earth Oxides                    :   Are a group of 17 elements including Scandium and Yttrium
2.  Red Mud                              :   Is a byproduct of aluminum extraction containing REEs
3.  Vanadium                             :   Is not classified as a critical mineral


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Rare Earth Oxides do encompass 17 elements, including Scandium and Yttrium, and red mud from bauxite processing contains REEs. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Vanadium is indeed classified as a critical mineral by India.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.


**12. Consider the following pairs:**

    Material/Concept                       Characteristic/Use
1. Lab-grown Diamonds                     :   Always have impurities ingrained
2.  Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)        :   Electrical resistance unaffected by magnetic fields
3.  Graphene                              :   Two-dimensional single-atom-thick layer of carbon


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Graphene is accurately described as a two-dimensional single-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms. Statement 1 is incorrect; Lab-grown diamonds are typically pure and free from impurities, unlike natural diamonds. Statement 2 is incorrect; GMR is precisely the phenomenon where electrical resistance *is* affected by magnetic fields in adjacent materials. Therefore, only option (c) is correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.  Due to the extensive nature of the target content,  I will provide a representative sample of questions covering various sections.  Generating all possible questions within the token limit is not feasible.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                           Application
1. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology : Development of low-pungent mustard
2. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)        : Treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP)
3.  Recombinant DNA technology       : Production of Adzynma, a recombinant protein product

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched.  The text explicitly states that Indian researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to develop a low-pungent mustard variety.

Pair 3 is also correctly matched. The passage mentions that Adzynma, the world's first recombinant protein product approved for cTTP treatment, is a result of recombinant DNA technology, a process that allows genes to be transferred across different species.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While ZFNs are a genome editing technique, the text doesn't link them specifically to the treatment of cTTP.  The treatment of cTTP is linked to  Adzynma, a product of recombinant DNA technology.  The distractor here plays on the general knowledge of genome editing techniques and their applications in medicine.


**2. With reference to alternative energy sources, consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Source                     Characteristic
1. Biodiesel                          : Produced through fermentation
2. Hydrogen                           :  Produces water vapor during combustion
3. Sodium-ion battery                 : Higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched. The text clearly states that hydrogen, when used as a fuel, produces water vapor, a non-greenhouse gas, during combustion.

Pair 1 is incorrect. Biodiesel is produced through transesterification, not fermentation. Fermentation is a process associated with alcohol production from biomass. This is a deliberate distractor, playing on the common association of both processes with biofuels.

Pair 3 is incorrect.  The provided text indicates that sodium-ion batteries typically have a *lower* energy density compared to lithium-ion batteries. This is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall information.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Disease                                  Characteristic/Treatment
1. Tuberculosis (TB)                       : Prevented by BPaL drug
2. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)              : Cured by bone marrow transplant
3.  Meningitis                              :  Caused by bacteria only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correctly matched. The text explicitly states that stem cell or bone marrow transplants are the only cure for Sickle Cell Disease.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions BPaL as a treatment for XDR-TB, it doesn't state that it prevents all forms of TB.  The distractor uses a related but not entirely accurate fact to confuse the candidate.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Meningitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, not solely bacteria. This distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the broader context of the disease.


**4. With reference to space technology, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission/Technology                     Description
1.  Chandrayaan-3                       :  First successful soft landing on the Moon's south pole
2.  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) :  Observes gravitational waves
3.  Juno Mission                         :  Studies Jupiter and its moons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Chandrayaan-3 achieved a successful soft landing on the Moon's south pole, a significant milestone. The Juno mission is explicitly described as studying Jupiter and its moons.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The James Webb Space Telescope observes infrared light and other electromagnetic radiation, not gravitational waves.  Gravitational waves are detected by different instruments like LIGO.  This distractor cleverly uses related concepts in astronomy to test the candidate's specific knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Technology/Concept            Description/Application
1.  MRI Technology                        : Uses ionizing radiation
2.  Cell-free DNA (cfDNA)                : Detects genetic abnormalities in fetuses
3.  Phage Therapy                         :  Uses viruses to treat bacterial infections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The text explains that phage therapy uses viruses (phages) to combat bacterial infections.

Pair 1 is incorrect. MRI technology uses strong magnets and radio waves, *not* ionizing radiation.  This is a key difference that distinguishes it from other medical imaging techniques.

Pair 2 is correct, but it is a distractor.  While cfDNA can be used to detect genetic abnormalities in fetuses, it is not the only way.  The question tests the ability to discern an accurate statement from a more comprehensive statement.


These examples demonstrate the creation of difficult, UPSC-style MCQs that require factual recall, analysis, and the ability to distinguish between closely related concepts.  Remember to consult authentic sources for verification of factual details.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                     Technology/Component
1. Chandrayaan-3                    :  Cryogenic Engine CE-20
2. Aditya-L1                         :  Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) LEX
3. Gaganyaan Mission                :  Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE-200)
4. PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) : Vikas Engines

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 utilized various technologies, but the Cryogenic Engine CE-20 is associated with the GSLV Mk III, a launch vehicle capable of carrying heavier payloads, which is relevant to future missions like Chandrayaan. The Semi-Cryogenic Engine (SCE-200) is indeed being developed for the Gaganyaan mission, aiming to enhance payload capacity.  The Aditya-L1 mission, focused on solar observation, isn't directly linked to the RLV LEX, which is a reusable launch vehicle technology test.  The PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-2 (POEM-2) uses the spent fourth stage of the PSLV, which uses solid and liquid engines, not specifically Vikas engines.  Vikas engines are a type of liquid-propellant rocket engine used in some ISRO launch vehicles, but POEM-2 leverages existing PSLV stages. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the technological relationships between the space missions and their key components.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Biotechnology Concept           Description/Application
1. Genome Editing                  :  Production of low-pungent mustard using CRISPR/Cas9
2. CAR-T Cell Therapy              :  Treatment involving genetically modified T cells
3. Stem Cells                        :  Use of liquid nitrogen for cryopreservation
4. Tissue Culture                    :  Growth of plants in a controlled environment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Genome editing, specifically using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, is accurately described in its application to create a low-pungent mustard variety.  CAR-T cell therapy correctly involves the genetic modification of T cells to target cancer cells.  Tissue culture is a standard technique for plant propagation in controlled settings. However, the description of stem cell use is incorrect; while stem cells might be cryopreserved using liquid nitrogen, this is not a defining characteristic of stem cell technology itself.  Stem cells are pluripotent cells with the ability to differentiate into various cell types, a far broader concept than cryopreservation. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, while option 3 presents an inaccurate association.


**3. With reference to Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), consider the following pairs:**

   Battery Type                      Characteristic/Example
1. Lead-Acid Battery                :  High energy density
2. Lithium-ion Battery              :  Memory effect
3. Sodium-ion Battery (SIB)         :  Low cost and abundance of sodium resources
4. Flow Batteries                    :  Uses tanks of electrolyte

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Sodium-ion batteries are indeed known for their low cost and the abundance of sodium, a key advantage over lithium-ion alternatives. Flow batteries are inherently defined by their use of tanks of electrolyte for energy storage.  However, Lead-acid batteries are not characterized by high energy density; they have a relatively low energy density compared to other battery types. The "memory effect" is associated with older Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) batteries, not Lithium-ion batteries, which have largely overcome this issue. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                            Description
1. Size                               :  Larger than conventional nuclear reactors
2. Modularity                         :  Factory-assembled components for easier transportation and installation
3. Refueling Interval                 :  Shorter than traditional reactors
4. Safety Features                   :  Includes passive safety mechanisms for shutdown and cooling

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The modular design of SMRs is a crucial aspect, enabling factory assembly and easier transportation.  SMRs also incorporate passive safety features to enhance safety during abnormal situations.  However, SMRs are explicitly designed to be smaller than traditional nuclear reactors; their compact size is a key advantage.  The refueling interval for SMRs is significantly *longer* than that of traditional reactors, not shorter.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched, highlighting the key features of SMR technology.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Alternative Energy Technology      Description/Application
1. Li-ion Battery                     : Used in electric automobiles
2.  Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) Battery : Stores energy as electrochemical or chemical energy
3.  Gravity Battery                   : Involves lifting and lowering a heavy weight to store energy
4. Biodegradable Paper Supercapacitor : Made from seaweed

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Lithium-ion batteries are widely utilized in electric vehicles. Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACC) batteries encompass a broader category of advanced storage technologies, including both electrochemical and chemical energy storage mechanisms.  Gravity batteries operate on the principle of lifting and lowering weights to store and release energy.  Biodegradable paper supercapacitors, a novel technology, are indeed developed using seaweed as a base material.  All the pairs accurately reflect the characteristics and applications of these alternative energy technologies.


**6.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Material                           Property/Application
1. Graphene                          :  Low thermal conductivity
2. Lab-grown Diamonds               :  Created using HPHT or CVD methods
3. Vanadium                          :  Used in vanadium flow batteries
4. Tantalum                           :  High corrosion resistance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Lab-grown diamonds are produced using High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) techniques. Vanadium finds application in vanadium flow batteries for energy storage. Tantalum is indeed known for its exceptional corrosion resistance, making it suitable for various applications. However, graphene is characterized by its *high* thermal conductivity, not low.  Its exceptional thermal properties are a key reason for its exploration in various applications. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Technology Concept          Description/Example
1. Solar Flares                       : Continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun
2. Solar Winds                        : Intense, localized emission of electromagnetic radiation
3. Antimatter                         : Produced in particle accelerators
4. Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV)    : Successfully tested with RLV LEX mission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Antimatter is indeed produced artificially using particle accelerators. The Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) technology was successfully demonstrated through the RLV LEX mission. However, the descriptions of solar flares and solar winds are reversed. Solar flares are intense bursts of radiation, while solar winds are a continuous stream of charged particles.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 correctly match the concepts to their descriptions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health Technology/Concept        Description/Application
1. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) : Uses ionizing radiation
2.  Ethylene                           : Used for artificial ripening of fruits within limits
3.  Liquid Nitrogen                    : Used in cryotherapy
4.  Methanol                          : Can cause permanent blindness if ingested

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Ethylene is permitted for fruit ripening within specific concentration limits. Liquid nitrogen has applications in cryotherapy, a medical procedure. Methanol ingestion can lead to severe health consequences, including blindness.  However, MRI does *not* use ionizing radiation; it employs magnetic fields and radio waves.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                  Description/Example
1. Radiometric Dating                       : Uses Calcium-41 as a dating method
2.  Draft National Strategy for Robotics   : Implemented by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)
3.  Hybrid Nanoparticles                   : Made of gold and copper sulfide to cure cancer cells using heat
4.  White Phosphorus                      : Used as an incendiary agent in military applications

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Radiometric dating techniques now include the use of Calcium-41. The Draft National Strategy for Robotics is indeed implemented by MeitY.  Hybrid nanoparticles combining gold and copper sulfide are used in cancer treatment as described. White phosphorus is employed as an incendiary agent in military applications.  All four pairs accurately reflect the concepts and their respective descriptions or applications.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Space Mission                        Primary Objective
1. Chandrayaan-3                     :   Soft landing on the Moon's south pole
2. Aditya-L1                           :   Study of the Sun's corona
3.  JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) :   Exploration of Mars's moons
4. OSIRIS-APEX (OSIRIS-Apophis Explorer): Sample return mission from asteroid Bennu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Chandrayaan-3 successfully achieved a soft landing on the Moon's south pole, making India the fourth country to accomplish this feat.  Aditya-L1 is designed to study the Sun's corona and its dynamics, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections. OSIRIS-REx, now renamed OSIRIS-APEX, successfully collected samples from asteroid Bennu and returned them to Earth.  The JUICE mission, however, focuses on Jupiter and its icy moons (Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa), not Mars's moons.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes Chandrayaan-3. Option (b) is incorrect because it excludes OSIRIS-APEX. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched JUICE mission.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Technology                                 Key Feature/Application
1. Genome Editing (CRISPR/Cas9)           :   Altering the DNA of organisms, including plants
2.  3D Printing                              :   Creating objects layer by layer from a digital design
3.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)                :   Processing natural language
4.  Radiometric Dating (using Calcium-41) :   Determining the age of objects older than 50,000 years

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for genome editing, enabling precise modifications to an organism's DNA, including plants, animals, and bacteria.  3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that builds three-dimensional objects layer by layer from a digital model. Artificial intelligence encompasses various techniques, including natural language processing.  However, radiometric dating using Carbon-14 has limitations in determining the age of objects older than approximately 50,000 years; Calcium-41, while used in radiometric dating, doesn't overcome this specific limitation of Carbon-14.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair or including the incorrectly matched pair related to radiometric dating.


**3. With reference to Nanotechnology and Materials Science, consider the following pairs:**

   Material                                      Property/Application
1. Graphene                                    :   Low thermal conductivity
2.  Lab-grown Diamonds                        :   Used in high-power laser diodes as heat spreaders
3.  Hybrid Nanoparticles (gold and copper sulphide) :   Used for cancer detection using X-rays
4.  Tantalum                                     :   High corrosion resistance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Graphene is renowned for its exceptional thermal conductivity, not low thermal conductivity. Lab-grown diamonds, due to their high thermal conductivity, are indeed used as heat spreaders in high-power laser diodes. Hybrid nanoparticles of gold and copper sulphide are used in cancer therapy and detection, leveraging their photoacoustic and photothermal properties to generate ultrasound waves and heat for treatment; the detection, however, is not through X-rays but ultrasound. Tantalum exhibits very high corrosion resistance, making it suitable for various applications.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pair 1 or 3, or both.


**4. With reference to Space Technology and Exploration, consider the following pairs:**

   Telescope/Observatory                     Key Characteristic/Finding
1. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)      :   Observed fully formed galaxies earlier than predicted by the standard model
2.  SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) :   Operates from a ground-based location
3.  Ice Cube Observatory                    :   Detects neutrinos
4.  Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KSO)      :   Studies solar flares


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

JWST has made groundbreaking observations, including detecting fully formed galaxies that challenge the standard cosmological model.  SOFIA was an airborne observatory, not ground-based. The Ice Cube Observatory is designed to detect neutrinos from deep space. The Kodaikanal Solar Observatory does indeed study solar flares and other solar phenomena.
