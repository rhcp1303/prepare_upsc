(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) are a type of nuclear reactor that uses fast neutrons to induce fission in fissile material, primarily plutonium-239.  The "fast" designation refers to the high energy of the neutrons, which are not slowed down by a moderator as in other reactor types. This characteristic is crucial for their breeding capability.  Liquid sodium is a common coolant choice in FBRs because it does not moderate neutrons, allowing the fast neutron spectrum to be maintained.  A key feature of FBRs is their ability to breed fissile material, converting fertile isotopes like uranium-238 into fissile plutonium-239. This extends the usable lifespan of nuclear fuel and reduces the amount of waste.  Initially, many FBRs use MOX fuel, a mixture of uranium and plutonium oxides.  Statement 5 is incorrect; FBRs do *not* operate at atmospheric pressure. They operate under high pressure to maintain the coolant in its liquid state and ensure efficient heat transfer.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe FBRs.

4.  Thermocouples are used in RTGs to convert heat into electricity.


How many of the above statements accurately describe RTGs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

RTGs utilize radioactive decay to produce heat, which is then converted into electricity (statement 1 is partially correct, it doesn't generate electricity directly but through heat conversion).  The Radioisotope Heater Unit (RHU) generates the heat; the conversion to electricity happens in a separate component of the RTG (statement 2 is partially incorrect).  RTGs are indeed independent of solar proximity (statement 3). Thermocouples are the key components that convert the heat difference into electrical energy (statement 4).  Therefore, three statements are largely correct, though some need minor clarifications.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, specifically Article 246, clearly defines the division of powers regarding taxation between the Union and the States, listing the subjects under the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 269 of the Constitution deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States.  This demonstrates a key aspect of fiscal federalism where the central government collects certain taxes but distributes a portion to the states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Union Government plays a significant role, the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union is not solely determined by it.  The Finance Commission's recommendations heavily influence this distribution, ensuring a balance of power and resources between the Union and States.  Article 270 outlines this process.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Constitution does *not* prohibit discretionary grants. Article 282 allows the Union or a State to make grants for any public purpose, even outside their legislative competence. This flexibility is a crucial element of fiscal federalism, allowing for targeted assistance where needed.

Statement 5 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and generally followed, they are not legally binding.  The Union and State governments retain the ultimate authority in deciding on the allocation of resources, although ignoring the Commission's recommendations would be politically unwise.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. Nuclear fusion takes place in a plasma state, where atoms are stripped of their electrons. The Coulomb barrier, arising from the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged nuclei, presents a significant hurdle in achieving fusion. Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is a promising fuel source for fusion reactions. Statement 1 is incorrect; fusion involves the *combining* of light atomic nuclei, not splitting of heavy nuclei (which is fission). Statement 4 is incorrect; currently, controlled nuclear fusion reactions do not yet produce a net energy gain – the energy input exceeds the energy output.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Artemis Accords:**

1. They are a binding international treaty.
2.  They promote the peaceful use of outer space.
3.  They mandate the sharing of all space resources.
4.  They were initiated solely by NASA.
5.  They address the preservation of heritage sites on celestial bodies.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the principles and goals of the Artemis Accords?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four



**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 5 are correct. The Artemis Accords emphasize the importance of peaceful exploration and utilization of outer space, adhering to international law.  They also recognize the need to preserve historical sites and artifacts on celestial bodies for scientific and cultural reasons. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Accords are a set of *non-binding* principles. Statement 3 is incorrect; while they encourage the sustainable use of space resources, they don't mandate equal sharing. Statement 4 is incorrect; while NASA played a key role, the Accords were initiated by the US State Department and involved multiple founding members.


**9. Consider the following regarding the properties of Antimatter:**

1.  It was first theorized by Albert Einstein.
2.  It annihilates upon contact with matter.
3.  It is readily abundant in the universe.
4.  CERN has successfully created significant quantities of antimatter.
5.  Experiments at CERN suggest antimatter falls downwards under gravity.

How many of the above statements accurately describe antimatter and its properties?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 5 are correct. Antimatter does indeed annihilate upon contact with matter, releasing a large amount of energy. Experiments at CERN using the ALPHA experiment have indicated that antimatter behaves similarly to matter under the influence of gravity, falling downwards. Statement 1 is incorrect; the existence of antimatter was first theorized by Paul Dirac, not Albert Einstein. Statement 3 is incorrect; antimatter is extremely rare in the universe. Statement 4 is incorrect; while CERN has produced antimatter, the quantities are still extremely small, measured in nanograms.


**10. Consider the following about different types of rocket engines:**

1. Cryogenic engines utilize fuels at very high temperatures.
2.  The CE-20 cryogenic engine uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants.
3.  Semi-cryogenic engines use liquid hydrogen as fuel.
4.  The Vikas engine is used in the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle.
5.  The Agnilet engine is a 3D-printed, semi-cryogenic engine.


How many of the above statements accurately describe characteristics of various rocket engine technologies?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct.  The CE-20 is a cryogenic engine using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The Vikas engine is used in lower stages of the LVM3. The Agnilet engine is a notable example of a 3D-printed semi-cryogenic engine. Statement 1 is incorrect; cryogenic engines use fuels at *very low* temperatures. Statement 3 is incorrect; semi-cryogenic engines use refined kerosene, not liquid hydrogen, as fuel.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Uses site-directed nucleases (SDNs) to modify DNA.
2.  Can involve the addition, deletion, or substitution of nucleotides.
3.  May utilize CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
4.  Can be used to reduce the pungency of mustard plants.
5.  Always involves alien genetic material.

How many of the above statements accurately describe genome editing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe genome editing.  Site-directed nucleases are indeed used to make precise changes in the DNA sequence, which can involve the addition, deletion, or substitution of nucleotides. CRISPR/Cas9 is a widely used and effective genome editing technology.  Statement 4 is also true; genome editing was used to create a less pungent mustard variety.  However, statement 5 is incorrect.  While some genome editing techniques might use foreign genes (SDN3), others like SDN1 and SDN2 do not. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Involves lifting and lowering a heavy weight.
2.  Utilizes kinetic energy to generate electricity.
3.  Is categorized under electrochemical storage systems.
4.  Can use solar energy for charging.
5.  Is an example of a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS).

How many of the above statements accurately describe a gravity battery?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe a gravity battery.  It functions by lifting (charging) and lowering (discharging) a heavy weight, converting potential energy into kinetic energy, which is then used to generate electricity. However, statements 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect. A gravity battery is not an electrochemical storage system; it's a purely mechanical system. While it can be *charged* using solar energy (or any other source), that’s not inherent to its design.  Finally, it is not a type of BESS (Battery Energy Storage System), which relies on electrochemical processes.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  A type of galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole.
2.  Emits highly energetic particles and radiation.
3.  Is observed using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).
4.  Is associated with the phenomenon of time dilation.
5.  Is a brief burst of electromagnetic radiation.

How many of the above statements accurately describe a blazar?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe a blazar. Blazars are indeed active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes, emitting highly energetic radiation.  The observed brightening of BL Lacertae, a blazar, is relevant here. The phenomenon of time dilation is also associated with black holes, which power blazars. Statement 3 is incorrect; while radio telescopes are used in astronomy, the text doesn't specify GMRT's use in blazar observation. Statement 5 describes a Fast Radio Burst (FRB), not a blazar.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Is a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona.
2.  Consists mainly of electrons, protons, and alpha particles.
3.  Interacts with Earth's magnetosphere.
4.  Is detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
5.  Its intensity varies with the Sun's activity cycle.

How many of the above statements accurately describe solar wind?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 accurately describe solar wind.  Solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles (mainly electrons, protons, and alpha particles) emanating from the Sun's corona. It interacts with Earth's magnetosphere, causing phenomena like auroras and geomagnetic storms. The intensity of solar wind does indeed vary with the Sun's activity cycle. Statement 1 is true but slightly imprecise: the corona is where the solar wind *originates*, not just where it's found. Statement 4 is incorrect; JWST is primarily an optical and infrared telescope, not designed for direct solar wind detection.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Uses a combination of liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) as propellants.
2.  Is used in the PSLV launch vehicle.
3.  Powers the upper stage of the LVM3 launch vehicle.
4.  Is a semi-cryogenic engine.
5.  Is a three-stage launch vehicle itself.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the CE-20 Cryogenic Engine?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 3 correctly describe the CE-20 Cryogenic Engine. It uses LOX and LH2 as propellants and is used to power the upper stage of the LVM3 (now known as GSLV Mk III) launch vehicle.  Statements 2, 4, and 5 are incorrect. The CE-20 is not part of the PSLV; it's associated with the LVM3. It's a cryogenic engine, not semi-cryogenic (that would describe the SCE-200). And the CE-20 is an *engine*, not a multi-stage launch vehicle.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  Aims to launch small satellites into Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
2.  Is a three-stage launch vehicle using solid and liquid propulsion.
3.  Has a payload capacity of up to 500 kg.
4.  Includes a Velocity Trimming Module (VTM).
5.  Carried the AzaadiSAT satellite on its inaugural flight.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe the SSLV.  It's designed to launch small satellites into LEO, utilizes a three-stage configuration (with solid and liquid propulsion stages including a VTM), has a payload capacity of up to 500 kg, and indeed carried the AzaadiSAT satellite on its inaugural SSLV-D1/EOS-02 mission.  There are no inaccuracies in any of the provided statements regarding the SSLV.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  Is a method used to establish the age of objects.
2.  Utilizes the decay of radioactive isotopes.
3.  Can be used to determine the age of objects older than 50,000 years.
4.  Relies on the principle of carbon-14 decay.
5.  Can determine the age of non-living things like rocks.

How many of the above statements accurately describe radiometric dating?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe radiometric dating. It is a method used to determine the age of objects by analyzing the decay of radioactive isotopes within them. However, statement 3 is incorrect; carbon-14 dating, a specific type of radiometric dating, has limitations for objects older than approximately 50,000 years.  While carbon-14 is a common isotope used, other isotopes are used for dating older materials. Statement 5 is also false; while some radiometric dating methods can be applied to rocks (e.g., potassium-argon dating), carbon-14 dating is specifically for organic matter.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Is a type of rechargeable battery.
2.  Uses lithium ions as charge carriers.
3.  Uses ether as an electrolyte.
4.  Was co-invented by John Bannister Goodenough.
5.  Is widely used in electric vehicles.

How many of the above statements accurately describe a lithium-ion battery?


(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe a lithium-ion battery.  It's a rechargeable battery that utilizes the movement of lithium ions between electrodes for charging and discharging.  Ether-based electrolytes are commonly used. John Bannister Goodenough played a crucial role in its development, and it's widely used in electric vehicles and many portable electronics.  There are no inaccuracies among the provided statements.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  Involves using lasers for communication.
2.  Is limited to communication within the Earth-Moon system.
3.  Offers significantly higher bandwidth than traditional RF communication.
4.  Is less susceptible to atmospheric interference than RF.
5.  Is currently being tested by NASA's Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD).

How many of the above statements accurately describe Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC)?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 accurately describe DSOC. It uses lasers for communication, offering significantly higher bandwidth than radio frequencies (RF). NASA's LCRD is a key initiative testing and demonstrating the technology. Statement 2 is incorrect; DSOC is specifically designed for communication *beyond* the Earth-Moon system. Statement 4 is partially true; infrared wavelengths are used to mitigate atmospheric effects, but atmospheric interference is still a factor.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Is a phenomenon where a shadow vanishes at midday.
2.  Occurs for locations between the tropics.
3.  Is caused by the Earth's axial tilt.
4.  Is directly related to solar flares.
5.  Is observable only during a solar eclipse.

How many of the above statements accurately describe a "Zero Shadow Day"?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 2 accurately describe a Zero Shadow Day.  It's a phenomenon where the sun is directly overhead, causing vertical objects to cast no shadow.  This occurs for locations between the tropics due to the Earth's revolution around the sun. Statement 3 is partially true; the Earth's axial tilt and its position relative to the sun are factors, but the primary cause is the sun's position directly overhead. Statements 4 and 5 are incorrect; Zero Shadow Day is not directly related to solar flares and is observable on any clear day when the sun is at its zenith, not just during an eclipse.


**1. Consider the following properties of a material:**

1. High surface area
2. Excellent thermal conductivity
3. Good biocompatibility
4.  Allotropes of carbon
5. Produced from coke and pith

How many of the above are characteristics of Graphene?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Graphene possesses high surface area, excellent thermal conductivity, and good biocompatibility.  These are inherent properties directly related to its atomic structure and bonding.  Option 4, "Allotropes of carbon," is correct because graphene is an allotrope of carbon, meaning it's a structural form of carbon. However,  option 5, "Produced from coke and pith," is incorrect. While synthetic graphene can be produced from various carbon sources,  coke and pith are not the primary or exclusive sources.  Synthetic graphene production methods frequently involve chemical vapor deposition or reduction of graphene oxide, processes that don't directly utilize coke and pith. Therefore, only three of the listed properties are accurate characteristics of graphene. The inclusion of "produced from coke and pith" acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of graphene synthesis.


**2. Consider the following statements about Calcium-41:**

1. It has a half-life of 5,700 years.
2. It is produced through cosmic ray interactions in the soil.
3. It is a more frequent occurrence than Carbon-14.
4. It can be used in radiometric dating.
5. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used with it.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding Calcium-41?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 ("It is produced through cosmic ray interactions in the soil") and statement 4 ("It can be used in radiometric dating") are correct. Calcium-41's formation is indeed linked to cosmic ray interactions within the Earth's crust, making it a useful tool in certain dating methods. Statement 5 ("Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a technique used with it") is also accurate, as ATTA is a specific technique employed for analyzing Calcium-41 in radiometric dating.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; Calcium-41's half-life is significantly longer (99,400 years), not 5,700 years (that's Carbon-14's half-life).  Statement 3 is also false; Calcium-41 occurs less frequently than Carbon-14. The inclusion of these incorrect statements with close, yet inaccurate values, increases the difficulty and tests the candidate's precise knowledge.


**3. Consider the following applications of Robotic Process Automation (RPA):**

1. Performing repetitive office tasks of human workers.
2.  Designing and constructing robots.
3. Integrating APIs and UI interactions for repetitive tasks.
4.  Operating medical robots in surgical procedures.
5. Creating an up-skilling and re-skilling ecosystem in emerging technologies.

How many of the above are correct applications or features of RPA?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

RPA primarily focuses on automating repetitive office tasks (1) by utilizing intelligent automation technologies that integrate Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and user interface (UI) interactions (3).  Options 2, 4, and 5 are incorrect. Designing and constructing robots falls under the broader field of robotics, not specifically RPA. Operating medical robots is a specialized application of robotics in the medical field, distinct from the office-based automation that defines RPA.  Creating an up-skilling ecosystem is a goal of projects *utilizing* RPA, but it's not a direct application of the technology itself. The inclusion of these closely related but distinct applications makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's nuanced understanding of RPA's scope.


**4. Consider the following statements about Nanohybrids:**

1. They are usually less than 8 nm in size.
2. They are made by combining at least two different nanoparticles.
3. They always contain gold and copper sulphide.
4. They absorb light and generate ultrasound waves for diagnosis.
5. They produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for cancer treatment.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Nanohybrids?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 accurately describe nanohybrids.  Nanohybrids are indeed typically smaller than 8 nm, and their creation involves combining at least two different nanoparticles.  Their photoacoustic properties enable light absorption and ultrasound wave generation for diagnostic purposes, while their photothermal properties generate heat and ROS, which can be used for cancer treatment.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the example in the text mentions gold and copper sulphide,  nanohybrids are not limited to this specific combination. Many other nanoparticle combinations can form nanohybrids. The inclusion of the false statement about specific components creates a challenging distractor.


**5. Consider the following regarding White Phosphorus:**

1. It's a waxy, yellowish-to-clear chemical with a pungent, garlic-like odor.
2. It's used exclusively as a component in fertilizers and food additives.
3. It spontaneously catches fire in air when in contact with oxygen.
4.  Its use in civilian areas is considered a war crime.
5. It is a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention.

How many of the above statements are correct about White Phosphorus?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. White phosphorus does indeed have the described physical and chemical properties, its incendiary nature is well-known, and its use against civilians is widely condemned as a war crime. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while it has applications in fertilizers and food additives, it's not *exclusively* used for these purposes.  Statement 5 is also false;  White phosphorus is specifically *not* classified as a chemical weapon under the CWC because its primary action is incendiary, not a chemical effect on life processes. The inclusion of these inaccurate and misleading statements makes the question more challenging for the candidate.



**6. Consider the following applications of Tantalum:**

1.  In the production of fertilizers.
2. In electronics and semiconductors.
3. In nuclear power plants.
4. In the aerospace industry (aeroplanes).
5. As a substitute for Platinum in some applications.

How many of the above are correct applications of Tantalum?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Tantalum's high melting point, corrosion resistance, and other properties make it suitable for various applications.  Options 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all correct uses; it's used extensively in electronics, nuclear reactors, aircraft components, and as a platinum substitute where its properties are advantageous.  However, option 1 (fertilizer production) is incorrect.  Tantalum is not a common component in fertilizer manufacturing.  The inclusion of this incorrect and somewhat plausible distractor raises the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge of tantalum's applications to answer correctly.


**7. Consider the following about Hyperloop technology:**

1. It's a proposed ultra-high-speed ground transportation system.
2.  It operates at speeds exceeding 700 miles per hour.
3. It relies solely on air resistance for propulsion.
4. It's immune to all weather conditions.
5. It has three essential elements: tube, pod, and terminal.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding Hyperloop?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 5
(c) 3, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 are accurate. Hyperloop is indeed a high-speed ground transportation concept, aiming for speeds above 700 mph, and it's characterized by its three core components: the tube, the pod, and the terminal.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; Hyperloop doesn't rely on air resistance for propulsion; instead, it uses magnetic levitation and propulsion to minimize friction and air resistance.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate; while designed to be less affected by weather, it's not entirely immune to all weather conditions (severe weather could still impact operations). The inclusion of these inaccurate statements enhances the question's complexity.


**8. Consider the following isotopes of Carbon:**

1. Carbon-12
2. Carbon-14
3. Carbon-41

Which of the above are naturally occurring isotopes?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are naturally occurring isotopes of carbon. Carbon-12 is the most abundant isotope in the atmosphere, while Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope used in radiocarbon dating. Carbon-41, however, is not a naturally occurring isotope of carbon.  The existence of a similarly numbered isotope (Calcium-41) from a different element acts as a strong distractor testing the candidate's precise understanding of isotopes.


**9. Consider the following about radiometric dating:**

1. It establishes the age of organic and inorganic materials.
2. It relies on the presence of radioactive isotopes.
3.  Carbon-14 is suitable for dating objects older than 50,000 years.
4. Potassium-14/Argon-40 is another example of a dating method.
5. This method can be used to determine the age of non-living things like rocks.

How many of the above statements are correct about radiometric dating?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 5
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. Radiometric dating uses radioactive isotopes to determine age, potassium-argon dating is a valid method, and the technique can be applied to non-living materials like rocks. However, statement 1 is partially incorrect; while it can date inorganic materials, its primary application is on organic matter. Statement 3 is incorrect because Carbon-14 dating is limited to materials approximately 50,000 years old or younger. The incorrect statements act as effective distractors.


**10. Consider the following regarding  the Glycemic Index (GI):**

1. It measures how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood sugar levels.
2. It ranks foods on a scale of 0 to 100 relative to pure glucose.
3. It was proposed by David Jenkins in 1981.
4.  High GI foods cause slow fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
5. It is determined solely by external factors like cooking methods.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the Glycemic Index?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The GI accurately measures the speed of blood sugar increase after consuming carbohydrates, uses a 0-100 scale relative to glucose, and was indeed proposed by David Jenkins in 1981.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; high GI foods cause *rapid*, not slow, fluctuations. Statement 5 is also false; the GI is influenced by both internal (e.g., fiber content) and external (e.g., cooking) factors.  The inclusion of these contrasting statements ensures the question is appropriately challenging.


**11. Consider the following about Avian Influenza (Bird Flu):**

1. It’s caused by avian influenza Type A viruses.
2.  It’s classified into subtypes based on hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins.
3.  LPAI viruses cause severe disease and high mortality in poultry.
4.  The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) has 183 member countries (including India).
5. Vaccination against HPAI is permitted in India.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding Avian Influenza?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Avian influenza is caused by Type A viruses, classified by H and N proteins, and WOAH, with its membership including India, plays a crucial role in global animal health.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza) viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) causes severe disease and high mortality. Statement 5 is also false; vaccination against HPAI is *not* permitted in India. The contrasting statements increase the challenge.


**12. Consider the following regarding Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**

1. It's a non-invasive medical imaging test.
2. It uses X-rays to generate images.
3. It produces detailed images of internal body structures.
4.  It uses a large magnet and radio waves.
5. It produces ionizing radiation during the exam.


How many of the above statements accurately describe MRI technology?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. MRI is a non-invasive technique that provides detailed images of internal structures using large magnets and radio waves. However, statement 2 is incorrect; MRI does *not* use X-rays; it uses magnetic fields and radio waves.  Statement 5 is also false; MRI does *not* produce ionizing radiation, unlike X-rays.  The inclusion of these contrasting statements increases the difficulty.


**13. Consider the following about Methanol:**

1. It's also known as wood alcohol.
2. It's a colorless and volatile liquid with a faintly sweet odor.
3. It's completely mixable with water.
4. Exposure can lead to nausea, coma, and permanent blindness.
5. It is primarily used in the production of synthetic dyestuffs.

How many of the above statements are true regarding Methanol?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements are correct regarding methanol. It is known as wood alcohol, possesses the described physical properties, is miscible with water, and exposure can have severe health consequences including those listed.  It also has applications in the production of synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes.  There are no incorrect statements to act as distractors here, making the question challenging based on the factual recall needed.


**14. Consider the following about  Ethylene:**

1. It's permitted for artificial ripening of fruits.
2.  Its concentration should not exceed 100 ppm during ripening.
3. Any source of ethylene gas coming in direct contact with fruits is permitted.
4. It's a colorless, odorless, and non-flammable gas.
5.  It is mainly used in the production of plastics.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the use and properties of Ethylene in food technology?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 5
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Ethylene is permitted for fruit ripening, but its concentration must be controlled (below 100 ppm). Statement 3 is incorrect; direct contact is *not* permitted.  Statement 4 is partially correct. While it is colorless and odorless, it is flammable. Statement 5 is also correct as ethylene is widely used in the production of plastics.  The inclusion of partially correct and incorrect statements makes the question challenging.


**15. Consider the following regarding Liquid Nitrogen:**

1. It's a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-corrosive liquid.
2. It has a temperature of -196°C.
3. It's used for freezing and transporting food products.
4.  It can cause cold burns and frostbite upon skin contact.
5. It's primarily used for producing synthetic fibers.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Liquid Nitrogen?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation justifying the correct answer and explaining why the other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
2.  Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
3.  Cry2Ai gene
4.  Glucosinolates

How many of the above are associated with genetically modified (GM) or gene-edited crops in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a bacterium whose genes are used in Bt cotton, a genetically modified (GM) crop in India.  Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is another bacterium whose genes were used in the development of GM mustard (DMH-11), although this crop has not yet received commercial approval. The Cry2Ai gene is a specific gene used in a new variety of Bt cotton to combat pink bollworm resistance.  Glucosinolates are compounds found in mustard plants; the reduction of glucosinolates was the goal of the gene-editing effort that created a low-pungent mustard variety.  Therefore, three of the listed elements (Bt, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Cry2Ai) are directly related to GM or gene-edited crops in India.  Option (a) is incorrect because it underestimates the number of relevant elements. Option (b) is also incorrect because it understates the number. Option (d) is incorrect because glucosinolates, while relevant to the context of gene-edited mustard, are not themselves components of genetic modification.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST)
2.  Pronuclear Transfer (PNT)
3.  Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT)
4.  Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)

How many of the above are techniques or treatments related to manipulating or replacing genetic material to prevent or treat inherited diseases?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are both techniques used in mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), also known as "three-parent baby" procedures, to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from mother to child. Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT) is another name for this procedure.  These techniques involve manipulating genetic material to replace faulty mitochondria. Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) is a distinct treatment where enzymes are supplied to compensate for enzyme deficiencies, not directly manipulating the genetic material itself. Therefore, three of the listed items (MST, PNT, and MDT) are directly related to manipulating genetic material to prevent or treat inherited diseases. Option (a) is incorrect as it underrepresents the number of relevant techniques. Option (b) is also incorrect for the same reason. Option (d) is incorrect because ERT, while treating genetic diseases, doesn't involve altering the genetic material directly.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  CRISPR/Cas9
2.  Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs)
3.  Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)
4.  Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA)

How many of the above are genome editing techniques?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR/Cas9, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are all types of site-directed nucleases (SDNs) used in genome editing. They differ in their mechanisms for targeting specific DNA sequences but share the common goal of modifying an organism's genome. Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) is a distinct analytical technique used in radiometric dating, not a genome editing method.  Therefore, three of the listed items are genome editing techniques. Option (a) is incorrect because it understates the number of genome editing techniques. Option (b) is also incorrect for the same reason. Option (d) is incorrect because ATTA is not a genome editing technique.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Aedes aegypti
2.  Aedes albopictus
3.  Chikungunya virus
4.  Zika virus

How many of the above are associated with mosquito-borne viral diseases?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are mosquito species that transmit both chikungunya and Zika viruses.  Chikungunya virus and Zika virus are both arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) transmitted by these mosquitoes.  Therefore, all four elements are directly linked to mosquito-borne viral diseases.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they underestimate the number of relevant elements.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Glycemic Index (GI)
2.  Glycemic Load (GL)
3.  Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
4.  Ethylene

How many of the above are related to factors influencing blood sugar levels or food processing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood sugar levels. The Glycemic Load (GL) considers both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates to estimate the blood sugar response. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a gut hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and appetite, and is also targeted by some weight-loss drugs. Ethylene is a plant hormone used in artificial ripening of fruits, which affects the sugar content and overall quality of the food. Therefore, all four elements are related to blood sugar levels or food processing.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they underrepresent the interconnectedness of these concepts.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  Monazite
2.  Thorium-232
3.  Uranium-233
4.  Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs)

How many of the above are associated with India's three-stage nuclear power program?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Monazite is a mineral that contains thorium, a key element in India's three-stage nuclear program. Thorium-232 is the fertile material that is converted into fissile Uranium-233 in the second and third stages. Uranium-233 is the fissile material used in advanced thorium reactors. Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are the reactors used in the first stage of the program.  All four elements are integral components or products of India's three-stage nuclear power program. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they underestimate the comprehensive involvement of these elements in India's nuclear power strategy.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs)
2.  Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs)
3.  Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
4.  Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR)

How many of the above are types of advanced nuclear reactors?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) are advanced reactors designed for efficient fuel utilization and waste reduction. Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are another type of advanced reactor with inherent safety features. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are smaller, safer, and more easily deployable reactors than traditional designs. The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is a specific example of an FBR under development in India.  Therefore, all four are types of advanced nuclear reactors, albeit with different designs and characteristics.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they fail to recognize the diversity of advanced nuclear reactor technologies.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)
2.  Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)
4.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

How many of the above are involved in setting international or national food standards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is a joint body of the WHO and FAO that develops international food standards. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) sets national food safety and quality standards in India. The World Health Organization (WHO) is involved in setting global health standards, including those related to food safety. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also contributes to international food standards through its work with the CAC.  Therefore, all four organizations play a role in setting food standards at either the international or national level. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they fail to account for the multiple organizations contributing to food standards.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO)
2.  Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994
3.  Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act (THOTA) 2011
4.  Xenotransplantation

How many of the above are related to organ and tissue transplantation in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Organ and Tissue Transplantation Organisation (NOTTO) is the Indian organization responsible for coordinating and regulating organ and tissue transplantation.  The Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994 and the Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act (THOTA) 2011 are the two major pieces of legislation governing organ transplantation in India.  Xenotransplantation, while relevant to the broader field of transplantation, is not specifically focused on the Indian regulatory or organizational framework. Therefore, three of the listed items directly relate to organ and tissue transplantation within the Indian context. Option (a) is incorrect because it underestimates the number of related elements.  Option (b) is also incorrect for the same reason.  Option (d) is incorrect because xenotransplantation, while a related concept, is not directly focused on the Indian regulatory framework.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS)
2.  Heat Not Burn Products
3.  e-Hookah
4.  Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act (PECA) 2019

How many of the above are directly addressed by the Indian legislation concerning e-cigarettes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act (PECA) 2019 specifically bans Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), Heat Not Burn Products, and e-Hookahs in India.  These are all considered forms of e-cigarettes under the act. Therefore, all four elements are directly addressed by the Indian legislation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incorrect because they fail to recognize the comprehensive scope of the PECA 2019 in banning various forms of e-cigarettes.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  A bright and brief burst of electromagnetic radiation.
2.  Usually lasts thousandths of a second.
3.  Observed in radio-wave frequencies.
4.  Energy loss during Earth's arrival makes them difficult to detect.
5.  Dispersion, caused by hot gas, allows scientists to measure invisible matter between galaxies.


Which of the above features accurately describes Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)?

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the features listed (1 through 5) accurately describe Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).  FRBs are indeed bright, brief bursts of electromagnetic radiation, typically lasting only thousandths of a second and observed in radio-wave frequencies.  The energy loss as they travel to Earth makes detection challenging, a key characteristic often highlighted in scientific literature.  Crucially, the phenomenon of dispersion, where low-frequency radio waves slow down more than higher-frequency waves while passing through intergalactic gas, is a crucial aspect of FRB research, allowing astronomers to study the otherwise invisible matter between galaxies.  Therefore, option (a) is the only comprehensive and accurate answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) omit crucial defining characteristics of FRBs, making them incorrect.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Most powerful and violent explosions in the known universe.
2.  Brief flashes of high-energy light from explosive events like black hole births or neutron star collisions.
3.  Become the brightest source of electromagnetic radiation upon eruption.
4.  Ionize molecules in the ionosphere, potentially affecting the entire layer.
5.  A recent study suggests they can temporarily destroy the ozone layer.

Which of the above statements correctly characterize Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)?

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are indeed characterized by all five statements. They are the most powerful explosions known, resulting from cataclysmic events such as the formation of black holes or the collision of neutron stars.  Their brief flashes of high-energy light make them exceptionally bright sources of electromagnetic radiation. The ionization of molecules in the ionosphere, and potentially the entire ionosphere, is a significant effect.  Furthermore, recent research suggests a potential link between GRBs and temporary ozone layer depletion, supporting statement 5.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incomplete and fail to capture the full scope of GRBs' characteristics.  Therefore, only (a) is entirely correct.

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe the asteroid 2023 FW13, which has been classified as a "quasi-moon." It's a recently discovered asteroid that shares a similar orbital period around the sun as Earth, experiencing a slight gravitational influence from our planet.  This unique orbital relationship is what earns it the designation of a quasi-moon or quasi-satellite.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more defining characteristics of this celestial body.  Therefore, the only correct answer is (d).


**4. Consider the following statements about a specific phenomenon:**

5.  A phenomenon experienced only once a year at a particular location.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the "Zero Shadow Day" phenomenon?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four of the five statements accurately describe the "Zero Shadow Day."  The sun being directly overhead (1) leads to the vanishing of shadows (2) for symmetrical, vertical objects. This occurs in locations between the tropics (3) due to the Earth's tilt and the sun's apparent movement north and south (4).  However, statement 5 is incorrect; at a given location between the tropics, a zero shadow day can occur twice a year, once during the sun's northward movement and again during its southward movement.  Options (a), (c), and (d) either exclude true statements or include the false one. Only (b) correctly identifies the four accurate descriptions of this phenomenon.

How many of the above features accurately describe a "Blazar"?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Four of the five statements accurately describe Blazars. They are galaxies powered by supermassive black holes (1), ranking among the brightest and most powerful cosmic objects (2) and emitting highly energetic radiation and particles (3).  The Indian Astronomical Observatory's recent observations of BL Lacertae's brightening (4) further exemplify this. However, statement 5 is incorrect; Blazars are not exclusively located in the Andromeda galaxy. They can be found throughout the universe.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly limit the number of accurate characteristics.  Only (d) correctly identifies the four features that define a Blazar.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  Discreet electromagnetic emissions observed in Earth's inner magnetosphere.
2.  Transverse plasma waves.
3.  Generated in equatorial latitudes and propagate along magnetic field lines.

5.  Exclusively detected in the Earth's ionosphere at the poles.

How many of the above characteristics accurately describe Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Four of the five statements correctly describe EMIC waves.  They are indeed discreet electromagnetic emissions (1), specifically transverse plasma waves (2), originating in equatorial latitudes and propagating along magnetic field lines (3).  Importantly, they cause the precipitation of energetic electrons ("killer electrons") that pose a threat to space-based technology (4).  However, statement 5 is false; while EMIC waves do affect the high-latitude ionosphere, they are not exclusively detected there. Their generation and propagation pathway are more complex than the statement suggests.  Options (a), (b), and (d) fail to accurately reflect the number of correct characteristics.  Only (c) correctly identifies the four accurate statements.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Glycemic Index and related concepts?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. GI does measure how quickly carbohydrates raise blood sugar (1).  It was indeed proposed by Professor David Jenkins (3). And, GL does consider both GI and the amount of carbohydrates (4).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; a GI of 100 indicates a *faster* rise in blood sugar than a GI of 50.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; high GI foods are associated with an *increased*, not reduced, risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.

(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. Retrotransposons do replicate via reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate (1).  They are indeed found in significant proportions within metazoan (animal) genomes (3). However, statement 2 is incorrect; they are found in eukaryotic, not prokaryotic, genomes. Statement 4 is also incorrect; their replication mechanism fundamentally *requires* reverse transcriptase. Statement 5 is incorrect; retrotransposons play a significant role in genomic evolution through their transposition and ability to alter gene expression and structure. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 correctly describe retrotransposons.

This completes the set of ten MCQs.  Remember that the difficulty is designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates by requiring precise factual recall and the ability to discern subtle differences between closely related concepts.


**1. Consider the following statements about synthetic human embryos:**

1. They closely resemble natural embryos in their initial developmental stages.
2. They possess cells destined to form the placenta and yolk sac.
3. They exhibit a fully developed beating heart and brain.
4. They are instrumental in understanding the "black box" of early human development.

How many of the above statements accurately describe synthetic human embryos as presented in the provided text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate representations of synthetic human embryos as described in the text.  Synthetic embryos mirror the early stages of natural embryonic development, containing cells that would normally give rise to structures like the placenta and yolk sac.  Their creation is also directly relevant to understanding the poorly understood period of human development before pregnancy can be detected by scans, often referred to as the "black box."  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that these synthetic embryos *lack* a beating heart or brain development.  This is a crucial detail that differentiates them from fully developed embryos.  The inclusion of statement 3 serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific details.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from misleading statements.


**2. Consider the following applications of stem cells:**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Applications 1, 3, and 4 are accurately depicted in the provided text. Stem cells are valuable tools for understanding disease mechanisms, SCT utilizes stem cells to repair damaged tissue, and toxicology studies leverage them to assess drug impacts. However, application 2 is inaccurate. While stem cells hold immense promise for treating genetic disorders, the text does not mention direct gene replacement within embryos as a current application.  This is a key differentiator, testing factual recall and understanding of the limitations of current stem cell technology.  The potential of gene editing technologies is implied, but not as a direct application of stem cells themselves in the described context. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between potential future applications and presently established uses.


**3. Consider the following characteristics of CAR T-cell therapy:**

1.  It employs genetically modified T cells to target and destroy cancer cells.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Characteristics 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the description of CAR T-cell therapy.  It utilizes genetically modified T cells to target cancer, it achieves high precision, and it typically involves a limited number of infusions. However, characteristic 2 is incorrect.  CAR T-cell therapy contrasts with chemotherapy; it uses the body's own immune system rather than directly administering cytotoxic drugs to kill cancer cells.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the mechanism of action.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of the differences between immunotherapy and traditional cancer treatment methods.  The inclusion of characteristic 2 serves as a significant distractor, challenging the candidate to accurately differentiate between similar but distinct therapeutic approaches.


**4. Consider the following features of NexCAR19 (Actalycabtagene autoleucel):**

How many of these features are correctly attributed to NexCAR19 according to the given information?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Features 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. NexCAR19 is indeed an indigenously developed CAR T-cell therapy approved by CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation).  It targets leukemia and B-cell lymphomas, and it uses genetically modified patient T cells.  However, feature 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that NexCAR19 targets cells expressing the CD19 protein, not CD20.  This subtle difference tests precise factual recall and attention to detail.  The similar nature of CD19 and CD20, both being biomarkers on B lymphocytes, increases the difficulty and makes it a strong distractor. The question assesses the candidate's ability to recall specific details and avoid being misled by closely related but incorrect information.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the DEEP project:**

How many of these statements accurately reflect the DEEP project's characteristics as described in the text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly describe the DEEP project. It is a five-year initiative studying NCDs across diverse populations, it focuses on underrepresented groups, and CSIR-CCMB is a key collaborator. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While researchers from the University of Bristol and London are involved, the text clearly indicates that the project is a *collaboration* with research groups *across the world*, including CSIR-CCMB in India. This makes it a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to understand the collaborative nature of the project and avoid being misled by an incomplete description. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to interpret information about international collaborations.


**6. Consider the following regarding the use of pigs in xenotransplantation:**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the reasons for using pigs in xenotransplantation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct justifications for using pigs in xenotransplantation.  Their organs exhibit anatomical similarity to human organs, and they are relatively easy to genetically modify to reduce the risk of rejection. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The text implies that pigs are suitable because they *grow quickly* and have *large litters*, not that they have a short lifespan.  Statement 4 is also incorrect.  The text mentions that xenotransplantation was first attempted in the 1980s with limited success due to organ rejection.  This demonstrates the recent and ongoing research in the field, highlighting its challenges. This question tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate the suitability of pigs for xenotransplantation based on accurate information and to distinguish between factual information and misleading statements.  The inclusion of statements 3 and 4 provides strong distractors.

1.  CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)
2.  Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) enzyme
3.  Guide RNA (gRNA)
4.  Reverse Transcriptase enzyme

How many of the above are essential components of the basic CRISPR-Cas9 system as described in the text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR, Cas9 enzyme, and guide RNA (gRNA) are fundamental components of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. CRISPR sequences guide the Cas9 enzyme to the target DNA location, and the gRNA determines the specific target site for modification.  However, reverse transcriptase is not a core component of the *basic* CRISPR-Cas9 system.  While some advanced CRISPR applications might incorporate reverse transcriptase to integrate new genetic material, the text does not describe it as essential for the basic mechanism. This distinction is important for understanding the fundamental process and its variations. This question tests precise factual recall and conceptual understanding of the core mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, differentiating essential elements from those used in more specialized applications.  The inclusion of reverse transcriptase serves as a strong distractor, challenging the candidate's nuanced understanding of the technology.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The mission aims for elimination by 2047, utilizes a three-pillar strategy (Health Promotion, Prevention, Holistic Management), and emphasizes affordable and accessible care. Statement 3 is incorrect. The mission initially covers the 0-18 age group, with plans to expand to the 0-40 age group, making statement 3 a misleading distractor. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the scope and strategy of a national health initiative.  The incorrect statement acts as a strong distractor, challenging the candidate to accurately recall the specific age groups targeted.


**9. Consider the following about Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT):**

1. It involves replacing faulty mitochondria in a mother's egg or embryo with healthy mitochondria from a donor egg.
2. It is a form of in-vitro fertilization (IVF).
3. It is primarily indicated when there is a low risk of mitochondrial diseases being passed from mother to child.
4. The procedure involves combining the genetic material of the parents with healthy mitochondria from a donor.


How many of the above statements correctly describe Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe MRT. It involves replacing faulty mitochondria, it is a type of IVF, and it combines parental genetic material with healthy donor mitochondria. Statement 3 is incorrect. MRT is specifically considered when there's a *high* risk of mitochondrial disease transmission, making it a significant distractor. This question tests detailed factual recall and the ability to identify the specific clinical indications for a complex medical procedure.  The inclusion of the incorrect statement increases the difficulty by requiring a precise understanding of the medical rationale behind MRT.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC):**

1. It is jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
2.  It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.

4. It aims to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in the food trade.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Codex Alimentarius Commission?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are accurate.  CAC is indeed jointly established by WHO and FAO, and it aims to protect consumer health and ensure fair trade practices. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifies that CAC is headquartered in Rome, not Geneva. Statement 3 is also incorrect. Codex standards are *voluntary*, not legally binding, although they are recognized by the WTO's SPS agreement. This question assesses factual recall about an international organization and its role in global food standards. The incorrect statements are carefully chosen to increase the difficulty, requiring precise knowledge about the CAC's location and the legal status of its standards.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', leveraging plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Genome Editing:**

1.  It exclusively uses CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
2.  SDN 1 and SDN 2 methods always result in genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
3.  It modifies existing genetic material, unlike GMOs which introduce foreign genes.
4.  Gene editing techniques like ZFNs and TALENs are unrelated to genome editing.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while CRISPR/Cas9 is a common genome editing tool, other methods like ZFNs and TALENs also exist. Statement 2 is incorrect as SDN 1 and SDN 2 do *not* involve alien genetic material, differentiating them from GMOs. Statement 4 is incorrect; ZFNs and TALENs are indeed other genome editing techniques. The key difference lies in the approach: GMOs introduce entirely new genes, while genome editing modifies the existing genetic code.  This subtle but critical distinction makes statement 3 the only accurate assertion.


**2. Consider the following regarding the production of lab-grown diamonds:**

1.  The High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) method uses a diamond seed placed in a carbon-rich gas.
2.  The Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method involves subjecting a diamond seed to extreme pressure and temperature.

4.  Lab-grown diamonds are chemically identical to naturally occurring diamonds.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  Statement 1 incorrectly describes the CVD method; it uses a carbon-rich gas, not the extreme pressure and temperature of the HPHT method. Statement 2 incorrectly describes the HPHT method; it uses extreme pressure and temperature, not a carbon-rich gas.  Both methods, however, share the common goal of growing a diamond by crystallizing carbon onto a seed.  Crucially, lab-grown and naturally occurring diamonds possess the same chemical composition, making statement 4 accurate.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.  The explanations provide detailed justifications for the correct answers and address potential misconceptions.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  CRISPR-Cas9
2.  TALEN
3.  ZFN
4.  Gene Drive Technology

How many of the above are considered targeted gene editing techniques?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four options—CRISPR-Cas9, TALEN, ZFN, and Gene Drive Technology—are examples of targeted gene editing techniques.  These methods allow for precise modifications to an organism's DNA sequence.  CRISPR-Cas9 is a widely known and relatively recent technology that employs a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA location for cutting and modification. TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) and ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) are older techniques that also target specific DNA sequences using protein-based mechanisms. Although Gene Drive Technology aims to spread a particular genetic trait through populations more broadly, the initial modification and insertion of the gene drive element into the genome is itself a targeted genetic engineering process.  Therefore, all four are correctly classified as targeted techniques. There are no incorrect options.

4.  Restriction enzymes

Which of the above are essential components of the core CRISPR-Cas9 system?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  The core CRISPR-Cas9 system requires the guide RNA (gRNA) to target the specific DNA sequence and the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA at that location.  These two components are fundamental to the technology's function.  While a Reverse Transcriptase enzyme might be used in *some* CRISPR applications for writing changes into the genome, it is not a core component of the basic system.  Restriction enzymes are used in other DNA manipulation techniques but are not directly involved in the core CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism. Therefore, only the gRNA and Cas9 enzyme are essential components of the basic CRISPR-Cas9 system.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Avian influenza is caused by Type A avian influenza viruses (1), and these viruses are classified into subtypes based on their surface H and N proteins (2).  However, statement 3 is incorrect. LPAI viruses can cause either no signs of disease or only mild disease in poultry; they do not always cause severe disease. Statement 4 is also false; vaccination against HPAI is *not* permitted in India.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding  Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT):**

1.  It involves replacing faulty mitochondria in a mother's egg or embryo with healthy mitochondria from a donor.
2.  It is primarily used to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from mother to child.

(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PHWRs, a cornerstone of India's nuclear power strategy, utilize natural uranium as their primary fuel source (statement 1 is correct).  The fission process within a PHWR inevitably generates Plutonium-239 as a byproduct (statement 2 is correct).  Crucially, PHWRs employ heavy water (D₂O) as a moderator to slow down neutrons, optimizing the chain reaction for efficient energy production (statement 3 is correct).  Finally, PHWRs form the foundational first stage of India's three-stage nuclear power program, setting the stage for subsequent stages involving fast breeder reactors and thorium-based reactors (statement 4 is correct). Therefore, three statements accurately describe a PHWR.


**2. Consider the following features related to nuclear reactors:**

2.  Breeds more fissile material than it consumes.
3.  Employs liquid sodium as a coolant.
4.  Operates at atmospheric pressure.

How many of the features listed above are characteristics of a Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FBRs are advanced reactors designed for efficient fuel utilization.  They utilize fast neutrons, which are not slowed down by a moderator, to induce fission in fissile material like plutonium-239 (statement 1 is correct). This process is unique to FBRs and a key differentiator from conventional reactors. A defining characteristic of FBRs is their ability to "breed" more fissile material (like Plutonium-239 from Uranium-238) than they consume, significantly extending the lifespan of nuclear fuel (statement 2 is correct).  Liquid sodium, with its excellent heat transfer properties, serves as the coolant in many FBR designs (statement 3 is correct).  However, statement 4 is incorrect; FBRs do *not* operate at atmospheric pressure; they operate under high pressure.  Therefore, three of the listed features are characteristics of an FBR.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Thorium Reactors:**

(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Uranium enrichment is a critical process in the nuclear fuel cycle.  It involves increasing the concentration of the fissile isotope uranium-235 (U-235) in natural uranium, which has a low natural abundance of U-235 (statement 1 is correct). This enrichment is necessary because most nuclear reactors require a higher concentration of U-235 to sustain a chain reaction (statement 2 is correct). Statement 3 is incorrect; naturally occurring uranium is *not* highly enriched in U-235; it has a very low concentration of U-235.  Weapon-grade uranium, used in nuclear weapons, requires enrichment to significantly higher levels, typically above 90% U-235 (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, three statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. White phosphorus does have the described physical properties and its use in civilian areas is a war crime. Statement 2 is partially correct; while it *is* used in some cleaning compounds, its use in fertilizers and food additives is misleading. Statement 4 is incorrect; it is not banned under the CWC.  Therefore, only three statements are correct. The inclusion of partially true and false statements tests careful reading and understanding.


**6. Consider the following about Glycemic Index (GI):**

1.  It ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0-100.
2.  It was proposed by David Jenkins in 1981.
3.  It is a measure of how quickly a food raises blood glucose levels.
4.  It is primarily determined by external factors like cooking methods.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Glycemic Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct descriptions of the Glycemic Index. While cooking methods can affect GI, it is also significantly influenced by internal factors like amylose content and fiber.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.  The emphasis on both internal and external factors in the distractor makes the question more challenging.


These questions demonstrate the required level of difficulty, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding precise factual recall.  Further questions could be generated similarly, focusing on other aspects of the provided text.  The limited token count prevents the creation of a truly exhaustive set.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding mRNA vaccines:**

1.  mRNA vaccines are generally less stable than DNA vaccines and require very cold storage.
2.  The development and production of mRNA vaccines are quicker due to well-understood mRNA synthesis.
3.  mRNA vaccines have shown high efficacy, and the mRNA doesn't interact with the cell's DNA.
4.  mRNA vaccines primarily target infectious diseases, with limited applications in cancer therapy.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the characteristics and applications of mRNA vaccines?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. mRNA vaccines are indeed less stable than DNA vaccines and require stringent cold storage conditions to maintain their efficacy.  This is because mRNA is inherently less stable than DNA and is susceptible to degradation by cellular enzymes.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The development and production of mRNA vaccines are generally faster than traditional vaccine types due to the well-established processes for mRNA synthesis and modification. This speed was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Statement 3 is accurate.  A significant advantage of mRNA vaccines is their high efficacy and the fact that the mRNA does not integrate into the host cell's DNA.  This minimizes the risk of long-term genetic modifications and associated safety concerns.

Statement 4 is inaccurate. While mRNA vaccines have been predominantly used for infectious diseases,  research is actively exploring their application in cancer therapy.  This is a promising area with ongoing clinical trials demonstrating potential. Therefore, the statement that they *primarily* target infectious diseases and have *limited* applications in cancer therapy is an oversimplification.

Therefore, only three out of the four statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding different gene therapy approaches:**

1.  Germline gene therapy modifies germline cells (egg or sperm), integrating functional genes into the genome.
2.  Somatic cell gene therapy transfers therapeutic genes to somatic cells, restricting modifications to the patient.
3.  Germline gene therapy is widely used and is legal in many countries, including India.
4.  Both inherited genetic diseases and acquired disorders can be treated with gene therapy.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the nature and application of gene therapy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Germline gene therapy involves modifying the genetic material in reproductive cells (sperm or egg), which means any changes made would be heritable to future generations.

Statement 2 is also accurate. Somatic cell gene therapy involves modifying the genetic material in non-reproductive cells, meaning the changes are not passed on to the next generation. This approach is currently the most widely utilized type of gene therapy.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Germline gene therapy is highly controversial due to ethical concerns regarding heritable modifications and potential unintended consequences for future generations. It is illegal in many countries, including India.

Statement 4 is accurate. Gene therapy holds promise for treating both inherited genetic disorders (such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia) where a faulty gene is targeted for correction, and acquired disorders (like certain types of cancer) where therapeutic genes can be introduced to enhance the immune response.

Therefore, only two of the statements are completely accurate.


**3. Consider the following features of Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT):**

1.  MRT is a form of in vitro fertilization (IVF) involving replacing faulty mitochondria with healthy ones.
2.  MRT is used when there's a high risk of mitochondrial diseases being passed from the mother to the child.
3.  Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT) are the only two techniques used in MRT.
4.  In MST, the mother's nucleus is transferred to a donor egg with healthy mitochondria and its nucleus removed.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. MRT is indeed a specialized IVF technique aimed at preventing the transmission of mitochondrial diseases from mother to child. It replaces the mother's faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.

Statement 2 is correct. MRT is specifically employed in cases where there is a significant risk of inheriting serious mitochondrial diseases, which can have devastating consequences for the child's health.

Statement 3 is correct.  While other variations and refinements of the techniques might exist, MST and PNT are the primary methods currently used in MRT.

Statement 4 is correct. This accurately describes the process of Maternal Spindle Transfer, a core technique in MRT.  The mother's nuclear DNA, carrying most of the genetic information, is carefully transferred to a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed but retains healthy mitochondria.

Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect aspects of MRT.


**4. Consider the following types of immunity:**

1.  Innate immunity is the first line of defense against pathogens, present from birth.
2.  Adaptive immunity develops over time through exposure to diseases or vaccines.
3.  Passive immunity is acquired through the transfer of antibodies from an immune host.
4.  Active immunity develops in response to antigen exposure, like infection or vaccination.
5.  Natural immunity is only acquired through maternal antibody transfer.
6.  Artificial immunity is gained through medical procedures like vaccination.

How many of the above statements accurately describe different types of immunity?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of innate, adaptive, passive, and active immunity respectively. These are fundamental concepts in immunology.

Statement 5 is incorrect.  While maternal antibody transfer is a form of natural passive immunity, natural immunity also includes immunity acquired through natural infection.  A child acquiring chickenpox naturally is an example of natural active immunity.

Statement 6 is accurate. Artificial immunity refers to immunity acquired through medical interventions like vaccination.

Therefore, five out of the six statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding gene silencing:**

1.  Gene silencing prevents a gene from being expressed as a protein.
2.  Transcriptional gene silencing prevents transcription.
3.  Post-transcriptional gene silencing destroys or blocks mRNA translation.
4.  CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference are techniques used for gene silencing.
5.  Dicer and RISC are enzymes involved in gene silencing.
6.  siRNA and miRNA are proteins used in gene silencing.


How many of the above statements accurately describe gene silencing mechanisms and techniques?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  Gene silencing is the process of turning off gene expression, and the different types of silencing (transcriptional and post-transcriptional) and mentioned techniques are valid approaches.

Statement 5 is partially correct. Dicer is an enzyme, but RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) is a multiprotein complex, not an enzyme itself.

Statement 6 is incorrect. siRNA and miRNA are small RNA molecules, not proteins. They are key components of the RNA interference pathway.

Therefore, only four out of the six statements are entirely accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding different types of RNA:**

1.  mRNA carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis.
2.  tRNA transfers amino acids to ribosomes during translation.
3.  rRNA is a structural component of ribosomes.
4.  miRNA regulates gene expression by binding to target mRNAs.
5.  siRNA is involved in the RNA interference pathway.
6.  lncRNA is a short RNA molecule involved in protein synthesis.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the roles of different types of RNA?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all accurate descriptions of the functions of mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, and siRNA, respectively.  These are well-established roles in molecular biology and gene expression.

Statement 6 is incorrect. lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) is not a short RNA molecule and is not directly involved in protein synthesis.  Instead, it plays regulatory roles in gene expression through various mechanisms that do not involve direct translation into proteins.

Thus, five of the six statements accurately reflect the functions of different RNA types.


**7. Consider the following regarding Genome Editing Techniques:**

1. ZFN (Zinc Finger Nuclease) is a targeted gene editing technique.
2. TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease) is a non-targeted gene editing technique.
3. CRISPR-Cas9 is a targeted gene editing technique.
4. Non-targeted biotechnology utilizes traditional breeding techniques and random mutagenesis.

How many of the above statements accurately describe genome editing techniques and their characteristics?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. ZFN is a type of engineered nuclease used for targeted gene editing.  It allows for precise modifications at specific DNA sequences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. TALEN, like ZFN, is a targeted gene-editing technology. It employs engineered nucleases to introduce precise DNA breaks at specific locations.

Statement 3 is correct. CRISPR-Cas9 is a highly precise and widely used targeted gene-editing system. It leverages a guide RNA to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence for modification.

Statement 4 is correct.  Non-targeted methods such as traditional breeding and random mutagenesis are less precise and can lead to unintended genomic changes. These techniques rely on random recombination or mutations to generate genetic variations.

Therefore, three out of the four statements accurately reflect the nature of gene-editing technologies.


**8. Consider the following regarding Recombinant DNA Technology:**

1. Recombinant DNA technology combines genetic material from different sources.
2. Restriction enzymes cut DNA molecules at specific sequences.
3. DNA ligase joins DNA fragments by forming hydrogen bonds.
4. Vectors carry foreign DNA into host cells.
5. Plasmids, viruses, and artificial chromosomes are examples of vectors.
6. Host cells replicate and express recombinant DNA molecules.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the components and processes of recombinant DNA technology?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are accurate representations of aspects of recombinant DNA technology. The process involves combining DNA from different sources, using restriction enzymes for cutting, vectors for transferring the DNA into host cells, and host cells to replicate and express the modified DNA.  Plasmids, viruses, and artificial chromosomes are all commonly used vector systems.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. DNA ligase forms phosphodiester bonds, not hydrogen bonds, to join DNA fragments.  Hydrogen bonds are important in DNA structure but not the direct mechanism by which ligase seals the DNA backbone.

Therefore, five of the six statements accurately describe the fundamentals of recombinant DNA technology.


**9. Consider the following regarding CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing:**

1. CRISPR-Cas9 originated from bacteria's defense mechanisms.
2. Cas9 acts as molecular scissors, cutting DNA at specific locations.
3. Guide RNA (gRNA) directs Cas9 to the target DNA sequence.
4. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR) are DNA repair pathways.
5. CRISPR-Cas9 always results in precise and predictable gene edits.
6. Reverse Transcriptase is always used in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system and its processes?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of CRISPR-Cas9 components and mechanisms.  It originates from bacterial immune systems, uses Cas9 for DNA cutting guided by gRNA, and the cell employs NHEJ and HDR for repair.

Statement 5 is incorrect. While CRISPR-Cas9 is highly precise, off-target effects (unintended cuts in other genomic locations) can occur.  The precision of the edit is influenced by factors like gRNA design and the efficiency of the DNA repair mechanisms.

Statement 6 is incorrect. Reverse transcriptase is not always used in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.  It's employed in some advanced applications where the goal is to introduce a new gene sequence, but it's not essential for the basic gene-editing function of CRISPR-Cas9.

Therefore, four of the six statements accurately describe the CRISPR-Cas9 system.


**10. Consider the following regarding Gene Drive Technology:**

1. Gene drive technology promotes inheritance of a specific genetic trait at a higher rate than normal Mendelian inheritance.
2. Gene drives use genetic engineering to create a genetic element that copies itself onto the other chromosome.
3. Gene drive technology is only applicable to plants and not animals.
4. The genetic element in a gene drive system is always inherited by all offspring, without exception.


How many of the above statements accurately describe gene drive technology and its mechanisms?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  Gene drive systems are designed to override normal Mendelian inheritance patterns, greatly increasing the probability that a specific trait will be passed to the next generation.

Statement 2 is also accurate. The core mechanism of a gene drive involves a genetic element that actively copies itself from one chromosome to its homologous partner during meiosis, ensuring its presence in most offspring.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gene drive technology is theoretically applicable to various organisms, including both plants and animals.  The feasibility and ethical considerations vary depending on the target species and the specific application.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While gene drives are highly effective at increasing the inheritance of a particular trait, they do not guarantee 100% inheritance in every offspring.  Factors such as genetic recombination and potential mutations can still influence the inheritance pattern.

Therefore, only two of the four statements are completely accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are incorrect.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding biofuel production?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Biogas is indeed produced by the anaerobic digestion of organic matter. Transesterification is the crucial chemical process in biodiesel production.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While plants are the source of the sugars used to make ethanol, the actual production of ethanol involves fermentation, not photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis creates the sugars; fermentation converts them into ethanol.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Methanol is an alcohol, often used in the transesterification process to produce biodiesel, but it is not itself a type of biodiesel. Biodiesel consists of FAMEs (fatty acid methyl esters).


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Green Hydrogen Mission:**

1. Aims to achieve 5 MMT of green hydrogen production annually by 2030.
2. Focuses solely on utilizing existing fossil fuel infrastructure for hydrogen distribution.

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the length and complexity of the target content, creating a comprehensive set of questions within the token limit is challenging.  The following examples aim for a representative sample across different aspects of the text.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding mRNA vaccines:**

1.  mRNA vaccines utilize a copy of messenger RNA (mRNA) to trigger an immune response.
2.  The mRNA, protected by lipids, enters cells after injection into the arm muscle.
3.  Inside the cell, the mRNA instructs the cell to produce a viral protein, which is then displayed on the cell surface.
4.  The mRNA from the vaccine integrates into the host cell's DNA, permanently altering the genetic code.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the mechanism of mRNA vaccines?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the mechanism of mRNA vaccines.  The mRNA acts as a blueprint, instructing the cell's ribosomes to synthesize a viral protein (typically a spike protein). This protein is then displayed on the cell surface, triggering an immune response.  The lipid nanoparticles are crucial for delivering the mRNA and protecting it from degradation.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. A key advantage of mRNA vaccines is that the mRNA does *not* integrate into the host cell's DNA.  It is transient, degraded by the cell after protein synthesis, preventing any permanent genetic modification.  This is a crucial distinction from DNA vaccines, which do carry the risk of genomic integration.  The transient nature of mRNA is a significant factor in its safety profile.


**2. Consider the following features related to Mitochondrial Replacement Therapy (MRT):**

2.  Is primarily indicated for situations where there's a high risk of transmitting mitochondrial diseases from mother to child.
3.  Utilizes techniques such as Maternal Spindle Transfer (MST) and Pronuclear Transfer (PNT).
4.  Guarantees the complete elimination of any risk of mitochondrial disease transmission to the offspring.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of MRT?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe MRT.  The procedure aims to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases by replacing the mother's faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a donor.  MST and PNT are the two main techniques employed.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While MRT significantly reduces the risk of mitochondrial disease transmission, it doesn't guarantee its complete elimination.  A small amount of the mother's mitochondrial DNA might still be present, potentially leading to a low risk of disease manifestation in the offspring.  This residual risk is a subject of ongoing research and ethical debate surrounding the procedure.


**3. Consider the following regarding Adaptive Immunity:**

1.  Develops after exposure to specific antigens.
2.  Provides a tailored and long-lasting immune response.
3.  Involves lymphocytes (B cells and T cells) and the production of antibodies.
4.  Is the body's first line of defense against pathogens.

How many of the above statements correctly characterize adaptive immunity?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe adaptive immunity.  It is a specific, acquired immune response triggered by exposure to antigens.  This response is characterized by immunological memory, leading to long-lasting protection.  B cells and T cells, along with antibody production, are central to this process.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. Innate immunity, not adaptive immunity, represents the body's first line of defense, providing a non-specific, immediate response to pathogens.  Adaptive immunity takes time to develop, offering a more targeted and durable response after the initial encounter.


**4. Consider the following regarding different types of vaccines:**

1.  Conventional vaccines use weakened or dead viruses or parts of viruses.
2.  mRNA vaccines use mRNA to produce a viral protein in the body.
3.  DNA vaccines use a plasmid DNA to produce a viral protein after entering the cell nucleus.
4.  All three vaccine types guarantee lifelong immunity against infection.


How many of the statements accurately describe these vaccine types?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the basic mechanisms of conventional, mRNA, and DNA vaccines respectively.  Conventional vaccines introduce weakened or inactive pathogens to stimulate an immune response. mRNA vaccines deliver mRNA encoding for a viral protein, allowing the body to produce it and trigger immunity. DNA vaccines introduce DNA encoding for a viral protein, which is then transcribed and translated within the cell.  However, statement 4 is incorrect.  While some vaccines (like measles and mumps vaccines) can provide lifelong immunity, this is not a universal guarantee across all vaccine types.  Many vaccines require booster doses to maintain adequate protection over time. The duration of immunity varies depending on the vaccine, the pathogen, and the individual's immune response.



**5. Consider the following regarding the features of  Avian Influenza:**

1.  Avian influenza, or bird flu, is caused by infection with avian influenza Type A viruses.
2.  Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
3.  Avian influenza A viruses are classified into two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
4.  Vaccination against HPAI is a widely used and effective method of controlling outbreaks in poultry in India.

How many of the above statements are correct descriptions of Avian Influenza?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe key aspects of avian influenza.  It's caused by Type A influenza viruses, classified into subtypes based on H and N proteins.  These subtypes are further categorized into LPAI and HPAI, based on their virulence in poultry.  Statement 4 is incorrect.  Although vaccination is used in some countries to control HPAI outbreaks in poultry, it is *not* permitted in India.  India's approach focuses on other control measures such as culling, quarantine, and biosecurity protocols.  The absence of vaccination in India makes it a crucial point of distinction for UPSC-level understanding of disease control strategies.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding FSSAI regulations on ethylene use in food processing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) does indeed permit the use of ethylene for artificial ripening of fruits, recognizing it as a common practice.  However, this permission is subject to strict regulations.  Statement 2 is also correct; the FSSAI sets a limit of 100 ppm (parts per million) for the concentration of ethylene used in this process. Exceeding this limit poses health and safety risks. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FSSAI explicitly prohibits any source of ethylene gas from coming into direct contact with fruits during the ripening process. This is a critical safety precaution to prevent excessive exposure and potential harm to the fruit and consumers. Statement 4 is incorrect. Liquid nitrogen is used for freezing and transporting food but is not an approved alternative to ethylene for artificial ripening.  Liquid nitrogen's extremely low temperature (-196°C) makes it unsuitable for the controlled ripening process facilitated by ethylene.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.



**2. Consider the following regarding the properties and applications of Liquid Nitrogen:**

1. It is a colorless, odorless, flammable, and corrosive cryogenic fluid.
2. It is used in cryotherapy and food freezing.
3. Its temperature is approximately -196°C.
4.  Exposure can cause cold burns and frostbite.
5. It is primarily used in artificial ripening of fruits.


Which of the above statements accurately describe Liquid Nitrogen?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because liquid nitrogen is explicitly described as non-flammable and non-corrosive. These are crucial safety features that distinguish it from other cryogenic fluids. Statement 2 is correct. Liquid nitrogen's extremely low temperature makes it ideal for cryotherapy (medical freezing) and rapid freezing of food products, preserving their quality during transportation and storage.  Statement 3 is correct, as -196°C is the accurate temperature of liquid nitrogen. Statement 4 is correct. The extremely low temperature of liquid nitrogen can cause rapid freezing of skin tissue and eye fluid, leading to severe cold burns and frostbite. This necessitates careful handling and safety precautions. Statement 5 is incorrect. Liquid nitrogen is not used in the artificial ripening of fruits. This process typically uses ethylene gas. Therefore, only statements 2, 3, and 4 correctly describe liquid nitrogen.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Methanol is known as wood alcohol, not methyl alcohol. Methyl alcohol is a common, but informal, name sometimes used, but wood alcohol is the more established alternative name.  Statement 2 is correct. Methanol is a colorless, volatile liquid with a characteristic faintly sweet, pungent odor. Its volatility means it evaporates relatively easily. Statement 3 is correct. Methanol is completely miscible with water, meaning it mixes with water in all proportions without separating into layers. Statement 4 is correct. Methanol is an important industrial chemical used in the production of various products, including synthetic dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Statement 5 is correct. Ethanol or fomepizole (an antidote) are standard treatments for methanol poisoning.  Statement 6 is partially correct. While nausea and blindness are indeed symptoms of methanol poisoning, respiratory failure is not a primary symptom.  The most immediate danger is to the central nervous system and vision. Therefore, five of the six statements accurately characterize methanol.

5. David Jenkins proposed the GI in 1981.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Glycemic Index?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Glycemic Index (GI) is a measure of how quickly carbohydrates in a food raise blood glucose levels after consumption.  Statement 2 is incorrect. A GI of 100 is assigned to pure glucose, the reference standard against which other foods are compared.  Foods with higher GIs cause a faster and more significant rise in blood glucose. Statement 3 is correct. The Glycemic Load (GL) takes into account both the GI of a food and the quantity of carbohydrates consumed in a typical serving.  This provides a more comprehensive assessment of the food's impact on blood glucose levels than GI alone.  Statement 4 is incorrect. High GI foods are generally detrimental to individuals with type 2 diabetes because they lead to rapid fluctuations in blood sugar levels, making it harder to manage the disease. Statement 5 is correct. Professor David Jenkins of the University of Toronto is credited with the development and proposal of the Glycemic Index in 1981. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 5 are accurate.

2.  Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)
3.  Guide RNA (gRNA)
4.  Reverse Transcriptase
5.  DNA Polymerase

How many of the above are directly involved in the DNA cleavage and modification process within the CRISPR-Cas9 system?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The core components of the CRISPR-Cas9 system responsible for DNA cleavage and modification are CRISPR, Cas9, and gRNA.  CRISPR acts as a guide, directing Cas9 (the enzyme) to the specific DNA sequence targeted by the gRNA. Cas9 then cleaves the DNA at that location.  DNA Polymerase is involved in the subsequent DNA repair process, which is crucial for the outcome of the edit (either through NHEJ or HDR).  Reverse Transcriptase is used in *some* advanced CRISPR techniques but is not essential for the fundamental DNA cutting and modification steps. Therefore, options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of directly involved components. Option (d) is also incorrect as Reverse Transcriptase is not always a necessary component.  The correct answer is (c), as these four elements are crucial to the core mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, while Reverse Transcriptase plays a supplementary role in some applications.


**2. Consider the following types of RNA:**

1.  Messenger RNA (mRNA)
2.  Transfer RNA (tRNA)
3.  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
4.  Small nuclear RNA (snRNA)
5.  MicroRNA (miRNA)
6.  Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)

How many of the above are directly involved in the process of protein synthesis?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) Only five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA are the three major types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis.  mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome, where tRNA brings the appropriate amino acids to build the polypeptide chain, guided by the mRNA sequence.  rRNA is a structural component of the ribosome itself, providing the machinery for translation. While snRNA is involved in pre-mRNA splicing (a critical step before translation), it doesn't directly participate in the ribosome's protein-building process.  miRNA and lncRNA are involved in gene regulation but not directly in the translation steps of protein synthesis. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underrepresent the crucial roles of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA in protein synthesis. Only option (d) accurately identifies the five types of RNA that directly or indirectly contribute to the process.


**3. Consider the following regarding gene silencing:**

1.  Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS)
2.  Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS)
3.  CRISPR-Cas9 technology
4.  RNA Interference (RNAi)
5.  Dicer enzyme
6.  RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex)

How many of the above are mechanisms or techniques used to achieve gene silencing?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

TGS and PTGS represent two fundamental mechanisms of gene silencing, affecting transcription and post-transcriptional stages, respectively.  CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi are widely used technologies that can induce gene silencing.  Dicer and RISC are key enzymes and complexes within the RNAi pathway. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they fail to recognize that all six elements listed are directly related to gene silencing mechanisms or techniques. The correct answer is (d) because all six components are involved in either the mechanism or the technologies used for gene silencing.


**4. Consider the following types of DNA:**

1.  Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
2.  Circular DNA
3.  Supercoiled DNA
4.  Microsatellite DNA
5.  Genomic DNA
6.  Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

How many of the above are types of DNA based primarily on their structure or location within a cell?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

ssDNA, circular DNA, supercoiled DNA, and microsatellite DNA are classified based on their structural characteristics. Genomic DNA refers to the complete genetic material, while mtDNA specifies the location within mitochondria.  Therefore, option (a) and (b) are incorrect as they do not account for all the structural and locational aspects of DNA. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes functional classifications of DNA (e.g., genomic DNA).  The correct option is (c), accurately reflecting the structural and locational DNA types.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Genome India Project:**

1.  Launched by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT)
2.  Aims to collect 10,000 genetic samples
3.  Led by researchers from 20 national institutes
4.  Datasets stored at the Indian Biological Data Centre in Faridabad
5.  Inspired by the Human Genome Project (HGP)
6.  Directly involved in developing new gene therapies


How many of the above are accurate descriptions of the Genome India Project?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Genome India Project accurately fits the descriptions in points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  The project was indeed launched by the DBT, aimed at collecting a large number of samples, led by multiple research institutions, stores data at the specified center, and is inspired by the HGP. However, the Genome India Project's primary goal is to create a reference genome for the Indian population, not directly developing gene therapies. That is a separate field of research.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect, underestimating or overestimating the accurate characteristics of the Genome India Project. The correct answer is (c), reflecting the five accurate descriptions of the project's features.


**6. Consider the following applications of gene silencing:**

1. Studying gene function in research
2. Treating genetic disorders through gene therapy
3. Developing new pesticides
4. Enhancing crop yields through genetic modification
5. Creating new vaccines
6. Understanding the role of epigenetic modifications in disease


How many of the above are valid applications of gene silencing techniques?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gene silencing is a powerful tool for studying gene function by selectively "turning off" genes to observe their effects. It holds promise in gene therapy for treating genetic disorders by silencing disease-causing genes.  Gene silencing is also involved in vaccine development and understanding epigenetic modifications' role in diseases.  However, developing new pesticides and enhancing crop yields through genetic modification usually involve gene *editing* or *insertion*, rather than solely silencing existing genes.  Therefore, options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they underestimate the uses of gene silencing, while option (d) overestimates it by including the less direct applications. The correct answer is (c), as it accurately reflects the five direct applications of gene silencing.


**7. Consider the following types of gene therapy:**

1. Germline gene therapy
2. Somatic cell gene therapy
3. Viral vector-mediated gene therapy
4. Non-viral vector-mediated gene therapy
5. CRISPR-Cas9 based gene therapy

How many of the above are categorized primarily by the type of cells targeted or the method of gene delivery?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Germline and somatic cell gene therapy are classified by the type of cells targeted (germ cells vs. somatic cells). Viral and non-viral vector-mediated gene therapy are classified by the delivery method. CRISPR-Cas9-based gene therapy is also classified by the method used to introduce the therapeutic gene. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't account for the various ways gene therapy is categorized.  The correct answer is (c) because all five options represent classifications based on either the target cells or the delivery method used in gene therapy.


**8. Consider the following enzymes involved in gene silencing:**

1. Dicer
2. RNA Polymerase
3. RISC complex
4. Reverse Transcriptase
5. DNA Ligase

How many of the above are directly involved in RNA interference (RNAi)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Dicer and the RISC complex are central to the RNAi pathway; Dicer processes dsRNA into siRNAs, which are then incorporated into the RISC complex for target mRNA degradation.  RNA Polymerase is involved in RNA synthesis, but not directly in RNAi. Reverse Transcriptase and DNA Ligase are involved in other processes and not RNAi. Therefore, options (a) and (b) underestimate the number of enzymes directly involved in RNAi, while option (d) overestimates it.  The correct answer is (c), as it accurately points out the three enzymes directly involved in the RNAi mechanism.


**9. Consider the following regarding types of DNA based on function:**

1. Genomic DNA
2. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
3. Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)
4. Extrachromosomal DNA
5. Methylated DNA
6. Damaged DNA

How many of the above are categorized primarily by their function within a cell or organism?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Genomic DNA, mtDNA, cpDNA, and extrachromosomal DNA are primarily categorized by function (e.g., mtDNA's role in mitochondrial processes). Methylated and damaged DNA are categorized by their chemical modifications, not their primary function. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either underestimate or overestimate the number of DNA types primarily categorized by function.  The correct answer is (a), as it accurately identifies the three types of DNA primarily categorized by their cellular roles.


**10. Consider the following regarding gene expression:**

1. Transcription
2. RNA Processing
3. Translation
4. Post-translational Modification
5. DNA Replication
6. DNA Methylation

How many of the above are steps directly involved in the process of gene expression from DNA to a functional protein?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Transcription, RNA processing, translation, and post-translational modification are the four major steps in gene expression, transforming genetic information from DNA into a functional protein. DNA replication is a separate process, and DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that influences gene expression but isn't a direct step in the process itself.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect, either underestimating or overestimating the core steps in gene expression.  The correct answer is (b), reflecting the four direct steps in the central dogma of molecular biology.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Sun's atmosphere:**

1. The photosphere is the visible surface, with temperatures ranging from 6500 K to 4000 K.
2. The chromosphere lies above the photosphere, exhibiting temperatures between 4000 K and 8000 K.
3. The transition region is a thin layer separating the chromosphere and corona, characterized by a sharp temperature increase.
4. Sunspots are cooler, darker regions in the corona with extremely strong magnetic fields.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the temperature gradients and locations of the photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region in the Sun's atmosphere.

The transition region is correctly characterized by its abrupt temperature rise. However, statement 4 is incorrect. Sunspots are found in the photosphere, not the corona, and are characterized by strong magnetic fields, causing them to be cooler and darker than the surrounding area.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the Sun:**

1. Coronal holes are regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields.
2. Solar prominences are anchored to the Sun's surface and extend into the corona.
3. Solar flares are giant explosions associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
4. Sunspots are areas of extremely weak magnetic fields in the photosphere.

How many of the above are correctly described?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe coronal holes, solar prominences, and solar flares. Coronal holes are indeed regions of open magnetic fields. Solar prominences extend from the Sun's surface into the corona. Solar flares are powerful explosions often associated with CMEs. However, statement 4 is incorrect. Sunspots are characterized by *extremely strong* magnetic fields, not weak ones.  Therefore, only three statements are correctly described.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Gaganyaan mission:**

1. It aims to demonstrate India's human spaceflight capability.
2.  The mission will involve a crew of 3 astronauts orbiting Earth at an altitude of 200 km.
3. The launch vehicle is the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III (LVM3).
4. The mission includes an indigenously developed Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS).


Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Gaganyaan is designed to demonstrate India's human spaceflight capabilities. The LVM3 rocket will be used for the launch.  An indigenous ECLSS is a key component. Statement 2 is incorrect; the orbital altitude is 400 km, not 200 km. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


**4. Consider the following about NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation):**

1. It is an independent navigation satellite system developed by ISRO.
2. NavIC provides coverage across India and up to 500 km beyond its borders.
3.  NavIC offers both Standard Position Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS).
4. NavIC satellites are positioned exclusively in geostationary orbit.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 3 are correct. NavIC is indeed an independent Indian navigation system developed by ISRO. It offers both SPS and RS services. However, statement 2 is incorrect. NavIC's coverage extends up to 1500 km, not 500 km, beyond India's borders. Statement 4 is also incorrect; NavIC uses a combination of geostationary and inclined geosynchronous orbits.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding gravitational waves:**

1. They are ripples in spacetime caused by extremely energetic cosmic events.
2. Higher-frequency gravitational waves originate from smaller black hole mergers.
3. Lower-frequency gravitational waves are thought to be produced by neutron star collisions.
4.  The existence of gravitational waves was first confirmed in 2015 by LIGO detectors.


Which of the above statements are accurate descriptions of gravitational waves?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by powerful events like black hole mergers. Higher-frequency waves do come from smaller black hole mergers. LIGO did confirm their existence in 2015. However, statement 3 is incorrect. Lower-frequency waves are believed to be generated by supermassive black hole mergers, not neutron star collisions (which produce higher-frequency waves). Therefore, the correct option is (a).


**6. Consider the following about solar wind:**

1. It is a continuous flow of charged particles from the Sun's corona.
2.  Earth's magnetosphere completely blocks all solar wind particles.
3. Picoflare jets, small eruptions from coronal holes, contribute to the solar wind.
4. The intensity of the solar wind remains constant throughout the Sun's activity cycle.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona, and picoflare jets from coronal holes contribute to it. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Earth's magnetosphere deflects most but not all solar wind particles; some do penetrate. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the solar wind's intensity varies with the Sun's activity cycle. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following components of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):**

1. A 6.5-meter primary mirror
2.  A large sun shield to maintain low temperatures
3.  Primary operation in the ultraviolet and visible light spectrum
4. Orbit around Earth


How many of the above are accurate features of the JWST?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate.  The JWST has a 6.5-meter primary mirror and a large sun shield for temperature control. However, statement 3 is incorrect; JWST primarily operates in the infrared spectrum, not ultraviolet and visible light.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; it orbits around the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point, not Earth itself.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the International Liquid-Mirror Telescope (ILMT):**

1. It is located at the Devasthal Observatory in Uttarakhand, India.
2. It uses a rotating mercury mirror to achieve a paraboloidal shape.
3. It is primarily used for observing celestial objects at low altitudes.
4. The ILMT project involves international collaboration.

How many of the above descriptions of the ILMT are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The ILMT is situated at Devasthal Observatory, uses a rotating liquid mercury mirror, and is a collaborative international project. However, statement 3 is incorrect; liquid-mirror telescopes are best suited for zenith observations (looking straight up), not low altitudes. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following about Lab-Grown Diamonds:**

1. They are created using High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) methods.
2.  Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is another method for their creation.
3.  They possess identical physical and chemical properties to naturally occurring diamonds, except for isotopic ratios.
4. The process is significantly more expensive than mining natural diamonds.


Which of the above statements are true about lab-grown diamonds?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Lab-grown diamonds are produced using both HPHT and CVD methods.  While possessing almost identical physical and chemical properties to natural diamonds, they differ slightly in isotopic ratios. Statement 4 is incorrect; the cost of lab-grown diamonds is generally lower than that of mined diamonds, especially for larger stones.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are true.


**10. Consider the following applications of Perovskite materials:**

1. Solar cells
2. LEDs and lasers
3. Photodetectors and X-ray imaging
4.  High-temperature superconductors


How many of the above are established applications of Perovskite materials?

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of genome editing.  Statement 1 correctly defines GE's fundamental purpose. Statement 2 accurately describes the use of SDNs as tools for precise DNA manipulation.  Statement 3 correctly differentiates between SDN types regarding the use of foreign genetic material. Statement 4 accurately describes a specific application of GE in developing a low-pungent mustard variety.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided statements.


2. Consider the following regarding radiometric dating:

1. Radiometric dating uses radioactive isotopes like carbon-14 to determine the age of organic materials.
2. Carbon-14's short half-life (5,700 years) limits its application to objects younger than approximately 50,000 years.
3. Calcium-41, with a much longer half-life, offers potential for dating older objects, as demonstrated by Atom-Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA).
4. Radiometric dating can be applied to both organic and inorganic materials, such as rocks and fossils.

How many of the above statements correctly describe principles and applications of radiometric dating techniques?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.  Statement 1 correctly explains the basic principle of radiometric dating using radioactive isotopes to estimate age. Statement 2 accurately describes the limitation of carbon-14 dating due to its relatively short half-life. Statement 3 correctly highlights the potential of Calcium-41 and ATTA for dating older materials. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  While radiometric dating can be used for inorganic materials (like rocks using potassium-argon dating), the method fundamentally relies on the decay of radioactive isotopes within the material;  it's not universally applicable to all materials. Carbon-14 dating, for example, is limited to organic materials that were once alive.


3. Consider the following about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):

1. JWST captured an image of Sagittarius C, a star-forming region near the Milky Way's center.
2. The image revealed details of protostars within Sagittarius C, showing stars in their formation stages.
3. JWST primarily observes in the visible light spectrum, offering high-resolution images of celestial objects.
4. JWST's observations have significantly advanced our understanding of dark matter distribution in the universe.

How many of the above statements accurately describe JWST's capabilities and recent findings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. JWST did indeed image Sagittarius C and revealed details about protostars.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; JWST primarily operates in the infrared spectrum, allowing it to observe objects obscured by dust and gas in visible light.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while JWST contributes to cosmological understanding, its primary focus isn't the mapping of dark matter.  Dark matter mapping is often done through techniques like gravitational lensing observations, which are not JWST's main strength.


4. Consider the following about different types of black holes:

1. Primordial black holes formed in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang.
2. Stellar black holes result from the collapse of massive stars after supernova explosions.
3. Intermediate black holes have masses ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of times the Sun's mass.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the different types and characteristics of black holes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately describe the different categories of black holes and their formation or location. Primordial black holes are a hypothetical type proposed to have formed in the early universe. Stellar black holes are well-established, forming from the collapse of massive stars. Intermediate-mass black holes are a less well-defined category, but observations suggest their existence within the mass range described. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at galactic centers.


5. Consider the following regarding the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system:

1. CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, originating from bacterial defense mechanisms.
2. Cas9 acts as molecular scissors, cutting DNA at specific locations guided by guide RNA (gRNA).
3. DNA repair mechanisms, including Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homology Directed Repair (HDR), are utilized to modify DNA after cutting.
4. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is exclusively used for therapeutic purposes in treating genetic disorders.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the CRISPR-Cas9 system and its function?

(a) Only one

How many of the above statements accurately describe space weather and its impacts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. Space weather is driven by solar activity, including solar flares and CMEs. These events can lead to geomagnetic storms with various consequences. However, statement 4 is incorrect; space weather impacts satellites in both geosynchronous and low Earth orbits.  LEO satellites are particularly vulnerable to increased atmospheric drag during geomagnetic storms.


9. Consider the following regarding  superconductivity:

1. Superconductivity is a phenomenon where materials exhibit zero electrical resistance below a critical temperature.
2. The Meissner effect describes the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor.
3. Room-temperature superconductivity has been consistently and reliably demonstrated in the material LK-99.
4. Superconductivity has applications in various fields, including energy transmission and medical imaging.

How many of the above statements accurately describe superconductivity and its properties?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Superconductivity is characterized by zero resistance below a critical temperature, and the Meissner effect is a key characteristic. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the claims of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 have been proven inconsistent. While statement 4 is largely correct, it needs some qualification. Superconductivity does have potential applications in energy transmission and medical imaging, but these are largely still under development and not widespread in practice.


10. Consider the following regarding  nanoparticles and nanohybrids:

1. Nanoparticles are materials with sizes typically ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers.
2. Nanohybrids are made by combining at least two different types of nanoparticles.

**1. Consider the following features of a specific layer of the Sun's atmosphere:**

1. Located between 400 km and 2100 km above the solar surface.
2. Temperature varies from approximately 4000 K at the bottom to 8000 K at the top.
3.  Characterized by spicules, which are jet-like features.
4.  Plays a crucial role in the heating of the corona.

Which layer of the Sun's atmosphere is being described?

(a) Photosphere
(b) Corona
(c) Chromosphere
(d) Transition Region


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description accurately depicts the chromosphere.  The temperature range and altitude precisely match the chromosphere's characteristics. The presence of spicules, small, bright jets of plasma, is a key feature of this layer.  While the chromosphere contributes to coronal heating, it's not the primary mechanism.

(a) is incorrect because the photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun, much lower in altitude and significantly hotter at its base (around 6500 K). (b) is incorrect as the corona is the outermost layer, far hotter (500,000 K or more). (d) is incorrect because the transition region is a very narrow layer between the chromosphere and corona, marked by a rapid temperature increase, not the gradual increase described.


**2. Consider the following regarding sunspots:**

1. Appear darker due to lower temperature compared to surrounding regions.
2. Associated with regions of open, unipolar magnetic fields.
3. Form in the corona, the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere.
4. Their formation is linked to the twisting of magnetic field lines.

How many of the above statements about sunspots are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Only statements 1 and 4 are accurate. Sunspots are cooler than their surroundings, making them appear darker. Their formation is indeed linked to the intense magnetic fields and their twisting. However, statement 2 is incorrect because sunspots are associated with strong, *closed*, bipolar magnetic fields, not open, unipolar ones. Statement 3 is also incorrect; sunspots form in the photosphere, not the corona.


**3. Consider the following phenomena related to solar activity:**

1.  Picoflare jets, small-scale energy releases from coronal holes.
2.  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs), large-scale plasma ejections.
3.  Solar flares, giant explosions on the Sun's surface.
4.  Solar prominences, large bright features extending from the Sun's surface.

Which of these phenomena are primarily associated with the release of charged particles into space?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 accurately describe tidal locking. The synchronous rotation (1) means the rotation and orbital periods are the same, resulting in the same side always facing Earth (2). The gravitational interaction (5) causes tidal bulges and slight shape distortion. Statement 4 is incorrect; the far side receives sunlight, just not when visible from Earth. Statement 3 is partially true; tidal locking contributes to the extreme temperature differences between day and night, but it’s not the sole cause.  The absence of an atmosphere is a major factor as well. Thus, four statements are largely correct descriptions of tidal locking.

Statement 1 is incorrect; FSSAI does set a limit (100 ppm) on its concentration for artificial ripening. Statement 3 is also incorrect; direct contact is not permitted. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the use of Ethylene in food processing:**

1.  FSSAI permits the use of ethylene for artificial ripening of fruits, provided the concentration does not exceed 100 ppm.
2.  Any source of ethylene gas coming in direct contact with fruits is permitted by FSSAI.
3.  Ethylene is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable gas.
4.  Ethylene is primarily used for freezing and transporting food products.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) does indeed regulate the use of ethylene for artificial ripening, setting a maximum permissible concentration of 100 ppm to ensure food safety.  Going beyond this limit could lead to harmful effects on consumers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Direct contact of ethylene gas with fruits is explicitly *not* permitted by FSSAI due to potential risks of uneven ripening and possibly harmful residue levels.  Controlled environment and application methods are necessary.

Statement 3 is partially correct. Ethylene is a colorless and odorless gas, but the statement is misleading as it omits the crucial fact that it is a flammable gas.  This omission makes the statement factually incomplete and therefore incorrect in the context of a precise MCQ.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While ethylene is used in the food industry, its primary application is not freezing and transporting food products. That is a use case for liquid nitrogen. Ethylene's main role is in ripening.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 (with the caveat about flammability) are partially correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer.


**2. Consider the following regarding Liquid Nitrogen:**

1. It is a colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-corrosive element.
2. It is an inert cryogenic fluid with a temperature of -196°C.
3. Its primary application in the food industry is artificial ripening of fruits.
4. Exposure to liquid nitrogen can cause cold burns and frostbite.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of liquid nitrogen?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. Liquid nitrogen is indeed colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and non-corrosive. Its extremely low temperature (-196°C) makes it a cryogenic fluid, and direct contact can cause severe cold burns and frostbite.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Liquid nitrogen's primary application in the food industry is freezing and transporting food products, not artificial ripening (that's ethylene).  This is a key distractor designed to test detailed knowledge.

Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct, making (c) the correct option.


**3. Consider the following regarding Methanol:**

1. Methanol is also known as methyl alcohol.
2. Methanol exposure can lead to permanent blindness.
3. The treatment for methanol poisoning includes administering ethanol.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's three-stage nuclear power program:**

1. Stage 1 utilizes Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and produces Plutonium-239 as a byproduct.
2. Stage 2 employs Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) to primarily convert fertile uranium-238 into fissile plutonium-239.
3. Stage 3 focuses on utilizing U-233 produced from thorium in advanced self-sustaining thorium-based reactors.
4.  The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) is the primary research institution for all three stages.

Which of the statements above are accurate descriptions of India's three-stage nuclear power program?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Stage 1 of India's three-stage nuclear power program uses PHWRs with natural uranium as fuel, and Pu-239 is indeed a byproduct.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while Stage 2 uses FBRs, their primary function is to breed fissile material (Pu-239) from fertile material (U-238), not solely to convert U-238 into Pu-239.  The conversion of Th-232 into U-233 is a secondary but crucial aspect of Stage 2. Statement 3 is accurate; Stage 3 aims to utilize U-233 from thorium in advanced reactors. Statement 4 is a distractor; while BARC plays a significant role, it isn't the *sole* research institution involved in all three stages. Other institutions and collaborations contribute to the program's advancement. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are completely accurate.


**2. Consider the following features of India's indigenous Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam:**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The PFBR does initially utilize MOX fuel and employs liquid sodium as a coolant. Statement 3 is incorrect; the PFBR's capacity is 500 MWe, not 1000 MWe. Statement 4 is incorrect; Russia, not India, is the first country to commercially operate an FBR. While the PFBR is a significant achievement for India, it doesn't change Russia's prior status. Statement 5 is partially correct; the PFBR is developed under the DAE, but more specifically, by BHAVINI (Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited), a government company under the DAE.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are completely accurate.

How many of these statements accurately describe the characteristics of the mentioned alternative fuels?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate.  Hydrogen fuel cells using pure hydrogen primarily produce water and heat. Statement 2 is incorrect; sodium-ion batteries generally have lower energy density than lithium-ion batteries. Statement 3 is incorrect; biodiesel from used cooking oil is considered a first-generation biofuel, not second-generation.  Statement 4 is an oversimplification; while sand batteries offer advantages,  their lifespan and cycle capabilities are not definitively superior to lithium-ion batteries in all aspects, and are still under development. Therefore, only one statement is completely correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding India's initiatives in biofuels:**

1. The National Policy on Biofuels (2018) initially targeted 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2030.
2. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana focuses on promoting first-generation biofuel production.
3. The GOBAR-DHAN scheme aims to convert cattle dung and solid waste into biogas, bio-CNG, and compost.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the rules do allow for the establishment of dedicated transmission lines under certain conditions without a license. Statement 2 is incorrect; the elimination of the additional surcharge on OA is planned for four years, not two. Statement 3 is correct; cost-reflective tariffs with minimal revenue gaps are a central aim. Statement 4 is incorrect; while state-level distribution is impacted, the rules' scope is broader, focusing on national energy transition and ease of doing business for industries like green hydrogen manufacturers.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the rules.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the target is a 40% reduction, not 20%. Statement 2 is correct; the CPCB does identify NACs based on the criteria mentioned. Statement 3 is incorrect; CAPs are implemented at the state and city levels, not nationally by the CPCB. Statement 4 is correct; the PRANA portal is used for monitoring. Therefore, three statements accurately reflect aspects of the NCAP.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following components of the CRISPR-Cas9 system:**

1.  CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)
2.  Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)
3.  Reverse Transcriptase
4.  RNA Polymerase

How many of the above are directly involved in the DNA cleavage and modification process within the CRISPR-Cas9 system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CRISPR-Cas9 system relies on a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific location on the DNA molecule. Cas9 acts as molecular scissors, cutting the DNA at the target site.  This creates a double-strand break. The cell's repair mechanisms then either use Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) to repair the break, often introducing errors, or Homology Directed Repair (HDR), which utilizes a provided DNA template for precise repair.  While RNA Polymerase is crucial for *creating* the guide RNA, it's not directly involved in the DNA cleavage or modification itself.  Reverse Transcriptase is used in *some* CRISPR variations to convert RNA into DNA for insertion, but it is not a core component of the basic DNA cleavage mechanism. Therefore, only CRISPR, Cas9, and the cell's DNA repair machinery are directly involved in DNA cleavage and modification.


**2. Consider the following types of RNA involved in gene regulation:**

1.  MicroRNA (miRNA)
2.  Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
3.  Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
4.  Messenger RNA (mRNA)

How many of the above directly participate in post-transcriptional gene silencing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanisms act after the transcription of DNA into mRNA.  miRNAs and siRNAs are key players in PTGS. miRNAs bind to complementary sequences on target mRNAs, leading to either mRNA degradation or translational repression. siRNAs also bind to complementary mRNA molecules, triggering their degradation through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.  lncRNAs have roles in gene regulation, but their mechanisms are broader and not exclusively post-transcriptional. mRNA is the product of transcription and the target of PTGS mechanisms.  Therefore, only miRNAs and siRNAs directly participate in post-transcriptional gene silencing.


**3. Consider the following regarding gene silencing techniques:**

1.  CRISPR-Cas9
2.  RNA Interference (RNAi)
3.  DNA Methylation
4.  Histone Modification

How many of the above are techniques directly used to achieve gene silencing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that can be used to precisely target and inactivate specific genes, effectively silencing them. RNA interference (RNAi) uses small RNA molecules to target and degrade specific mRNA molecules, preventing translation into proteins.  Both CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi directly lead to gene silencing. DNA methylation and histone modification are epigenetic mechanisms that can influence gene expression. While they can result in gene silencing, they are not direct techniques used to *achieve* gene silencing in the same way CRISPR-Cas9 and RNAi are. They alter the accessibility of DNA rather than directly targeting and destroying the transcribed RNA.


**4. Consider the following types of DNA:**

1.  Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
2.  Circular DNA
3.  Supercoiled DNA
4.  Genomic DNA

How many of the above are considered primary structural forms of DNA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), although less common as a stable form in organisms, is a fundamental structural form, particularly important in viral genomes and as an intermediate in replication and transcription. Circular DNA is a prevalent structure in bacteria, plasmids, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Supercoiled DNA is a common conformation arising from the twisting and winding of the DNA double helix, affecting DNA packaging and gene expression. Genomic DNA is the overall genetic material of an organism, encompassing all the DNA sequences.  Therefore, all four are primary structural forms of DNA.


**5. Consider the following types of RNA:**

1.  Messenger RNA (mRNA)
2.  Transfer RNA (tRNA)
3.  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
4.  Small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)

How many of the above are considered primary types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

mRNA carries the genetic code from DNA to the ribosome, where protein synthesis occurs. tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA codons. rRNA is a structural component of the ribosome itself.  snoRNAs are involved in processing other RNAs, including rRNAs and tRNAs, but they are not directly involved in the translation process of protein synthesis. Therefore, mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA are the primary types of RNA directly involved in protein synthesis.


**6. Consider the following regarding gene editing techniques:**

1.  Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN)
2.  Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN)
3.  CRISPR-Cas9
4.  Random Mutagenesis

How many of the above are considered targeted gene editing techniques?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-Cas9 are all examples of targeted gene editing techniques. They utilize specific mechanisms to introduce changes at precise locations within the genome.  Random mutagenesis, on the other hand, involves introducing changes randomly throughout the genome, making it a non-targeted approach.  Therefore, three of the listed techniques are targeted.


**7. Consider the following types of gene silencing:**

1.  Transcriptional Gene Silencing (TGS)
2.  Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS)
3.  RNA Interference (RNAi)
4.  DNA Methylation

How many of the above are mechanisms or types of gene silencing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

TGS and PTGS are broad categories of gene silencing, referring to silencing occurring before or after transcription, respectively. RNA interference (RNAi) is a specific post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that can result in gene silencing by altering DNA accessibility. Therefore, all four are mechanisms or types of gene silencing.


**8. Consider the following regarding gene drive technology:**

1.  It promotes inheritance of a specific trait at a rate higher than normal Mendelian inheritance.
2.  It uses genetic engineering to create a genetic element that copies itself during cell division.
3.  It is always used for beneficial purposes.
4.  It invariably leads to the elimination of the target species.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of gene drive technology?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Gene drive systems are designed to increase the inheritance of a specific genetic trait beyond normal Mendelian ratios. This is achieved by engineering a genetic element that biases its own inheritance, often through a copy-and-paste mechanism. However, gene drives are not inherently beneficial and their use carries ethical concerns due to potential unintended consequences. While gene drives can potentially eliminate target species, this is not always the intended outcome or a guaranteed result.  Therefore, only the first two statements accurately describe aspects of gene drive technology.



**9. Consider the following related to  mRNA vaccines:**

1.  They are injected directly into the body.
2.  They utilize lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for encapsulation.
3.  They require a delivery method like electroporation.
4.  They integrate their genetic material into the host cell's DNA.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the delivery and function of mRNA vaccines?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

mRNA vaccines are typically injected directly into the body, and the mRNA is encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to protect it from degradation and facilitate cellular uptake. Electroporation is a delivery method sometimes used for other gene therapies but is not a standard feature of mRNA vaccine delivery.  Crucially, mRNA vaccines do *not* integrate their genetic material into the host cell's DNA; they function by temporarily directing the production of the target antigen within the cell.  Therefore, only the first two statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following  types of Non-coding RNAs:**

1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
2. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
3. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
4. Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)


How many of the above are involved in regulating gene expression?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

miRNAs regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to target mRNAs, leading to degradation or translational repression. lncRNAs can regulate gene expression through various mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. siRNAs also participate in gene silencing via the RNAi pathway. snRNAs are involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a crucial step in gene expression regulation.  Therefore, all four types of non-coding RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression, albeit through different mechanisms.
